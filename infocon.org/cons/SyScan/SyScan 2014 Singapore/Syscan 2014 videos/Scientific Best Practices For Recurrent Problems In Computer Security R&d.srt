1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,709
thanks very much for having here I'm
feel to be it's a scan

2
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:09,130
ice I study a lot of papers PhD thesis
masses this isn't the papers last

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,350
presented its a scam

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,340
were especially impressive to have them
drop your inbox so noble talk a little

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,090
bit about this

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,590
I have a the dynamics is can updates

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,070
a subset of the research that Charlie
and Chris did on dartmouth

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,070
on on car can hacking I sponsor to it is
wifi

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,960
students and got it since we're getting
there if you do not agree

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,300
and to beat it you manage to a own the

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,899
the court dashboard and I'll a few we
also published

12
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:44,399
tools and and softer so that to you
could download

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,399
we did it with tribes the Travis
Goodspeed Scott up there

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,460
anthem we have a a methodology for you
now

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,500
art by bees and so on I can talk about
that little bit more

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,590
late on much of that stuff is available
few

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,600
Fuego you can see the video but we did
here at car can 2013

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,800
and and so on so we have free tools and
so on

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,299
a anybody can do this we did it for
under six thousand dollars we've had two

20
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:08,499
by two cars because

21
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:12,719
bought the wrong car the first I thus
the University wasn't happy with me

22
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,759
so a year

23
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,759
going to talk about the general terms
about the side channels I want to talk

24
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,880
also about my research but the i for
India government told me I'm cypionate

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,069
evidence Daniel but

26
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:28,499
you can talk about that so far have at
white space it is

27
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:32,789
a I'll again it says we suffered I can
talk about it

28
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:36,409
its it's a its bite that out but I'll
talk about other stuff

29
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:41,099
a I'll talk but %uh a systematic
approach is a how to

30
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:44,159
the how to visualize display

31
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,239
Spain widest sense maybe make beat your
cognition

32
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,689
side channels how to analyze them out to
represent them

33
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,749
and I'll choke but some of the more mmm
more

34
00:01:54,749 --> 00:02:00,069
modern techniques so some of the some
other techniques that that people use

35
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:04,009
who are may not be exposed to this
either at the university level or from

36
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:04,529
practice

37
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:08,039
a good in certain environments and
circumstance but not

38
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,060
may not be applicable to others so want
to show maybe some

39
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,370
was general medicine you can use in
order to do this is my contention

40
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,680
that the H of of I love

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,469
experts and hacking will move more and
more into such an analysis into

42
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:25,709
observables she followed some of this
some of the

43
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,989
data privacy data scandals in america

44
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:32,609
it has to be mostly with met the data
which is a form of side-channel

45
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:36,620
so we're yep the and afterwards I'll
give a little for blueprint

46
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,859
I to got this I got started this
research back at

47
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,650
actually when I'm it that I mostly in
2006 some people say

48
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,000
a is there's a new Thomas still deny
don't think so is still the same kind

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,060
decent guy that I met them

50
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,219
a of course I work with Travis help me a
lot and

51
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,959
it's okay I've known since the speech
two years and and postdocs

52
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,140
so too many people to thank but the

53
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,909
you know we all stand on the shoulders
of giants so thank you very much okay

54
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,760
talked about that so this is just some
what we did to the methodology how to

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,739
figure out the

56
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,760
our bodies just forgot I but if the car
that's so you can

57
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,599
I can talk with a little bit more and
you can just google for econ 2013

58
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,010
hotline if the future hubby did that so

59
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,719
my talk is mostly about the a side
channels

60
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,989
and west side channels such channels is
a you know what you

61
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,459
read about or such channels are external
observables that you use in order to

62
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:32,999
infer

63
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:37,120
internal states if you ever work for the
police

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,510
or intelligence agencies and aid teach
you how to read a

65
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,749
the c-myc expression or haha you know
polygraphs

66
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:47,939
are are basically yes the polygraph for
actually looks at

67
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,260
with you get nervous what you think too
much ur your your boys school ties like

68
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,659
that

69
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,739
the site as a trite the from which you
can infer internal state

70
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,799
you can we've seen this such as come pop
up more and more computer security

71
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,279
research

72
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:02,760
can catch anything it could be a time
such annals one of the best

73
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,319
time such annals research came out of
core security in 2007

74
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,769
a.m. I V balancing a a file for

75
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:14,790
upbeat Res data structures from which
the dicta private key

76
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,069
with no privileges whatsoever have a
good work you of course TPA power

77
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:19,910
analysis

78
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,970
you have a less events that's what I
work when as I work at that level of

79
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,440
performance counters events and too hard
defense

80
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,639
EM radiation you know acoustic spectral
signatures

81
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,789
thus research was done the intro more a
was a committee at the time and you just

82
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:35,870
had an update

83
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,169
you many of you may have seen that on

84
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,479
I was announced about two months ago
those they nice research

85
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,599
a give a talk yesterday at the interview
which is a one of the

86
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:50,190
a up-and-coming US's that under fifty
years old I think they're ranked number

87
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,910
two

88
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,580
they could group markus strutting her as
she does all sorts of

89
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,949
crazy stuff on sight on city to at this
is cutting edge and never seen this

90
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:58,440
before

91
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,180
untreated hard for magnetic such an
analysis with put the wires

92
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,759
you know the decapitate but the wise
India awesome stuff I mean really really

93
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,669
good stuff they doing this so I would
encourage it have a look at them

94
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,020
so we're if I'm I have you on the right

95
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,639
you know graft from went up a lot of
resource beef references you can all

96
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,319
hook this up

97
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,580
don't trust anything I say so what we

98
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,919
you can built generic time a time

99
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,930
time inside channels against management
system to get

100
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,610
to leak some information about but they
out at the space

101
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,680
and thus works because I we have a
hierarchy of memory

102
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,310
not talk about a little bit to a bit
longer up more later on

103
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,470
a resolution still not there

104
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,710
some other 100 percent but what we do so

105
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,919
such as are not new there was a polymath
in

106
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,310
the nineteen centuries name was when we
will equalling the term call the

107
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,949
concerns

108
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:57,030
induction I use to as I said recovering
academic a steward

109
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,900
as was the graph to said so in order to
have a party phrase in a three-man with

110
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,729
this is

111
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,940
it means looks like the looks like a
duck quacks like a duck as adept

112
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,210
genome says the key things start the
pope says it's a duck

113
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,430
ill lives in the water all these are
hope

114
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,240
are are information strands which point
hopefully

115
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,979
to same conclusion the more of these
different all three of our panel

116
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,900
independent information strands parts as
point with the same conclusion

117
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,550
that straightened that conclusion I had
this discussion ash yes the

118
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,030
would mark was telling me about some of
the new research at Black Hat

119
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,060
Asia who but the with with

120
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,099
the worst so when we have getting bit of
you know

121
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:39,430
be able to health stuff about you is to

122
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,139
is is to give them inconsistent from
Asian I had a research project at that

123
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,970
in 2006-2007

124
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,310
this is the consumer information both
number 1 I'm going to give you cannot

125
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,729
you can activate a session on single but
also in the world

126
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:56,430
you cannot evade a meeting side channels
unless you want to live like a hermit in

127
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:56,970
the cave

128
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,229
but you can do mess up the data
analytics that you can do

129
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:04,439
and that up that I can teach people how
to do that such much more fun

130
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,650
the sunday you live in Van lot to endure
twenty-years-old

131
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,289
if you know how what point where the
pressure points are on those are twins

132
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:16,500
Soham the a question of course arises
what site chance to have

133
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,620
a and and their surprising many side
channels there was a vapor paper at

134
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,300
at the CCS 2013 on 0 permission aP's

135
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,610
that 10 the from which they the little

136
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,780
baby basic stuff a TCPIP

137
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,710
no a band with you search for which they
inferred

138
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,710
you know we're your medical history for
instance the couple steps in between

139
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,310
but the after this you cannot escape
good side channels

140
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,919
but a so yet many of them you have to
know how to get to know what the type 1

141
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,039
type 2 areas

142
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,099
what does that mean many you have many
causes that map too many side channels

143
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:52,409
and have to figure out

144
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:56,979
which one causes which one which one is
more correlated with the other one

145
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:00,469
Soham there are couple of chances to
this

146
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:04,509
to the site analysts one is a you need
something that's useful

147
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:07,719
now I have left emails most Economic
Research's

148
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:11,490
not useful they're not back till they do
it for ten reasons to do it

149
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,189
so that they have bragging rights to
five the comments worldwide

150
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:19,289
but me I like computer security useful
so anytime you need the

151
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:23,870
eat something actual you need to have a
way of negotiating higher dimensions

152
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,219
we human beings scan them for live in
three dimensions some of us commit

153
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:28,120
allies for

154
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,210
some more fuel be or acid what have you

155
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,860
but we need something for record for
representation that can capture more

156
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,460
than three or four dimensions

157
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,790
at I've looked at that for now suffer
alone for quite some time and came to

158
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,830
the conclusion that

159
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,310
a you have to move out to other senses
you have to be like a baby

160
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,680
recognizes the mother with heartbeat the
best inventions modern times

161
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,940
other not just a flush toilet but the
the heart rate monitor in hospitals that

162
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,860
beep beep beep

163
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,130
it's brilliant and it's simple and it
works you can you that's a

164
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,210
that's a in for that's a a dimension

165
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,910
orel to mention that you that you can
use in order to represent a single

166
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,950
whatever the other thing that you have
to happen which is extremely hard is the

167
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,710
dance unfold in time

168
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,940
so and feature space so I'm the two
discuss

169
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,420
in this car a little bit how to
represented signals that's going to give

170
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,230
a brief

171
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,850
because it's only on scream how to
detect the signals

172
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,810
you'll see some for more advanced sing
that the texan

173
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,910
I'll give him space to mutual
information as relatively new dawn came

174
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,290
out about two years ago

175
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,650
but this very useful and how to prevent
or mitigate the leaking

176
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,680
such observables so

177
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,490
some of them some of the properties that
you have to have

178
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,340
and most people don't do this through
the side on what the

179
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,700
continues on the basis of what they had
for breakfast you have to when I said

180
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,470
she sit down

181
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,690
cyclists if you called something sit
down

182
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,400
your specs you do your I some mature
porn father but you

183
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,010
it's a factor of 10 every minute you
spend in one of the prior

184
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,970
status will save you 10 minutes than 100
minutes and thousands down the line

185
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,630
so you have to think fake the if you
want to useful representation

186
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,940
would know what the what I promise what
their bounds how can you use the minimum

187
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,540
amount

188
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,350
a possible to you know the month
information possible to

189
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,900
extract whatever you need that is useful
one thing that they're not by the people

190
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,440
field pay attention to its capability
you know you were have to be able to

191
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,870
zoom in and zoom out

192
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,490
this is a you know different orders a
man to the special computers

193
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,870
one thing out that I like but being a
computer scientists did you have

194
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,780
we not only to be built the only
university observed but we do this on a

195
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,440
scale

196
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,120
of nine to twelve orders of magnitude no
other signs as far as I know

197
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,570
does that on that scale a small just
look in at the cost was but they don't

198
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,680
look also at that

199
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,600
you know counterfeits have a fatal we we
go from

200
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,790
we go from photonics i channel emissions

201
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,190
people with weakened 2013 at us as
researchers outstanding

202
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,000
guys going to pay for this atomic site
channel said he had up to you know

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,100
worldwide global networks are so many
orders of magnitude so we have to one

204
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,370
has to give somehow thought

205
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,880
into that ago so

206
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,210
then the nature of the date that
determines should determine to a large

207
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:08,720
part

208
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,130
again you have to give some thought into
that a

209
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,270
at least a visual representation I want
to have it is it

210
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,910
is a network which sent Asian most
useful for this or do you need something

211
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,800
that's how r

212
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,450
was people by default to stuff that is
hardcore you know what kind of a network

213
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,060
but

214
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,470
you guys know this from you on the
problems reversing with with with i

215
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,850
doing that we have

216
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,450
your graphical representations in his
even if you have that fishbowl

217
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,580
fish I view it's extremely hard to
follow that stuff down

218
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,050
the promised up and picked it but
someone who comes a better visualization

219
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,240
I think will be a winner Soham as a set
I've

220
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,310
a a look at this bitten a conclusion
that I have to go

221
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,540
to other a to other dimensions orel

222
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,370
hearing touch is to have a project where
I want to have ended web pages on one of

223
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,640
those

224
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,770
you know doesn't nail things that give
to chill input you see the ready for the

225
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,340
face

226
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,590
that it could be that like that some
reaction did that years later with that

227
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,610
would try to bribe you know that
translates

228
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,040
what's on the screen onto something that
can touch did a lot of sense is that you

229
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,100
can still use

230
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,670
that you can still use that you that are

231
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,890
the that could be used useful Ian used

232
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:23,080
use three times that that I use for the
applied for a for such channels

233
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,240
thats how much I want to say about his
Asian the talk about

234
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,510
texan this is the because the crux of
the matter and studying

235
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,720
extremely good papers both both rocky
and box on

236
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,350
I was also struck by you know the
temerity that

237
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,790
had I mean just they look at this the
they found the patent themselves

238
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,300
but you need a but I'll think that will
be a little bit easier to a few

239
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,180
systematic

240
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,200
a methods so one method from for
mischief

241
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,220
and this is sapir to the regressions and
and also to for

242
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,320
I'll splines an awesome admit it you may
have learned

243
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,660
in school is that the mites artistic the
maximal information on

244
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,670
prometic inspiration what this does and
if this means nothing to you

245
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,800
it's too complicated only thing after
members it

246
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,200
it captures a wide range of associations
between different variables

247
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,300
what I mean by that so we're you know
you can catch of course leader stuff

248
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,840
like this

249
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,390
you can capture stuff that's in the soda
like this week after stuff that is

250
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,190
parabolic

251
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,340
also well you can capture stuff that had
that associations that the

252
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,900
go like a like appear scissors circle
horse

253
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,990
a circle with a thing with their woulda
with the

254
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,180
with the line in between you may have
sings that have these properties

255
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,680
but the other other methods will not
find stuff like that

256
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,440
so you can find in your exponential
periodic and and and non-functional

257
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,260
signals

258
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,240
a nonfunctional signals R Us sings that
are not represent or by functions

259
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,530
good news about the mine statistics
which I you sick sense for the

260
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,880
is that that they're pretty insensitive
to noise as extremely good

261
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,670
properties when you want to look at
these Soham

262
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,010
this is probably unbeatable in the
background we think that you that's

263
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,200
one should but the have all this will be
released in can look at slides

264
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,660
the thing of thing as pertinent here in
this in the slide is

265
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,210
as you see that they think it's noisier
and you have you have

266
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,910
equitable degradation of the mic this is
one of the measures

267
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,230
with to all this signal types as the
noise gets a

268
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,690
increases they all produce about as much
which is good news because a

269
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,150
with David Association tab is it's rough
the profit a great at the same time

270
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,810
it's not the same the case what's with
sorting splines

271
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,690
which are a good deal for the new
relationships but are ready to great

272
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,210
very much when there's no noise with
double vision six-year

273
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,230
or with nonparametric regression loss
for people to word it announces

274
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,500
Soham on on the

275
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,100
thats about announced I could the
tec-d_c_ its antes tools are available

276
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,900
for free

277
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,930
you can you can you can put in your
performance counter events you can put

278
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,330
in

279
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,560
whatever else to capture sings interest

280
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,190
to try to distill relationships out of
this we have a

281
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,870
I he lied a little bit foreigners said
there's no way that you can prevent

282
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,410
site chance I should have given an
addendum you can prevent site chance but

283
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,920
you have to work at design-time

284
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,040
this the Saban Research is relatively
recent

285
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,300
even the US a missed regulations the

286
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,590
missed suggestions fits 3 have a V

287
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,800
little reference to actual site channels
but the

288
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,410
they have at go to so who was a
professor at MIT in techno and I think a

289
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,570
just won the twink prize if not mistaken
I want this price

290
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,890
they have a they have an approach of
build at design-time

291
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,680
building function such that you were
minimize that the king of the SIR

292
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,590
this observables a I think that's a
that's a big no way forward actually

293
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,280
nominated

294
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,080
why this paper for the NSA Sep
cybersecurity

295
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,150
research paper 2000 twelfth was very
good the

296
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,360
this is what I want to talk about
submission timing and I can talk about

297
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,330
any results I can give you the high
level overview so

298
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,240
we have a well it's no secret that I i
want to have 2s

299
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,980
the popular defense now when you were
have a campaign

300
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,680
and so on like we had lit scenes first
of 1991

301
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,920
we want to take down the transition
powers give informational to tank so

302
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,320
what have you so what do we do we

303
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,900
we bombed the TV stations be bomb feel
for your support we bombed the

304
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,160
the a a to the major stations

305
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,070
and we have to build them up again so
not only to be bomb them into destroyed

306
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,730
and we kill

307
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,280
you know dozens people around but
afterwards invest forty million dollars

308
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,640
an hour to rebuild that stuff when

309
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,880
what we only need is transmission of
radio to stop

310
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,360
so it would be very nice if the
commander had action option of not the

311
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,740
you know Cali a support Obama thing but
could press a button and deal with the

312
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,100
it'll break the firm so for that you
need

313
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,620
cyber cyber times have a mission tiny
like kinetic planning for which we have

314
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,820
1890 years now maybe made sixty eight
years of data

315
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,760
maybe you know you drop something from a
certain height a doll certain tonnage in

316
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,280
or the blast radius you can cut the %uh
that and all that

317
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,110
the time like this we have nothing like
that for a siberia for sad reality so I

318
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,740
her

319
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,679
multi-year project natural laws for of
in virtual reality

320
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,449
where I'm trying to do that and try to
have predictive loss so we're

321
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,980
and as you they will know because after

322
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,110
we are bound by many more constraints in
the physical world and we are

323
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,610
either computers or even an abstract
mathematics to have many more

324
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,289
yes you have many more degrees of
freedom this makes the

325
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:33,539
the to the station the split applause
much harder

326
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,110
I'll give an example if I throw appall I
can calculate

327
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,110
Newton's Laws in C on earth you know how
far will go

328
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,309
if I there if there is no real
equivalent of you for sending out the

329
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,669
packet can I calculate

330
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:48,850
you know what is that what is the
likelihood how far will it go

331
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,049
I don't have I don't have invents like
that I have in the end

332
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,429
but I but we don't have is not useful
yet so

333
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:58,659
that's what I want to talk about results
but I i cant so

334
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:02,289
went to sweater when I can talk about is
one of them

335
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,230
interesting parts of doing this is this
year

336
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,309
on so I said I work at the level of hi
prevents and performance compass that

337
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:10,909
means

338
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:14,370
a after a little while I was a little
bit like New York in the matrix I could

339
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,409
see when you did a

340
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:19,389
open a socket and print on it but see
the the signals

341
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,700
from the performance from the context
switches from interrupts going on

342
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,269
so is actually absentee fascinating at
but it's extremely hard to distill

343
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:31,490
are to infer back from the effect back
to the cause the reason for this is that

344
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,649
at and this came as a surprise to be
well

345
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:38,080
shouldn't have but it came but after a
while think about it so

346
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,649
a we have superpipe and multi-stage

347
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:44,940
in a multi-threaded programs all the
time for at

348
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,710
the operating system and the ants and my
critics have only one main job

349
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,919
that job is to reduce data latency the
as you know

350
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,549
most processes idle ninety-nine percent
of the time why Perseus pete has an

351
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:58,629
increase but the two agencies to killer

352
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:01,639
saw so what they do but the what the
conglomerate does

353
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:05,039
is it it solves continues the us

354
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,019
space-time optimization problem in
placing whatever of 20 need

355
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:12,970
as close as possible to them processing
unit as you can

356
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,389
a we have about nine or so 89

357
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:20,110
arianna count towards a match that
memory from the Registers nanoseconds

358
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,789
you know not c1 c2 c3 main memory

359
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,879
you know down to hard disk then out to
the network you know USB what have you

360
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:31,460
and that's what does its dynamic complex
feedback system and what it does is

361
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,840
it it flattens execution of so Favre if
I run a program

362
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,769
a I don't gets you know I would like to
be able to discern that a print find us

363
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:41,539
in a certain signal but what it does is

364
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:44,720
it it starts chopping up interleaving

365
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,980
the the out the functionality and and

366
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,179
and and executing our order it's
extremely hard

367
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,279
have a heart that beats in problem and
of how to figure this out

368
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,600
plus you have interrupts sarcastic
interrupting the user from the i/o

369
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,070
serve there pat the zero models in this
is only one model that I found the 1995

370
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,450
the guy became extremely rich and
doesn't answer your emails but the

371
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,570
I'm building up like that sewer anti
thats

372
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,940
ok so when I can talk about his what

373
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,210
how to use mine for that so the so

374
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,950
you have to start somewhere so the
intuition is there that an asset that

375
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,190
sell what we call a

376
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,809
your a Nov program i'd an asset signal

377
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,149
is affected in a signal that looks
roughly like a problem

378
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:32,620
has a start it has a peak it hasn't this
is a

379
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,690
beginning assumption many signals mean
not be like that but I didn't want

380
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,909
something that was more like a

381
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:40,499
that was like a heartbeat that was
regular wanted in effect a

382
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:43,940
I wanted have a cause and in effect that
was found the time to look for these

383
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,879
type signals

384
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:48,029
so-called not a heartbeat not shooting
star but still functional

385
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:51,909
so I was looking I was using his mind
Nick a detection

386
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:55,129
in order my mic approach is not to find
such singles

387
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,749
know that is still you know what 5 if
I'd open a socket

388
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:02,460
if I print something out if I I do at
CES decryption

389
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,730
what the what is a signature to have
that at that level

390
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,840
so use that for we used sigh I chose a
particular

391
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,950
my niqqa sets that represent is
parabolic signals

392
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,019
K one should upon has is

393
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:20,980
if you do experiments and I am an
experimental scientist thats

394
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,129
at least what I hope I am so purpose and
studied mathematics

395
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:28,249
but the the old guard has to die until
you know

396
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:32,049
you know the science cannot should be
protected from math expert writer he

397
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:32,730
knows this

398
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,190
so yeah it's beautiful proves in on
paper but the

399
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,230
you know proof is in the pudding
unexploited as it's in German

400
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,330
now appears catalytic papers be is a
patient you can write anything on paper

401
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,210
but actually matters execution and she
in order to do this you have to actually

402
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,220
experiments if you have but if you have
many factors that you want to bury

403
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,179
say you have want to run it on different
on confirmation to have four different

404
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,090
types

405
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,629
as a and in five levels you have already

406
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:03,779
for to power five different commissions
in there to have

407
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:07,080
a commuter an explosion scene it away of
testing the stuff

408
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,210
inuit in a way that to negotiate this
without having

409
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,720
comment that commit or exposure goes
into hundreds of thousands test

410
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,999
that the could sit US taxpayer inist you
can use for instance

411
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:21,049
ultimate the service tax and the CCM
tool

412
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,419
you can cut down I am and two in 3d in
and we testing

413
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,950
say a if you've take nothing from my
from my talk

414
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,190
have a look at the stools for free you
can download and you can do whatever you

415
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,960
want

416
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,120
up she is so heroes testing well

417
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,480
a difference to have a nice problem that
arris is a computer

418
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,789
in this type of subcommittee timing is
because if the

419
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:46,850
because of the degrees of freedom many
were to be subpoenaed

420
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,340
have no in the computer world in as
opposed to the physical world

421
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,749
is that the mast ass a target matching
problem is much harder

422
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,909
I'll give an example if you have a door
at 1 meter ninety

423
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:00,379
I want to meet its not the doors want me
to ninety

424
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,580
and you are one me to 92 a

425
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,269
you know if you squeeze a bit when you
kick it you can get to that or

426
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:10,340
but if you have something that works on
version

427
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,789
1.7 at the degradation after bridge 1.71
is not

428
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:18,960
is not the graceful may not work just a
little bit less may not work at all

429
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,340
you have a lot of steps and and you know
that you have a lot of step functions

430
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,320
Inc on computer systems that you don't
have an H&H up or step functions

431
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,440
not at all levels at the quantum level
you do a step options but

432
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,809
you in general no macroscopic world we
don't have

433
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:35,909
step functions so good the question is
here if I have

434
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:39,559
configuration and we have partial
configuration of a confirmation

435
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,740
that I didn't espy's on different in the
tech has done a

436
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,059
the system at four gigabytes but this
one has 8 gigabytes will it make a

437
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:46,659
difference

438
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:50,230
it's a it won't okay about 2 gigabytes
or one

439
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,700
worse it's a different processor model
with the signature at the

440
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,149
at the mic architecture will be still
the same them

441
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:00,649
you can predict the checks after months
it's a at least company to get

442
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:04,610
out the still multiple that so what you
have is in a question of distance and

443
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,869
its categorical data

444
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:09,580
it's not like it's comparing apples with
oranges there's no intrinsic relation

445
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,830
between one and the other

446
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,240
so you need to be able to find a
matching

447
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,879
a matching function and this comes on
public paper from

448
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:21,720
from Bora no finding the right a
categorical distance

449
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,999
for a pet goat countries the right
distance functions in order to

450
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:28,110
find best possible closest match didn't

451
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,820
you can ask with this characteristics
was characteristic suffered the texan

452
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,960
mint and what have you

453
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,970
but you only have this characteristics
and you need for that mission can do

454
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,029
that but I can't do that

455
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:40,570
how to select the best month that so
neat need something

456
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,749
you need a you can approach to solve
disc

457
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:47,720
categorical confirmation matching K

458
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,960
so if this award you I'm sorry it

459
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,119
but let me talk about my messages of
course not

460
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,779
as instant as the stuff that was
presented last year so this is one of

461
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:57,360
the excellent

462
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,159
presentations from last year by air the
ok we speak a risky

463
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,860
I'm spell his name and sorry about that
this was a brilliant idea

464
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,070
the fact that I explain this to become
to transmit speed and because it's a

465
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,769
clever guy after eight seconds

466
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:14,759
he said holy moly used a course word but
he said

467
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:17,899
that's that's billions once you
understand and its billing Young's the

468
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:18,539
right away

469
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:22,519
Isles answerer not quite right away like
a sassy times as much smarter than me

470
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,610
but that is a great idea so the media is
there

471
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,580
that you can detect to drop Rupp is much
as computations do nothing you don't

472
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,490
need to form

473
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,779
according to action and I mean if you
hate rock which job or what have you

474
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:38,600
at a I think that with the fasten our
agreement is the one who pulled that we

475
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,070
have

476
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,470
is not anymore what are they gonna for
bit you know the

477
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,619
no branching you can't so rob is
probable that we have to still do

478
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:50,350
exports and offensive for computing so
what he did was he got

479
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,460
let me at the at the performance
counters

480
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,799
events interrupt the certainty built
model

481
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,649
a to to tools to see whether whether

482
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:04,169
at these the the frequencies of these
interrupts on a

483
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:09,039
is is a is indicative of ROP attack
because it has a different type of

484
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,529
signature in that type of in and that
type of space

485
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,210
then the normal execution it's a very
good idea

486
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,269
I like minnie's bill that year's your
one has to think of it that

487
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:22,610
by Costco well says you know sometimes
the duty of the intelligent and to a

488
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,940
state the obvious

489
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,740
so why I I would encourage him to write
more for paper on it I think it's a

490
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,110
its very well done that suggestion that
have

491
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,429
that using the techniques that I that I
that

492
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:39,110
I mentioned is for instance you can
generalize dis this

493
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,659
eat it 9 inside you can have the
side-channel spectral signature of a

494
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:45,799
variety of attacks not disrupt you can
do

495
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,379
the stuff that this may be just what
jumps you can see the

496
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:53,369
you can't write with weird machines like
the machines that beck center

497
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:58,119
and Sergei did the you know we aren't
war for instance hartford-based attacks

498
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:02,360
all of these will extabit signature in
that phase space and you can find this

499
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,860
with this type of mine in Dexter

500
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,169
a a have a high level work plan

501
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:10,320
I mean should use to mix should use if
you can map that

502
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,970
if a little University use MATLAB I
tried to adopt a because my company's

503
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,519
chief and

504
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,989
I hate active I pushed to its limits and
then

505
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:23,279
I couldn't do it anymore consider this
inside me or octave I mean these

506
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,749
gets a map so what and then you have to
have a ballot

507
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:30,249
scientific setup so a I recommend
Montgomery

508
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:34,110
because you have to if you want to have
results that the that you can be

509
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,669
produced

510
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:39,259
need to have a you have a a regime that
is scientific about it

511
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,409
now at this is not for me the stuff on
our on the left hand side but Sarah PMC

512
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:44,080
measurements

513
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,389
of people at columbia and to

514
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:50,659
this is an astonishing result this to me
budget

515
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:55,029
but you can characterize at that level
performance counter level

516
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:59,169
and hard for and my character to level a
programs

517
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:04,600
with the with four with four with four
events in order

518
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,169
this for that happened if they have a
very a unique spectral signature

519
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:11,860
sexy great they do is your day detection
at that level the papers now on

520
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,739
in Review until we come out there so is
a lot white space

521
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:18,929
the sense of open research areas looking
at

522
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:23,190
you know not you know what would win the
32 API calls are made

523
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,220
but what happens at the mic architecture
and and an integral

524
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,529
serve a nice pic John de mi and so on

525
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:36,110
the this rank as one of the foundational
papers

526
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:40,450
offer of this decade I'm quite sure if
this when I saw this when I studied it

527
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,799
said it's brilliant splint is it is

528
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,710
its first but it seventy pages in the
tix in these guys never sleep

529
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,110
so he told me that the never sleep so
this was also presented at ASCO

530
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,369
its box on so what this with this is in
essence

531
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:58,090
is a the sarcasm a it is two things

532
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,309
one it is a it is an example of
concurrency attacks

533
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:05,009
for chose make that fight because I was
predicting that this would come

534
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,269
a and it fascinates fast I thought

535
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:12,519
they have this is the building stone for
Bay for this is that one of the building

536
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,330
blocks for concurrency attacks

537
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,619
and I'll speak a little bit about the
correct syntax later on so what you have

538
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:18,639
there is a

539
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:21,710
you have a a race condition that can
arrive

540
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,379
if you have a to Reid's from you know
from

541
00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:28,450
from criminal to bed Stu virtual address
and you have

542
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,049
and the other spaces shared and you can
have a community height

543
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:35,110
air from from userspace withering 338

544
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,019
and their idea was okay let see will
find will find these

545
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:42,950
will find is to double double fetch
operations and will try to plead the

546
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,619
time

547
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:46,779
so that we can so that we have a chance
we have a

548
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:50,940
with a fighting chance author modified
that value so the time a fair use to

549
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,470
attempt check the time fuse attack at
had to

550
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,899
was a cool you know the they slow down
the cash nine-page bambi's

551
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:02,580
till the flushing they achieved a a four
hours a man should slow down on this

552
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,499
they actually have a refinement of their
paper later on have a

553
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:10,210
talked about list logistic S curves in
all sweet spots

554
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,070
about different types the foot interval
dependence on values have different

555
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,649
types

556
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:18,159
is extremely extremely the paper out
urged a I

557
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,009
which people two studies now why
managing this

558
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:26,440
mention this because you can the
concurrency attack that is displayed in

559
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,429
box on

560
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:31,720
which is them I melts against its okay I
think we have the beginning of a

561
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,960
a weird machine in time this is awesome

562
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,960
is now before we did we had machines
your base on gadgets in

563
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,649
so different space it's still a time a
little bit but this one here is actually

564
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:43,110
built

565
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:47,129
on on Reid's death are modified in time
from say I think it's believed

566
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:50,759
so im me so what can be done is

567
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:54,960
we can have a look at different we can
we can try to distill

568
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,539
stop attacks patterns in in high in
high-level competition language patterns

569
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:01,159
that are used in Palo programming

570
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,669
as you know most of your computers have
a multi-course we're moving towards that

571
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:05,480
because a

572
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,559
well we can't up to frequency anymore of

573
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,869
a far far processors so this is a from a
an article 2009

574
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:17,090
so we have here for different types of a
for different applications different

575
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,529
types

576
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:20,639
of of of language patterns

577
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:23,859
and if you I with the I would definitely
definitely

578
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:27,200
have a look I mean I'm suggests that
every have a look if

579
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,009
at the at us assembled version of these
patterns over and high-level languages

580
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:32,049
and you can find them

581
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:35,249
mean there there to talk to universities
that they're done in

582
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:38,909
in implemented in in packages as you can
see up there

583
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:41,909
high performance computing cad machine
language and so on

584
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:46,559
and find and find you know a
generalization of the stubble for chairs

585
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,950
I'm quite I have an idiot but I will
once a

586
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,220
I the day has 30 six hours

587
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,320
in in finding more if the a general
version of this type of

588
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,419
concert concurrency attacks on

589
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:02,840
the other side in theory in and isn't
this I am working on is

590
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,039
a need to have a model of the control
system

591
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:09,840
those that graph data showed up for the
scheduler and and and paging

592
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,649
exist none I didn't believe it but
there's exist except for that

593
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:18,950
partial base model of the rampaging bear
from 1995 again that I could be rich

594
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,269
lives in Seattle does respond to email
they had a had a

595
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:26,759
disturb rudimentary madala for the
Easter the the rampaging behavior

596
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,619
if you have that if you have that if you
have that happen model you can bring

597
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:35,019
outs a with certain techniques that have
been just tiny it about a year ago

598
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,129
the assumptions the actual control
system

599
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:41,590
the control system assumptions that in
there what I mean by that

600
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,669
mean if you maybe me know the
potentially have such a office 2007

601
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:49,029
so what he did there was a that was a

602
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:52,129
control system attack of the heap
allocation that

603
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:55,739
he allocator is a control out with
hundreds of these hundreds of these

604
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:58,820
in Wes's of these for looked at at a

605
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,480
in a in a different light reformulated
as an optimization problem

606
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,049
with them with a with with constraints

607
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:10,039
these constraints will bring outs to
security relevant assumptions

608
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:14,730
a the it's a it's a completely new way
of going about security audits

609
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,580
so we're there are only a couple people
have done this so far most the

610
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,669
in control theory want someone to defer
the BitTorrent protocol

611
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:24,909
but once we have this control system
other times book

612
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:28,059
can have a brand new way of exploding
stuff

613
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:31,100
it's gonna be awesome okay

614
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,480
so worm what would have a comment if

615
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,749
everything what I said board because
another one of these old-school hackers

616
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:41,830
and yeah I'm as I it's true I'm not many
of these people a much better that

617
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,720
everything I do

618
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,919
what I can do is combine stuff i'd so
without say if

619
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,340
if you want to start doing this you have
to have a model of the system's

620
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,580
stock that the three-dimensional don't
give it some thought this is good for

621
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,009
your character good for your brain

622
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:57,509
and also will give you time to find it a
used a mix that

623
00:33:57,509 --> 00:34:00,629
identify the site of several state youth
like your

624
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:03,820
the like you want to use then used to
make stuff

625
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,869
user use a MATLAB machine

626
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:10,910
MATLAB to visualize these things use
machine learning

627
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,900
but for use machine learning which is a
tricky meet that the Mingus

628
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,990
2012 so well you don't

629
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,990
you not like the big data analytics guy
like Google Flu Trends

630
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:25,690
just through two albums at the data and
got terrible predictions because this

631
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,419
happens

632
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:29,660
a big date isn't new but those buzzword
but if you don't know what you doing

633
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:34,060
you know you get garbage in garbage out
yes to a sec the right machine

634
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,070
she just gets up for Facebook aunt the
reserve a nice base in using modeling

635
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,800
toolkit

636
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,120
call p.m. Tk three which you can use to
make these models and cancer

637
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,179
to a lot of questions Lynn scientific
experiments

638
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,230
if you have certain specialized cases a
if you have something that

639
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,640
if you have a few model a physical
system or even an ICS

640
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,650
nice s actually would work I'm pretty
sure it would work I've done it

641
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:59,410
but I P should work you can use Eureka
Nicholas the

642
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:03,370
were distilled natural laws from from
data was actually amazing

643
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,910
was a double pendant was done by hard
it's not Cornell a

644
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:11,160
it sets that's why it's called Rica have
a look at nasa serves you points

645
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,740
it's for a higher purpose its it it is
for free

646
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,370
and it can visualize a maybe large
datasets

647
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:22,170
in his across sections of many to
mention shows always three dimensions

648
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,970
three times no three-time 32 D
representations

649
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,130
at the same time the good news is that
if you go and change something in one

650
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,350
representations say dimensions 1&2 chain
something there

651
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,210
those values it adapts on the other and
the other graphs as well so it gives you

652
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,280
kinda occlusion how to visualize higher
dimensional

653
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,760
high-dimensional processes

654
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,310
so we're this is a pro tip for machine
and which consume information

655
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:50,970
I'm machine out machine learning at you
know

656
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,710
many of these of these methods that you
have that amidst certain names least

657
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,800
where rich lasso

658
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,880
when canonical iced are nothing but you
know

659
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,040
some sort of a I know based approach
with different like the odds and prior

660
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,610
distributions so with but this means if
you don't

661
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,680
if this is not familiar with you it
means that your favorite machine

662
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,130
language

663
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,510
other num hones in on something in ways
something

664
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,800
you have to be aware what it holds a
knot in what ways

665
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,520
if you're not aware of that you are
kinda like you you kinda doin' blind

666
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,740
blind and houses if the constant for its
actually weigh and what's not

667
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,340
again domingo's will will in in in like
new

668
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,390
so attached to the stock is a short
white paper that I put in there

669
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,120
somewhere too

670
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,050
that up to a little bit about some of
the cyber research

671
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,640
com section are in the issues that work
with the

672
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,970
for which could benefit from such an
allowance

673
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,550
as a mention I was very happy that that
box on came out because I wrote this in

674
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:52,190
2011-2012 for a

675
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,160
deal the operators and I told them have
a look at this and I told him it will

676
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,580
take three years for this to come out

677
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,790
I was three to five years but the box on
came out a in

678
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,880
two years so they were fastened I was
than I thought it would be

679
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,330
so work many of the of the security
mechanisms that work for sequential

680
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,350
programming are

681
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,770
ineffective completely ineffective
actually instant concede tax

682
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,480
a you were this

683
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,820
so says this is coming on the horizon
most people are not

684
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,190
prepared for this in fact no one is
prepared for this but when someone will

685
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,960
have to start

686
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,930
thinking about about the fence
immigrants that worked against

687
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,050
multi-core attacks o'rourke currency
attacks that the that work with double

688
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:31,580
fetched

689
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,310
have their inbox on and I think that
first careful study of books on

690
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,450
interrupt the paper we

691
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,960
lil something set up to do that at

692
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,020
and cited have time to to to change
that's items

693
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,230
give to our talks before work you know
Singapore

694
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,300
that so another another ok

695
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,910
probably commit the competitors from
from such an analysis

696
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,580
is compositional security what does that
mean one of the one of the main

697
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,440
a areas a free search for a long time is
you have a components and

698
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,540
supposed to be secure with certain
properties yet another component

699
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,960
and what happens when they interact
together at this is one thing this is

700
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,950
one of the landmark

701
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,020
papers also the came out in 2011 a

702
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,150
best intuition since Thompson 94

703
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,870
reflection on Trustin Trustin little
trust anything for them right on

704
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,150
compiler didn't get the Sanford Civic on

705
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,510
turns out the many of these these
problems are undecidable for

706
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,150
patty all components that are out there
that because they are too powerful

707
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,740
their language recognizer a was not used
not restricted to context the

708
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,760
a free grammars or a regular expressions
it is too powerful it is

709
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,840
most of them are and the city you know
what two incompletes

710
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,050
but the nothing that even something as
that this

711
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:46,190
that recognizes nondeterministic a was
to not to matter is too strong

712
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,440
the server is the work of then Sassaman

713
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,770
may he rest in peace and said he brought
us and of course anna &

714
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:58,670
and and others and this is as so they
point to a minimal

715
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,100
computational power principal and such
an ass

716
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,850
what will help in fact in finding this
type of signatures when

717
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:11,200
when securities cannot be given as well

718
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,740
the the last point so I woke up one
morning

719
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,980
ants stock markets little

720
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,810
crashed fast cash 2010 then he gave this
explanation that there was a fasting a

721
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,580
traitor

722
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,130
said mean I mean eighty Americans

723
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,870
you know believe a lot of things but I
mean those a little bit too much for me

724
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,050
so I looked at some of the grass and it

725
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,420
was look very familiar to me it looked
like or wars

726
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,710
suffer you may know call was from Bell
absence on I said

727
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,990
decide this is machine induced I notice
machine just so I

728
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,110
idea do nothing about trading at all the
you know

729
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,490
I like to learn stuff so I called a
couple people I study the stuff

730
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,160
when I figured out what happened and I
wrote it up longer foot as he sees

731
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,590
report came out and why question happy a
as happy about that I was not wrong

732
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:59,290
the a I took all my money if the stock
market because the stock market nowadays

733
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,060
is wrecked

734
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:04,310
against investors but what my main point
is that there's a time machine

735
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,180
in algorithmic trading back stock
trading that is only dominated by

736
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,120
machines

737
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,780
a nynex has many of this class so it's
not normal trading this is Dez are

738
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,060
these are a high-frequency traders that
are bleeding institutional slower

739
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,110
investors

740
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,740
and the what happens is that

741
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,800
you cannot again one of the one of the
on

742
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,810
the results of of hymies autonomous
agents

743
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:30,010
a work in Agra is that there's no
security guarantees

744
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,000
can be given I on into and ends at the
dynamics

745
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,420
after in the aggregate what is left with
such channels well

746
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,890
there is a there is a guy at the at

747
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,170
ETH it'd see which serve a good
university in

748
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,450
that's what I want culture net and he
studied the stuff long time ago

749
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:50,980
have a 2003 docked at the Super
exponential

750
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,770
a predictors for a for stock market
crashes

751
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:58,210
and I'm thinking that that and I'm I'll

752
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,830
this is also on my nominations for best
sub security paper

753
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,570
but there were two to conservative the
selected

754
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,700
so what I'm thinking is that you can you
can use

755
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,750
Dez this detection techniques that I
didn't

756
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,330
there to find the SIR event signatures
in the face space in order to

757
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,380
a said you cannot predict any any any

758
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,490
a what will happen in the future what
you have to do is try to detect

759
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,820
certain a normal patterns before it
actually happens

760
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,500
before actually comes to a head if you
have a look at somebody had epilepsy

761
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,660
perhaps it up see if you put Eger to
your and

762
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,250
onto your a onto your brain the neurons
fire in sync

763
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,140
that's pathological behavior your heart
rate does not goal

764
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,990
regular pom-pom artists like your has to
be because if it weren t would

765
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,080
it will blow up your blood vessels so
you have so up

766
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,530
normal systems are designed since arnal

767
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,910
result system like the human beings are
designed in a way that you have

768
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:57,370
that you have certain face based
signatures that

769
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:00,600
the committee that that have certain
characteristics you can use

770
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,730
the state insight into Stability Assist
system order to detect

771
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,880
this type of a this type of build up a
pathological condition 13 trading

772
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,470
in order to circuit breakers and queso
the situation and rectifiers

773
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,580
the militants Singapore us once the
things I was discussing her a

774
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,790
they advanced year they have smart
cities a soon

775
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:22,460
are I liked him we'll see cities that
the will be a control %uh getting

776
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,620
controlled

777
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,070
you know summarized the the

778
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:30,900
solar cells were point what's the Sun
know we'll have energy and it's gonna be

779
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,760
a great vision if no one attacks

780
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,070
but even if no one attack citys the
system's are bound to a breakdown

781
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,640
or but we don't want to be in a
situation where some leaders no water

782
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,010
for for everybody or

783
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:44,290
for for you know for the in GR would
have you so we're

784
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,510
there's some good examples like portent
in organ United States have

785
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,920
that good initiatives bad when this
that's a Cisco ants

786
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,330
South Korea some some dough which to

787
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:58,190
is work difficult see so me I think it
would to be a

788
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,400
uses for that now Soham

789
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,560
your I'm at the end of my a presentation
I don't always do this kinda stuff else

790
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,190
have fun

791
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,950
like with the scraps so we're this is
from the John of reproducible results

792
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:13,310
it's not hard since get published in
eighty percent rejection rates and

793
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,970
your expression you know a you're
comparing apples with oranges

794
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,540
so this guy took no sunkist navel
oranges rehnquist Apple

795
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,050
ground into pellets per to a ten million
dollar spectrogram and printed this

796
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,230
artist the frequency spectrum I carried
it around for 10

797
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,560
an attorney eight years waiting for the
occasion someone say you're comparing

798
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,810
apples with oranges

799
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:35,880
and I would take up promptly and say no
I'm not but this is

800
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,190
and it never happens but I still like to
look at and think

801
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,530
on what could have been what could have
been
