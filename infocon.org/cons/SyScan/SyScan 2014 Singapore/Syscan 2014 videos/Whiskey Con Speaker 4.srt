1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:04,040
okay so this talk was given by me in a
million in Germany

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,950
and Thomas against to do some version
here so now you can expand

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,990
what we did in Germany in nicely what

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,510
how so agenda

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,560
which we have no nothing to show okay so

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,700
it's basically told that Marty and the
Ameren wrote

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,070
a regatta presented I'm not really sure
what the slides are here about

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,270
I'm gonna try I'm just do it a they
tried to buy

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,550
if I'm from ability to they want to
automate the process am

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,230
they have a really simple approach which
seems cool that'd

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,450
a so

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,020
the approach is basically to look at
poachers which are indifferent to listen

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,010
so if you have a patch in Windows 8 and
you have pets in Windows 7 you look at

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,100
the pictures on this if

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,290
something got patched so in this case we
see a

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,550
the in Windows AP parts there they added
the

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,840
your long mile and function and the
Windows 7 doesn't have it so

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,580
there could be something to chew over
over here and that's the same

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,040
occur we have nothing here to show so
that's the same code I'm not really sure

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,260
where my period so

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,340
is still here and they basically have a
set of functions which they try to look

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,710
and see if their European

23
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,830
in new patches or other ones and see if
they exist in

24
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,560
if they don't exist in the all the bros
and it might be a runnable arm

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,460
they're basically 131 that's right ok

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,090
and these are some of them take a look

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,409
it might be interesting so the approach
is basically tomb

28
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,970
picked up at shows to the compound
amusing I don't price them inside and

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,320
database and beef them

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,860
and if you see that some functions such
as a function without a

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,320
there might be someone ability if it
lacks in the other one

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,170
and now the interesting part

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,250
okay so this actually very interesting

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,000
it talks to do look it was a very nice
command line tool

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,189
everything was perfectly and then mayor
says

36
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:11,939
and when I like a goalie said a she want
to let you can make to know

37
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,829
so this would happen look

38
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:22,049
this is what they got to me a min
hightower's you have no clue how many

39
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:23,230
buttons daisies

40
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,200
and want to play fast I was shocked
immediately

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,189
so I came in here Emily this so
basically residue what's wrong with the

42
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,799
what's wrong with this so she's a guest
to change the corners

43
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:40,819
that was is the best solution and I was
like

44
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:45,239
XO Manowar not but

45
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,739
any she stifled 15 minutes to explain to
me

46
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,889
which put into place fast and she said
by documentation

47
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:59,569
shoot was the corners disaster

48
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:04,049
but how but there is on walks

49
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:08,189
so I actually the two looks she did a
very good job and you can see it now

50
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,529
how you can basically take any driver in
Windows seven eighths

51
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:15,099
and it give you a nice least and buy a
database

52
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:19,019
you can check what kind of signals and
Steph function with edit

53
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,849
in Windows 8 but we're missing in
Windows 7 and if you do these gifts

54
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,129
owning the Divas you can find someone
ability that you can exploit Windows

55
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:28,669
seven

56
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:32,919
but not going to say it so that was all
the talk about

57
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,260
thank you
