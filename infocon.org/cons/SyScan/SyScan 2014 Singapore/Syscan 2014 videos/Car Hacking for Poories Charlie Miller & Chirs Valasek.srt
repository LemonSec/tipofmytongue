1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,429
a once the scan we come whenever we can
and

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:06,770
will never speak it black and Asian
never true

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,429
I think there's a reason this this is
having the best speakers because

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:14,820
it shows that the all the real
researchers are really behind sis Canon

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,930
Thomas and we're all speaking here and
drop in an issue here sup

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,869
I hey I write applause for Thomas's can
cruise sponsors everyone thank you

7
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:28,859
in most parents is like we go to like
ours as we get lots of pics

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,610
but nine hours at a time we give our
talk and then we go hit the pool

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,690
but like today and tomorrow I respond a
lot I'm here because there's some

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,010
spiegel I miss that says a lot doing

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,190
so I S II guess let's get started so I
this is like a branded talk

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,960
a new research I last summer we did some

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,750
some research on car hacking and then
this is our the the second step above it

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,530
and we spent

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,690
I'll 6-9 months a quite some time

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,199
break break a lovely a and and we know
we understand the people sing for art

17
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:00,699
poor

18
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,770
that there's almost no one poor here
pepper United States has a lot of poor

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,229
people

20
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,159
so that's why the stock is is about it
are hacking for all those

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,530
or United States people I love driveway
a

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,280
says us the that's me

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,700
and that's charlie didn't want to be the
media are inside out the alternative was

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,220
the douchebags I

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,799
me or so I we're gonna talk about first
we'll quickly

26
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,810
I what it means to attack a car like a
specially

27
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,329
say remotely so week lot talk about that
so what exactly does that mean and then

28
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:33,900
we're gonna

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,780
I talk about a little bit by research
and finally we're gonna

30
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,229
move into you know we got cars darpa so
that the US government was still enough

31
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:42,720
to

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,119
give us ours but not everyone that lucky
so out how if you and yours in car

33
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,579
research how do you get started

34
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:51,630
you know without having to pay forty
thousand dollars if you just have

35
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,659
a couple thousand bucks can you buy
research and and

36
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,159
yes so that's what we have a white paper
we're gonna release here

37
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,670
and the slides all issues should be able
to get up and running and and do all

38
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,310
summer to

39
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,520
at car hardware for suffer people went
oh and I started this research

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,150
we really didn't know anything about
cars and change my oil

41
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,410
i dint touch the car other than to drive
it I am we learned a lot about cars but

42
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,950
we realize there's a lot of things

43
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,470
you know software hackers need to know
before they actually start

44
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,510
the automotive research look

45
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,970
you'll see the rest its you wanna talk
about the attacking

46
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,370
so you know a lot of people just assume
that you

47
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,519
pop car you pop the telematics fire you
know Bluetooth ur

48
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,140
or GSM or something like that but
there's kinda this multi

49
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,959
tiered fashion in which you would
compromise a vehicle to gain physical

50
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:42,800
control

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,989
the first is getting code execution I

52
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,000
I think that's becoming more and more
prevalent vehicles not only a Bluetooth

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,480
you have in car aP's right there's all
this collectivity cars have wifi

54
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,890
they're adding more and more remote
factors onto the vehicle

55
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,170
are gonna have app stores in them like
yeah

56
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,180
raising a whole app store because your
phone doesn't do that

57
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,090
I don't know right essay taxers is
getting bigger every year with cars at

58
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,900
and you even have kinda have

59
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,560
a localized remote attack vector this is
the thing I have a home

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,040
I it's fully karma right they run over
Bluetooth ur

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,780
or GSM CDMA you can plug it into their
DB to poor

62
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,950
and read a doubt and you know right data
in so you can

63
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,989
if you have a few quick seconds to his
back systems automobile

64
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,330
implied when these things and integrity
that accent we showed in our previous

65
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,069
research

66
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,680
right so it is at the gate code running
somewhere on the network inside the car

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,299
whether you

68
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:41,680
remotely pop it or whether you've
somehow plug something in early white

69
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,349
something in

70
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,250
as some at some point he code running
somewhere in the car the goal is to get

71
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,659
on the cars network and once on the cars
network what do you do

72
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,439
a you physically I you send can messages

73
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,870
on the wire well twisted pair wire
you'll see later to

74
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,500
and you either do kinda diagnostic
messages that a mechanic would use

75
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,110
or you find real message is that the car
users to do things like braking steering

76
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:11,220
exhilaration I'm you just want to inject
can message is basically once you're on

77
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,040
the network you wanna check and messages
to do stuff

78
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,350
anything about cannes is that there's no
way to tell whether the message is

79
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,229
coming from

80
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:22,770
no compromise issuer is you plugged in
or

81
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,500
anything or the release use its
broadcast there's no authentication

82
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,030
authorization so

83
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,889
they just consume messages they don't
ask where it came from is not even

84
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,070
source and destination addresses you
don't even know who sent it or response

85
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,930
to get

86
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,150
I you know what are things a lot of
people don't think about miles really

87
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,220
bad but there's a

88
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,250
gateway I a lot of the times to do so

89
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,030
can be yeah there can be a gateway I am
right so

90
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,050
if you pop telematics unit it doesn't
mean that you will be able to send

91
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,460
messages that all reach the steering
issue

92
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,440
it may go through some gateway system so
this is something you're gonna have to

93
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,910
bypasser subvert to reprogram or
something like that and that this is

94
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,169
just another concept

95
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,199
when you're compromising a vehicle so

96
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,940
a here's some different things you might
hope the mildew

97
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,130
and these are things that we daily some
%uh so

98
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,810
you can and some cars in some situations
you can get affect staring at the car

99
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,250
on this by saying cannisters you can
make brakes either

100
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,610
you lock up or not work there's a lot of
things you do you can make the car sorry

101
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,190
you could microphone our script as well
as lots of things

102
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,259
the the possibilities are like very wide
open once you actually get

103
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,680
the ability to inject him a citizen's us

104
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,110
so so here's a video other that we

105
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,190
we took this reporter out on the streets
of Pittsburgh

106
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,310
and the and showed us on the attack site
see if this

107
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,430
answer well if you can hear the sound
anyway Sony

108
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,500
so he's driving along and we'd we
totally crashed on of the road

109
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,199
and scared to put the the fear God and
his cameraman

110
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,330
but we just smashed into the side of the
road

111
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,330
so here here areas Sox ASA he can I knew
it was going on

112
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,440
but his cameraman had no idea so so this
is a must see

113
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,620
this this is like like Iraq is fine as
is not popping Cal

114
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,139
its you know crashing a car to the side
of the road so it was

115
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,370
I yeah I think so and i pop Kalka you
know enough times where

116
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,630
it lost all its PO and be just
physically wanna start hurting people

117
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,590
so so now when I get that when I want to
go back to the old days i jus

118
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,220
open up how that's ok I remember when
that was as a way this is this is a

119
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,569
free fine to do and dangers him I

120
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,539
carjackings hard the first reason it's
expensive

121
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:39,769
this is a

122
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:43,639
you know the bill for the Ford Escape
that we bout we've got this thing used

123
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,829
about it in 2013 the 2010 model

124
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:51,879
20,900 USD most people don't have that

125
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:57,449
the Toyota Prius even more expensive
almost 32,000 USD serait there yet

126
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,459
fifty thousand dollars in car even if
you work for a company it's hard ass for

127
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,319
research budget

128
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,729
fifty thousand dollars and ask you why
say I want to completely destroy a car

129
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,019
it's hard to justify that expense for a
lot of people right

130
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,329
but those aren't the only things you

131
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,589
gonna what car insurance I am it's funny
cause I have insurance agency as saying

132
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,269
like our consciences car

133
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:23,489
like what do you get for like recreation
is what you tell a bioassay easier for

134
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:24,329
recreation

135
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:28,479
I you may break your car in South Bend
Indiana

136
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,629
it gets towed it needs fixed that cost
the six thousand dollars

137
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:36,439
I registration there's a license plate
if and when one looks up

138
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,329
there look up %uh the Prius but
registration cost money insurance

139
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,459
there's a bunch of expenses with doing
this research it just ends up being

140
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:44,949
terribly expensive

141
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:48,459
right and so you when you want to get
started hacking and you wanna

142
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:52,749
act Adobe Reader Firefox free I give you
any move up in the world that you wanna

143
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:53,539
hack an iPhone

144
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,800
like 50 bucks right and so these are
things were used to pain and doing

145
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,529
research on

146
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:01,419
and you know if you wanna get a new copy
of IDA Pro maybe it's a couple thousand

147
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:01,899
bucks

148
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,179
something so so where you said that but
then like the princes way the hell down

149
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,839
here forty thousand dollars we can't

150
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:10,279
expect people a to to put other kinda
money in

151
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,559
I don't want to be driving a car that no
one's looking at because they can't

152
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,249
afford

153
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:18,889
paper yeah exactly an after we did the
first project we realize that a

154
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,239
we wanted to do another cyber fast-track
project obviously

155
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:26,709
and and be- we wanted to you lower the
barrier to entry for other stuff

156
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,079
we figure if you could forward a copy at
like IDA Pro

157
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,159
and a laptop I'll let that put you
around somewhere like

158
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,199
five grand I if we could move it to
where you could do Automotive Research

159
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:38,269
to that level

160
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:41,379
more and more of us could actually
starting to be surgeon said I have only

161
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:43,169
people who got grants from darpa

162
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,589
so that's a stock is is how do you

163
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:51,139
how do you do car research without
buying a car I am

164
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:55,689
lower the cost rate cars expensive we've
be seen that they're just pricey

165
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:58,860
you buy a used in there still very
pricey by and do

166
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,240
is even more expensive but there's
computers in those cars

167
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,429
and when we did the first kind of
project we had to buy replacement

168
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,279
computers a bunch

169
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,889
and we mostly got these %uh e-bay a
lotta times for a couple hundred dollars

170
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,370
so maybe if we could just start looking
at the computers used

171
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,709
I am we could isolate them and do
something with them right

172
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:21,970
and some us as researches okay so you
can buy one of the computers in the car

173
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,309
and if your car's gonna have maybe 20-30
these computers

174
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:29,420
see by when the zinc any wired up make
it work and then does is gone or just

175
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,309
like the car not what you have to do to
make it work his act like it's in the

176
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:33,040
car because

177
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,899
if Italy does have two things and maybe
center center accident weird way

178
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,519
want act exactly like it's in the cards
you can do research on it and

179
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,519
know that if you go get a car after that
it's gonna work dad this is

180
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,809
nice research you could do before you
say go by automobile

181
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:50,980
I lastly we need to you have kinda a
mobile platform we need something that

182
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,500
moves as locomotion

183
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,069
right and we needed to figure out a way
to provide the commotion which will show

184
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,100
you how we did that

185
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,000
very cost-effectively later in the
slight yelling at school about lowering

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,730
the cost

187
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,420
is even if you can afford a car on

188
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,350
its it's like if you're gonna attack you
know and image parser something you had

189
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,480
like 20 to pick from

190
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,000
and you can just sorta try them all find
the easy one love you just if you commit

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,009
to buying a car

192
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:20,439
maybe it's super secure in your like I
can spells my aunt arnica knack

193
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:24,350
so it's like if you could just try a
buncha cars you could find the easy one

194
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,939
to hack

195
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:28,709
and and so i cant aside by 10 cars you
can buy 10

196
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,730
issues one from each car and and look at
them you know briefly and see which ones

197
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,129
that we

198
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:36,429
that when we initially did the first
auto project we were totally

199
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:39,689
you know we're sweat it we bought all
these carp about fifty thousand dollars

200
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:40,730
for the cars &

201
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,990
if we could pull anything off what ya
report was gonna be like

202
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,269
we suck we can do anything right and it
was nerve-racking

203
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,910
you but if you if you do it this way
take some of the stress away

204
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,600
so appeared if you're like us

205
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,740
I require that is the hardest part so

206
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,220
I i mean there's some stuff that you'll
need to learn to do what we're talking

207
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,519
about but saw easy stuff

208
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,169
mostly espy no idea saying you'd like
there are some very very busy

209
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:06,949
electronics

210
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:11,059
on yet to figure out how can works which
is basically something that we talked

211
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:12,110
about it last

212
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,429
and when the important things is to

213
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:18,819
to get though the official wiring
diagrams in the manufacture because

214
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:19,579
those things are like

215
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:24,339
super helpful we we start it without
looking at and the wiring diagrams from

216
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:25,589
say Ford Toyota

217
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:28,449
and we thought was exhibiting understand
why they were yeah I did I think they

218
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:29,990
were just drunk some pictures today

219
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,620
as i got now I just figured out and you
realize that you start looking these

220
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,299
things and you realize that they have
the listing up

221
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:40,149
which pins are for can I am canewell
which pins for ground which pins

222
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:44,329
r4 power these are things that stupid
saw for people like Charlie and I didn't

223
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,419
really think about when we start the
project

224
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:50,360
now because we were thinking about early
like there's a network and as packets

225
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,380
and we're sending packets like we don't
really care about the hardware exactly

226
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,669
very

227
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:56,880
application where stuff is what we focus

228
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,290
acts let's talk briefly about can and
what you need to know these two

229
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,380
to do this project so up I we mention
some other

230
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,549
the things about can which are
everything broadcasters no sorta

231
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:08,910
authentication

232
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,169
there is no addressing on

233
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:15,620
but physically is is two wires and

234
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,209
you not only their there to a certain
like you see in the picture but

235
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:22,389
they don't mess I have to be on and then
the

236
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:25,529
do wires that are term and some point
viruses that's it

237
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,029
so that's that's can physically if you
want to

238
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,189
up make your own can network at home

239
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:35,579
this is what looks like 220 ohm
resistors

240
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,579
I you know I can I am can low

241
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,230
that's basically what I can network is
there if you have a little breadboard

242
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,290
some resistors and wires right

243
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,360
I am the other basics that if you look
at our research before we use these

244
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,669
things called econ cables and we had
them hooked up to a db2

245
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,819
but if you just leave the wires you know
exposed

246
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:58,880
and talked about the can hike and low it
works kinda have

247
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
judge us that just as it was in the car
you can sniff traffic of the

248
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,410
CAN bus and you can inject cash can
traffic as well with the library

249
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,049
released so the cool thing is

250
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:11,360
we've already written all this code for
you to do injection

251
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,389
and reading and manipulation writes the
same tools we talked about in our last

252
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:17,110
research in the same

253
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,720
you know same things to buy same same
software all this also works its just

254
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,329
now it's sitting on your

255
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:27,169
dead you know your desk incentive inside

256
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:30,949
I awesome ECU basics a you're gonna need
power

257
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:34,410
that patient be too surprising write
these things one of

258
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,509
a something called electricity which we
just discovered

259
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:41,199
during this project which is amazing and
you're gonna have to ground them

260
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,809
and they generally have one or more
pairs have can I Inc and low

261
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:49,539
it depends on what their function is in
the automobile

262
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:52,799
as we saw before cannes is twisted pair
wires

263
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,630
you know ones a can I ones can low

264
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,819
wiring diagrams your best friend these
really help you figure out

265
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:03,569
these after you know r56 ECU doing these

266
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,980
it went from taking a couple days to get
one figured out to

267
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,230
you know an hour to get it set up in
working on our on a testbench

268
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,389
writes a so this like this it talks
about the very first thing you try which

269
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:13,880
is

270
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,029
you buy an ECU from ebay or something
you plug in power and brown any plugin

271
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,100
can tank and lonely turned on

272
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,929
and sometimes it's going to be enough to
get started sometimes you get any more

273
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,569
stuff and busy the rest as research as
well as the more stuff to get the store

274
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:31,089
that's neat seeing can packets lobbies
you whether or not

275
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:34,299
it's working correctly or not you still
know what message is that specific

276
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,380
issues sending

277
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,860
which is hard to do in the car right
because everything's broadcaster nature

278
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,880
right so that's the first that as you
can at least figure out what the issue

279
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,000
is sending as opposed to see all the
traffic and you have no idea

280
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,679
what's anyway these are from Toyota's
website you signed up from a can

281
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,189
discount

282
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:53,139
at tias I what do you know they show you
the actual connectors they tell you

283
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:55,160
which ones are ground which ones are

284
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,610
power you know which ones are can hike
and low

285
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,850
I if you look at the other wiring
diagram

286
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,100
I E C this is that very simple one this
is the seat belt use you

287
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,620
I you know you see the ignition coming
in here in power those are those are

288
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,949
both power

289
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:14,399
I can hike and low and that these are
seat belt motors

290
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,779
and ground right this is very simple
this is the most

291
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:21,399
a simplistic one which we started with
because we want to start simple

292
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,600
but you see by release diagrams you get
set up outside cock

293
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,470
right so you can hear you can imagine
you you know exactly where you need to

294
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,899
set up you know any power

295
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,679
brown can and then you're gonna need
some wires that run to the sea butler's

296
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,829
and and supposedly the EC will turn this
motors on our offer

297
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:40,829
that way and then for some issues are
really like this is the simplicity

298
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:45,089
some some connectors are gonna have
maybe under 200

299
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:47,750
different connections to go into another
it's like the one that controls the

300
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,589
engine

301
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:53,059
Supercup yeah there's a lot to come
today once this is too simple

302
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:57,669
so Chris I mention this a little bit but
when the first things we want to do

303
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:00,779
was because we struggle so much with us
on the first project was trying to

304
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,130
figure out what

305
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,140
each issued what traffic each issue is
making

306
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,720
on the candy hearts alike there's all
these messages with no idea which ones

307
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,079
where we're from which

308
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,140
which ECU and you're trying to reverse
engineer what each message did was hard

309
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,089
you know idea

310
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,630
like where was God for example when we
wanted to figure out which messages were

311
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,809
used for steering

312
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:23,880
and we had our parallel park assist with
cars we would get out for hours on end

313
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,890
in parallel park the car in China Sea
which messages were changing

314
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,589
I if we were smarter we would have to
thank the ECU that was responsible for

315
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:31,679
parking the car out

316
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,740
and see which messages it omitted and we
would have had our answer in

317
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,600
a day instead of weeks yeah for example
the board the issue that sends out

318
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,620
messages to

319
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,819
to park the car set-up or messages
that's it out at like

320
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:47,289
hundreds that you normally see and
others orders only its obvious which one

321
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:47,689
it is

322
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:51,959
so once you if you need is done that to
start with %um euro solve the problem

323
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,569
me they wouldn't like he said it took
his weaker to figured out the whole way

324
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,730
which is looking through 200 messages

325
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,149
and see which one seemed to change with
the steering

326
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,699
sup yet the the first thing we decide to
do is make you think that we called can

327
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:07,519
bridge

328
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,519
basically we wanted to isolate necu but
in the car

329
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,929
and pass messages back and forth rights
we wanted a physically cut wires

330
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,279
said those wires in our computer and
then have the computer for those

331
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,179
messages back and forth to the actual
computer right

332
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:25,779
that way we would see what messages were
coming in and what messages were being

333
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:26,669
spit out

334
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:30,039
so we could isolate that incoming
traffic as opposed to

335
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:33,360
the outgoing traffic the way we site
right just like a switch I know

336
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,649
you know a normal network and except
then you can see which

337
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:39,620
which side of the you know which
interface the messages were coming from

338
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,399
you would know with

339
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:43,730
you know what the issues and the way we
did this is with

340
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,140
to econ cables one that went to you the
actual issue

341
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,179
and the other that went to the CAN bus
and they had this little

342
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:54,159
many can bust in between right this is
coming from the car this is the cars

343
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:54,909
network

344
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:58,309
going to decom cable there's the ECU

345
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:01,549
that went the can that work that went
another econ cable and they basically

346
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:04,010
just passed information back and forth

347
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,769
and we have a video kinda showing on how
a how this works

348
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:11,210
and we have Toyota Previa we got sound
with

349
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,710
have returned up not power on right now

350
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,330
be so there's no point II which means so
ABC es tu e kam cables want to go to the

351
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,390
road network and want to go to the ice a
ECU

352
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,640
and their stars on the car here between
the

353
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,679
progress right now it's not actually
Regina

354
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,390
the Seattle area that as a see that it
says check PCS system that means the

355
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,419
seats out PC is offline something's
wrong

356
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,600
we're not supporting the messages back
and forth their is not communicating

357
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,700
so if we turn the car off

358
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,659
and then start are can bridge

359
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,649
it's now working on both those is now is
gonna pass a message back

360
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:55,029
or blanking right now blink blink your
lights mean good things for us

361
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:58,309
on see that the creas

362
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,409
is turned on and if we wait for

363
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:05,250
the same amount of time before we won't
see any check

364
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,750
PCS air that's because the traffic from
the can-bus

365
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,120
which is that applied there is going to
econ cable

366
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,419
onto the PC PC is going to be concave
rate Kamil work lemme

367
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,919
sq I its cool rikers

368
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,190
are and bridge working there this is
really neat because you can isolate the

369
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,049
issue in a car why's that good

370
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:32,230
you don't have to worry about hooking up
all the sensors and actuators

371
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,360
and power and things like that writing
is could pick up a wires

372
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,100
and get this bridge working and you'll
be able to see what message is that

373
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,970
ECU spits out and what messages are is
it seeing on its portion

374
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:50,010
can network I am you can even nicely and
figure out which messes cares about by

375
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,360
only for 18+

376
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,740
to it some other messes and see if it's
still behaves like you you think

377
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,980
yeah you can also use our cam bridge to
manipulate traffic

378
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,210
you could change data values as it's
being sent out or received

379
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,399
so you could use it for really a a
plethora of things

380
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:08,669
soundly awesome it turns out it's kinda
stupid yak it kinda sucks pretty

381
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:11,750
this thing kinda fuckin sucks basically

382
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,240
it still requires a car right so that
doesn't lower

383
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,649
barry eventually you still need a car
for this thing I am

384
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:22,279
the e.com cable to PC did he come cable
is a

385
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,789
very slow and very CPU intensive

386
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:29,870
a laptop battery dies relatively quickly
by doing this which doesn't really give

387
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,320
you all that much time

388
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,860
right a scene so it is not really
practical we wanted to do it

389
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,850
to you you know start this this phase
this research and we realize that it is

390
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,289
kinda fucked sacked

391
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,480
I so the right way to do it is either
buy any securities you out completely

392
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,330
out the car

393
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,850
it working on your bench and then you
know what's going on and United on your

394
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,820
cold or hot car

395
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,399
at sitting outside in the cold we both
live in cold weather place in the united

396
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,519
states in the winter

397
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,230
but not fun sitting out in the heat
again the car doesn't have

398
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,059
AC on its broken again not all that fun

399
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,330
so I what you want to do is as as a
first tab

400
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,679
as you just get the ECU you buy it are
you you have one out

401
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,289
and you you you look at the power ground
and in the canyon

402
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:18,700
and you see what happens there's a turn
on do you see traffic

403
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,039
it's really sort of hard because if you
don't see traffic may be the issue

404
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,450
doesn't generate track

405
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,539
maybe you screwed up which is probably
actually the case there mayor

406
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:30,360
maybe it's depended on some sense in the
car taxi active itself as well

407
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,450
right cm in nineteen mad because it it's
missing something that you don't know or

408
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,269
that you have it

409
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:39,059
but onto yet so there's a lot of things
that could go wrong this basically looks

410
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:39,909
like sitting on your

411
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:43,769
and events if figure this is the seat
belt issue from the Toyota Prius you can

412
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,340
buy these online

413
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,260
I you know the hookups are going to the
seat belt murderers we have

414
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,600
power we have ground I can I can low

415
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,049
another power and generally if you turn
that thing on it spits out traffic you

416
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:58,679
could see it

417
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,919
which is that's pretty neat how do you
know these are working

418
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,980
I the easiest ones have up

419
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,799
audible or visual you know notes we
power this guy on

420
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,740
it that makes this clicking sound the
DVD is loading the screen turns on

421
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,130
I sweet this is awesome right these are
the easy ones because

422
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,850
you can physically see this thing turned
on sale this you know you have it

423
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,789
somewhat hooked up correctly right and
circling on this issue is if you wanted

424
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:27,929
the research

425
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,429
you know the Bluetooth stack the Toyota
you can do that right here from

426
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:35,289
you know your room and set up from been
on the car so it's like super can be you

427
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,510
call savage are to go deep and find when
these things for

428
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,210
less than a hundred dollars maybe a
couple hundred bucks and you can start

429
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,130
your

430
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,980
remote attack vector research without a
car right lineup tended these

431
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,419
and buying which one as the easy bugs
and then you maybe get that car

432
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,440
and then here is another video adjusts

433
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,279
watchdogs is the easy setup this is a it
has 12 connectors I only have power

434
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,830
and and can't do it but you can still
see even with that

435
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,860
doesn't work quite right but at least
works good enough that you can watch

436
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,230
travnik the soundtrack here I'm gonna
I'm gonna look

437
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,299
I'm gonna watch traffic coming from a
catholic they're gonna

438
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:16,659
power on the EC in mean

439
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:20,130
so there's traffic coming from its I can
see right there all the

440
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,639
this happens to be the module that
controls the steering the car so

441
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:27,010
I can see the poor messages that come
out at and

442
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,230
that's it's already have have know a lot
about you know the

443
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,570
the messages are coming this is how most
issues are there not there's going to be

444
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,419
no

445
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:38,940
audible indication or visual indication
that they're on and running

446
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,010
you're gonna have to hook up here econ
cable one can sniff the can-bus

447
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:47,330
and it its emitting can traffic that
means at least its power on and running

448
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,679
if it's not

449
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,950
maybe require something most likely ever
hooked up wrong but

450
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,220
this is just one other indicators that
these things are functional

451
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,340
I what's really neat though is if you
have say like a baseline capture from

452
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:00,889
the car

453
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,009
right you isolated and I D

454
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,389
you turn on the car in DC with the
traffic looks like again this is for the

455
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:08,519
seat belt issue

456
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:11,840
it's a very simple one in the car it
kinda has

457
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,749
are some big in saying hey I'm in the
car and that if everything's all good

458
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:18,859
which it is because the car was
functional at this point it sending

459
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,600
zeros

460
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,029
right well when we did the same test on
the bench without everything hooked up

461
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,440
I'm you see it said that the same begins
but this beacons different

462
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,509
which I think means I'll I don't have
all my stuff

463
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:33,830
and then you see is that at the Rose it
just sends one

464
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,059
thats meaning it's an error code right
in to give it much like

465
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:42,059
up a function call in programming
returning one or zero based on failure

466
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:45,639
this is just the meeting traffic saying
I've failed I don't work properly right

467
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:46,210
now

468
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,389
so again it's nice to have a baseline
capture from the car to compare to you

469
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:54,220
because then you can see if you use you
are on the bench is working just as it

470
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,629
would

471
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:58,509
in the car right and you can learn a lot
by just looking at the standings and

472
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:02,399
is now a UN unknown s before with this
bike was now you know it had something

473
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:03,450
to do with the status and

474
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,529
you can start to figure out by looking
at at at these more like which bites had

475
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:09,389
to do with sensor values and Alyssa

476
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:12,210
it really helps you figure out what
these messages are doing yet and it

477
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,200
seems like manufacturers have

478
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,049
very similar kinda air Cody in other
ECU's

479
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,820
I would see a bit flip where between
being in the car now the car in you

480
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,479
start to see the patterns for that
manufacture saying like

481
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:29,399
oh yeah the third byte is the status by
whether it's working properly I

482
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:32,999
after doing a bunch of these you can
learn a lot about them

483
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:36,879
XO so far we only hope that can and hour
and

484
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:40,320
like we said you so you have to be more
than that so here is

485
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,529
%uh the CBO the issue but now we've
added the

486
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:47,070
the actual motors that it accepts how to
get this to work

487
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,720
you at sensors and actuators her I

488
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,049
I thought you had a video here our

489
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:57,549
against nights later that's later

490
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,840
I got two years type so here's a sears
is a ISO like

491
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,960
your a lot of the issues will requires
you know sensors hooked up to it that's

492
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,769
what they do is a degree in values in a

493
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:11,850
they do stuff and again like to keep the
cost down you know this I want to buy

494
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,039
if you're in a bind every single piece
elektrax in the car

495
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,879
like the masses about the car so there's
a lot of ways you can kinda fake things

496
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:22,049
and so like in this particular issue

497
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,609
I'll you can't make the oil pressure

498
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:29,320
88 minor by our sensor by jazz it

499
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,429
the way works and you can read this in
the manual or further explains it like a

500
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:34,419
mind because

501
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:38,070
I'd I don't have the ground and that
apply to back into goes up so

502
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,379
saul does the censor what edges and some
it detects whether it's

503
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:45,720
its its wide to ground and so are you to
do you want to buy

504
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,029
oil pressure sensor and you know Sims
huge apparatus

505
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:52,779
take wired yeah I get a lot of this that
these can be forged his there's their

506
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,849
simple things it you know a lot of
switches in cars are they send

507
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:00,399
a voltage over this amount or less than
this matter pending if the button is

508
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:04,029
pressed work this thing is happening so
you can take a lot of these things

509
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:07,039
just by wiring stuff and I

510
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,590
again I don't know anything about
electronics but I knew I I just kept on

511
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,470
trying things things tend to work
sometimes

512
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,720
i am. I was on this one too there's a
the way that it

513
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,849
eggs at the fuels its and some someone
on a boat is not a liar and a pain when

514
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:20,759
he gets back

515
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,820
and knows how much fuel as if he
disagrees a ser it's happy

516
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,369
so you can you can get away without by
Licensor's because

517
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:30,539
a you can to speak yep one other

518
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:33,809
one other bigger hurdles for these
things though was

519
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:37,519
not only do they require sensors but
they were acquired interaction with

520
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,710
other issues in the car right again if
you add everything physically hooked up

521
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,999
exactly like the car

522
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:47,179
it is not receiving messages from the
other issues it's gonna know and it's

523
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:47,869
not gonna be happy

524
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:52,470
yeah you know that things depend on what
the what rpm is and a lot of times

525
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,139
that's not a wire

526
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,139
to a sensor that actually said as a
message over the can-bus

527
00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:00,830
so there's computers that are relying on
other computers to get

528
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,059
its information um how can you

529
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:09,229
you know make this work so you just you
can to simulate messages we

530
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:13,220
in we i I think we kinda had screwed up
because we call this can sing later

531
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,509
three thousand so in the year 3000

532
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:19,570
his killer really all when people are
using it but I think we

533
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,070
now we have like six or seven years to
that happens

534
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,340
I but this is it it's like 20 lines a
python

535
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,669
what it does it take to capture that you
got from a car

536
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:33,559
I and send that on the can-bus and what
you know when you send all this

537
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,539
information

538
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:37,739
and the issue is gonna say hey I'm
receiving the right

539
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:40,979
you know bits of information right so
you think about the issue

540
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:44,039
all I can tell like if you wanna know
whether things is in the car not

541
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:47,789
the only way it knows if it's in the car
is whether it as the connections to its

542
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:48,629
answers

543
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:52,039
as actuators and when I can read on the
campus and 7th a call that

544
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:55,379
it has no idea if it's in the cards
exactly

545
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:58,710
answer here's yeah here's the video it
%ah K

546
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:03,099
we have our phase 3 set up here and we
saw before how it was

547
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:06,649
the this is the CDC again there it was a
meeting the

548
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:11,590
the though the receiver loaders deaths I
could use as it almost took my thumb off

549
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,729
when I tried to

550
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:16,269
engage them once so I changed out little
tiny motors I didn't

551
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:19,989
cut my fingers of saddam and before

552
00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:22,999
it was not here setting out the right
information because

553
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:26,710
it wasn't right are but now we have our
can simulator

554
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,979
and if we can send seatbelt codes after
the issue thinks it's okay

555
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:34,379
than it will actually think it's in the
car because it's getting messages from

556
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:38,690
all the other computers which is the
sports traffic and weekend

557
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,519
engage the seat belt motors I just as we
did if you saw the video

558
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,020
in our first para party research drivers

559
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,310
this is the passenger side seat belt so
if you were to get

560
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,430
in an accident they wouldn't want to you

561
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,040
take the belt so you can see that the
murders on

562
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,550
so chris is sending messages on the cam
must sign the car that

563
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,520
it's getting in an accident so tight yes
that the seat belt ECU

564
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,000
do any please send us a message is
without taking all the rest it traffic

565
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,950
it didn't yet it knew something was
wrong so it doesn't operate so it seems

566
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,300
like

567
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,620
issues when there in a incorrect state
just cease to perform their actions

568
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,590
which isn't too surprising but if you a
couple the sensors

569
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,240
and forge traffic that thing thought it
was in the Toyota Prius

570
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,490
and would respond to messages
accordingly I heard that

571
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:32,250
videos is now a major motion picture it
is a major motion picture is funded by

572
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,450
Columbia House

573
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,730
opening in theaters August 2015 to go
check it out

574
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,940
as here's another issue and again you'll
see that it doesn't work and so you said

575
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,380
Ms

576
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,800
so on this is the incident a certain
disorders

577
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,800
house so just give up our first off and
you can

578
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,060
tell by looking at like all lights are
on and all status is like dash dash dash

579
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,890
miles ago search in: happy

580
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,070
then I start a fake by senate budget
traffic

581
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:02,940
on one of its can't has to Canada races
so now as much happier

582
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,140
I call the lights are good Sep a couple
and then

583
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,250
you know the the bottom Res see how it
even think that having

584
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,500
RPM's right there right thing sits in
the car and the car sites that I just

585
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:14,900
said

586
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,840
messages on the second can interface and
now it's totally happy so it has no I

587
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,930
it's not the card this point at

588
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,190
so if you can get these baseline
captures my car

589
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,330
I you can you can you know make these
things

590
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,220
think that they're in the car right and
so so you don't need a car anymore we do

591
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,360
is you need a car for like 20 minutes

592
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,310
savings by a car Zipcar Rep wanna do
something take a buncha captures

593
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,420
sir binds up on the internet and you're
going to get here's another one

594
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,580
this is %uh the power steering control
module from the Ford

595
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,000
so it still wired into the car on
because

596
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,950
the only way you can really see it
partially working as a tech to you can

597
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,990
see like right now

598
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,150
it should work but it's not there is no
parson assistant I

599
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:04,130
make network traffic and now the parsing
works

600
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:09,260
Anna I would drive a car I am you can
start adding more more MORE right

601
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,210
so this is my a workbench home this is a
large portion a Toyota Prius

602
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,010
that we ripped out to the car a seatbelt
ECU the whole pre collision system

603
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,420
parking assist power steering for

604
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,010
a for the the parking I am

605
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,620
sense a parking sensors their rear
backup backup to cameras so

606
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,670
you can start collecting all these
pieces and start formulating

607
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,750
a complete not a complete on a bill to a
large portion

608
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,160
%uh the automobile that you want to look
at if you wanna figure out how you would

609
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,670
say

610
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,710
attack steering or something that you
don't need the car really you need a car

611
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,020
you probably need a baseline catcher but
then

612
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,650
all these parts are relatively cheap if
you buy them used her from a South a

613
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,230
chart

614
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,480
right and the cool thing about like you
don't have to buy all these parts I give

615
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,320
you a link about steer you don't need to
see

616
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,610
issue but on that the cooling about the
more

617
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,430
issues you do at the less traffic get
the pic because now you got really easy

618
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,100
sucking a real issues and so

619
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,250
it's actually get simpler the more he
sees you you answer

620
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,470
and the reason we had if you go back one
Charlie the east here

621
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,320
us cuz we had these things called cyber
fast track now stands the head

622
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,770
had certain number says is easy to use
so we had to add these

623
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:22,010
to add digit star bank account so that's
all we had to do to get those working

624
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,660
a beer all night situations so here's
like it

625
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,280
I mean believing it becomes complicated
is the more he sees Adam are sorta like

626
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,880
wire spaghetti mass you get

627
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,530
this this and that being you know
disaster there's all the power up top

628
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:39,540
here's two different can that works
there's grounds there's can highs

629
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,560
there's cameras

630
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,360
it is than that being complicated have a
lot of wires I'm sure there's better

631
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,440
ways to do this

632
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,090
I like Josh or some other yeah I'm sure
got months is shaking his head over

633
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:48,420
there

634
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,730
radiates by a prior like oh my god I
can't believe that you guys did it that

635
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,000
way

636
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,930
but this is the way we did it work so
the bad thing is I one day like

637
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,670
your kid bumps a table and then
something starts working you're like aw

638
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,820
man whether what I had to do its bidding

639
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,290
10 hours a figure out which wire came
loose or you go to conference and drink

640
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,060
for a week straight you come back in
like what is all this shit

641
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,860
I don't know I don't know what day this
is anymore say at the blood like

642
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,570
everything and i restart from scratch

643
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,270
Chris's housekeeper comes in all that
goes to Sudoku wires out

644
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,780
to stop it wires all bundled up and I
saw a bag Barnett

645
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,050
at that happen the I layouts

646
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,470
the whole point of doing this research
is in such as wire stuff up it's a like

647
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,860
find out whether you can control things
and whether you got attacked the car

648
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,379
and like how it is how do the uses
bridge in like see can learn everything

649
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:34,429
you want to know

650
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,940
and we'll show you how some any tax that
we talked about last summer

651
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,460
you can do on the bench as well yet to
see all of our tax we really replicated

652
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,149
most them here on our bench

653
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:46,350
we are now at a couples yes and cost

654
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,100
a nervous world

655
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,089
I hear taunt will see the

656
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,500
into a cluster starts up but doesn't
else speed

657
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,490
and it's all that N like charlie is it
was kinda have

658
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,110
you know it wasn't getting the right
messages from there are getting our

659
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,740
traffic

660
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:09,130
I so what we did is pick up a bunch of
the season sensors simulate traffic

661
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,570
an hour most everything that didn't have
a physical liar

662
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,970
on was happy love thinks the hybrid
systems okay

663
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,690
it says we're going to the amount of
ours as we're in part thing I like so

664
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,390
sets be the car evidence espy the car as
well so if you wanna do

665
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,170
instrument cluster attacks I you don't
outside really need the car you can buy

666
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,820
these parts set him up on the bench

667
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,530
and you know figure out your tax and
maybe if they're not possible

668
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,760
get different pieces for different car
before spending

669
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,850
fifty thousand dollars say here's
basically the same thing on the board

670
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,530
you you can still the yet so

671
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,230
you can set the speed like you know so
you know

672
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,480
you know what messages and you know
works and so that if you just happen

673
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,110
someone's car

674
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,600
you know it's work you can

675
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,230
even do things I like we can link it
says

676
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,540
as a series steering it is it the
steering right that serious if you're

677
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,560
going off the road

678
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,000
it would recognize that you're going off
the road and turn the steering wheel for

679
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,750
you now

680
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,190
week and I'm steel we can figure out
what those messages are

681
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:12,990
get this all set up on the bench and
start trying messages to you

682
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:17,120
get the steering to work I was having a
hard time pressing the buttons here but

683
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,890
you'll see this slowly start to you

684
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,810
a jerk left right and then that's the
steering

685
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,240
I love the the Prius you can do

686
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,320
attacks that we did that you saw last
year but

687
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,330
with out physically having the car
rights we get done all the research in

688
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,100
last year

689
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:38,100
on the bench and insects is verified or
so here's same thing for Ford

690
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:43,640
while

691
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,940
amazing it sound like a month really
impress

692
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,720
cell that beeping noise was actually the
back sensors

693
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,360
so it ike's so we'll but she sees hears
and clean the sensor so no

694
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,600
thought the guy was a reverse its sense
me like

695
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,110
obviously it was gonna run the orgasm in
my house but so

696
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,180
as a here's another one again back up
camera in such as you can see all this

697
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,900
up working

698
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,010
this is a little bit over giveaway on
what we're talking about a minute but

699
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,690
you can see

700
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,740
that it's obviously not a car and

701
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,890
I said oh my god there's a child back
there I use my children

702
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:23,310
test subjects he could have very easily
use the car loan or a box for the asses

703
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,230
child to stand behind this

704
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,820
I mean where they good for her daughter
the

705
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,830
they get helped the security research I
don't know what a good for

706
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,190
so if you're if you're not why I don't
pay child support

707
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:38,760
and as I hey wanna help me do some car
research

708
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,800
stand here Sat I anyway so you gotta
start to learn things about like the way

709
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,640
the sensors work so here is the

710
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,650
a wheel sensor from the Ford and you can
figure out like

711
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,320
as a sensor there's a thing and you can
see that's working it's exactly which

712
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,780
pack

713
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,820
are which bites and MS is are

714
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,280
the the easy reporting the speed at the
wheel so here's

715
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,910
%uh I'm going to show in a very slow and
Italian fashion

716
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,030
and here's the messages going across
that you see you sending

717
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,650
that is has been that love is a model
and you'll see that the sub changing

718
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,910
so you can you decide to figure out
exactly which bites

719
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,320
had to do with that particular sensor
what the values mean

720
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,720
you know what normal values are that
kinda stuff without ever having take to

721
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,180
get to

722
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,010
and this is really even though it is
simplistic one

723
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,040
their first kinda feat that you have to
overcome

724
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,970
is what messages what ID's are
associated with what issue

725
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,450
and then you have to say associate the
Apple

726
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,640
actual bites right up data and a lot of
the time

727
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,410
for us in the original research it was
guesswork like I assume that these to

728
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,630
buy to the tire speed

729
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:49,430
but with doing it this time around this
bite seem to change site yeah I P this

730
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,220
the something but by doing the way
Charlie did here you can verify that oh

731
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:53,680
yeh

732
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,040
this these two bites are associated with
this sensor and this is the speed

733
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,500
by you know for a fact and like at our
research last I knew that

734
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,760
there's 8 eight bytes and I knew that
they were you know every two was a wheel

735
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,820
I don't know which we'll and so I
actually tore it apart and ms

736
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:12,220
so that we are to show you can start a
message entertainment systems

737
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,910
and and this is just more a video I love
joined the table tennis system actually

738
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,560
works completely it has

739
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,170
GPS to the radio James Brown

740
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,380
satellite radio I acres and is Ron other
side

741
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,130
anyway and and you can you get and blue
to pay your phone with it you can you

742
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:29,730
ever

743
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,850
and you can you I research area inside
your house I think

744
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,530
this peace up equipment is the most
interesting alone

745
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,520
because if you want to remotely
compromise a car you're probably gonna

746
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,280
start

747
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,980
with infotainment system that has
Bluetooth telematics maybe wifi

748
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,120
USB something like that so you're doing
this type

749
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,200
research literally right here is is by
where you wanna start when you're

750
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,620
starting to do the automotive research

751
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,400
axo its awesome then great but there's
some things that you can't necessarily

752
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,900
do

753
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,650
and on on your bench on your workbench
that you could do in a car so like

754
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:07,340
here is an example: attack we did where
in the for the brakes and work anymore

755
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,940
and this is the one that may be crashed
my garage if you've been following me

756
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,410
and

757
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:15,080
so a if you have your your you're a BSM
on your bench

758
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,360
and you run the attack like you know
something happen you don't mess and I

759
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,170
know that you have crashed a car

760
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,520
so you learn something but you're gonna
have to actually get a car to figure out

761
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,080
what's going on so here's Ryan the same
exact attack

762
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,220
against breaks so if you like had
another selection happens I did but it

763
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,650
starts but not always like

764
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,700
oil crap all over my Electronix

765
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,680
I'll and so like I knew like a I really
did something

766
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,410
but I didn't know that that would really
how it would affect the actual

767
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,540
you knew that that was the breaking
because this was a tacky performed in

768
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,040
the car but if you went the other way
around I would say

769
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,410
something happened to that spitting
fluid all over my Electronix but I don't

770
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,320
know that that's actually breaks out
working

771
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,020
right so so you're gonna have to still
do some things I'd you have to verify

772
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,330
rokahr

773
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:03,360
but silly side I figured out exactly
what message does something to the

774
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,890
brakes

775
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,920
and you go so far as to actually get an
obd2 connection to your

776
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,250
your your bench network and plug in real
like mechanics tools and you can start

777
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,000
the chat and castles do

778
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,110
you can reverse engineer with the bank
cancels again which is how we figured

779
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,680
out

780
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,450
like that the crypto keys and stuff like
that you can do that on the bench as

781
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,050
well

782
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:27,550
so here is a the bench years that's the
Ford mechanics tool

783
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,810
and here under showing that it's
actually wire been working in

784
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,340
its gonna a very good video because
hours grapes are

785
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,820
just great yep so you can see this
number change in on the right because

786
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,480
its its measuring something in the car

787
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,240
and that blurry thing is getting change
you can tell it's different

788
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,180
can tell the actual value but you could
tell that it it seems anyway the point

789
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,850
is making schools work

790
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,960
on on them on the bench as well and
that's where we learned a lot

791
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,260
yeah in their original tax we learn not
only how to do a lot of attacks but

792
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,120
definitely had a defeat the security
access crypto key thing with mechanics

793
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,910
tools so

794
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,260
again if you want to start paying out
all the crypto keys for all these issues

795
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,730
manufactures

796
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,700
don't need to buy a car you to see the
mechanics tools then an ECU

797
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,110
I so working on the benches is pretty
cool because

798
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,930
like we said before you can save a lot
of time with you you can use it Eisley

799
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,530
issues if you got which candidate which
which will help you figure out what the

800
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,700
message is due

801
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,900
said it the way we did it which is very
slow on

802
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,830
you can you can do things like that
you're out the sry access keys

803
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,630
by playing them cancel you can start to
like play around

804
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,670
without worrying about crashing so I
want things we would do early size to do

805
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,830
is a I would record a bunch traffickers
say like

806
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,190
me drivin ends Craig craze stairwell sup

807
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,470
and then I was good ride on the highway
and I would replace the traffic

808
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,570
and probably nothing was gonna happen

809
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,600
but there's a chance at a time I would
just crash and so

810
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,740
I ideally you have a better way to do it
yes

811
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,170
safer as the kids say yeah I would do
the same thing I would you know capture

812
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,570
the car breaking

813
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:07,250
and then I just are driving around the
city in playing it the car would stop at

814
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,580
a bit like go around

815
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,780
let's go around as also stop are so you
can do all this tablet being a bit safer

816
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,090
and and not

817
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,730
you know maybe killing someone right in
my defense like a purse I try going

818
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:18,550
really slow

819
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,900
and then it didn't work and that I love
pass as a captain I just got the highway

820
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,370
so I anyway but it's much safer if you
and I and the really cool thing

821
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,340
remote attacker actors right yeah it's
going to be easy to get the thing up and

822
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,360
running as you can see some visual

823
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,040
I had a reputation that it's on but then
you can start

824
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,830
you now get your humor tooth one out
start fussing start doing something

825
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:43,270
and it's a good place to start for the
promote research for share

826
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:46,760
I but it's not perfect so you definitely
are gonna need to get

827
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,280
a base I in traffic from actual car
otherwise is

828
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,430
gonna be too difficult on everything is
very mention

829
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,950
that you know there's a jazzy maybe some
sensors it needs that you're not gonna

830
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:57,830
really want to get out

831
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:01,770
art is too hard or yen by so there's
gonna be some problems me looking some

832
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:02,710
stuff up

833
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:06,130
their thing is it's gonna be hard we we
met with the brakes I don't know if

834
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:09,800
if my break attack really affects a
break since I tried in a real car

835
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,950
but the the way we figured out breaks
was II went behind my neighbor's house

836
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,500
and I got

837
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,890
for big trash cans and I went back up
the pre s ever go

838
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:21,640
and just smashed through the trash cans
and record the traffic that happen

839
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,630
it's hard to do that with the bench
because the bench can't smash the trash

840
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:25,510
cans

841
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:28,700
right so there's some things like it
would be a nice if if you can make your

842
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,410
bench mu

843
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:33,050
as I was what we did next and NN this is
something I just did the other dates the

844
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,320
PRU dollars that works

845
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,630
has ordered a random issue for GM some
car I've never looked at

846
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:43,000
ordered it plugged it in it all works I
can see like i connect my phone over

847
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,790
Bluetooth to it so I can start

848
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,130
examine their my tax services this %uh
you know a particular car

849
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:52,240
and the same cost like to your inbox and
he called me and I didn't answer I call

850
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,710
him on this actual

851
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:57,090
you know through this bone as a a tiny
from %uh GM

852
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,470
as like voicemail Tigers jerk

853
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:04,280
an accident happened I'm so the next up
was

854
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,310
other two reasons to do this to one was
it because it would be cool to see if we

855
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,180
get some movement involved and get some
real peace is like inside a

856
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,420
making the you you guys were impressed

857
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,860
it and we had that thing on the bed to
move the stairs yeah I was really

858
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,630
impressed when I did that but obviously

859
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,760
united with Israel I will maybe we can
put it in something like a car and then

860
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,700
it would turn something up like a
steering wheel

861
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,240
and then you would be more are so it
would just be like badass

862
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,850
from yeah I and our answer was go karts

863
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:35,650
right right so the we you know we'd we
figure if the government is going to buy

864
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,960
its cars may be there by its like go
karts and

865
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,310
others things like that the United
States government its religious hissing

866
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,200
away their money on research

867
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,980
yeah so %uh yeah we we tried as much as
possible not actually call these go

868
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,960
karts but like

869
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,380
mobile platform testers are something
there nice fancy government names they

870
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,230
would give us the money

871
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:57,550
rights Center issued by companies like
super rad go karts

872
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,050
and then we just started attaching all
the issues to it

873
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,650
and wired up so this is very much like
the workbench

874
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,940
NEC this seat belts are safe they attach
a zip ties here

875
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,100
duct tape on the front occur that keeps
everything together

876
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,150
then wire to the back so now we have the
bench but on something that newt's

877
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,390
rights and you decided to start sensors
and a

878
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,590
you know attacks answer to something and
news and and maybe

879
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,430
you figure out that the break attack
really would that work and it's still

880
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:24,950
reasonably

881
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,200
cheap like the go carts were like two
thousand US dollars

882
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,660
right and then you have the most
sophisticated go kart

883
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,310
in the war that is true I'm pretty sure
we do our own to those

884
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:38,670
I'm not sure which is more sophisticated
but you can see that sort of the jumble

885
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,820
wires and like

886
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,840
so the findings is like on the front to
cart just like he can people strapped

887
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,380
I ago are this is SAE certified United
States

888
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:52,520
all this will pass inspection every
14:48 at fifty states

889
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,910
and I backed this thing up right up to
my child but

890
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,470
a here's a video maybe yeah yapping

891
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:03,600
okay so here's the occurred

892
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,570
the NC we have this with as a standard
fittings and the

893
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,990
I yeah bro how joke and that was
terrible

894
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:14,520
we have our main keep their goes my
house just me work

895
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,330
even if they were never any concern the
front tonight as you testing

896
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:22,970
pure things like preclusion system on
this go karts is it got the sense he get

897
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:26,750
little drivers in the trash cans lucky
to snag a networking issue in traffic

898
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,890
damages evacuee the creases steering
column

899
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:34,540
i right now it won't fit because neither
driver tits 3s

900
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,850
I got to steering wheels Nisbet and
eventually come

901
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:42,540
but this may be if that's possible you
see the seat belts are securely fastened

902
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,690
with that time up because this is not
designed

903
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:49,980
I'm just tired of this out there that
suicide is a and I'll keep ruining my

904
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,220
own jokes here

905
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:55,380
II then you had the can that work in the
back you know that but this is the same

906
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,910
thing we had the bench but

907
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,150
wired up to you a go-kart why you may
ask

908
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:04,170
because we wanna go karts yeah and
someone would buy ask ok I guess

909
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:07,510
its I was gonna paper myself honestly
right so I

910
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,440
so we Daily Record up his as closer to
actual car as a good so there are

911
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,330
multiple can networks isolated by some
gay wear something we actually did that

912
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:18,450
ennui we as much sensors as possible on

913
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:22,330
you know actuators when when possible
and when I think he knows there is

914
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,920
a the go karts had a little trouble
battery but it was enough to power all

915
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,200
was designed actually desire you know
the whole 10 DC

916
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,800
yeah right so I was made to start the go
kart up our budget is so we had to buy a

917
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,540
car battery

918
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,040
right on ever my go-kart was like wat
Chris's

919
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,050
yeah I was ahead as actual power
steering

920
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:44,210
their on because I i don't have to stay
where they have won and

921
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,930
it has navigation satellite radio

922
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:51,640
rear view camera let me do this for easy
to add to your cell aside

923
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,660
ON them anyway michael kors pretty
badass

924
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:58,990
it was it was pretty badass so that the
cool thing is a a

925
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,640
you know so you can actually do some
ability to see you can see just so you

926
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,480
can make steel actually turn maybe

927
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,100
you know by the way are you can use this
if you're doing trying to get research

928
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,480
funding from your company or someone

929
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,580
caught mobility testing and set up by me
a go-kart that'll work much better than

930
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,600
buy me a go-kart

931
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,270
right and and like we said it was just
fun

932
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:22,390
wireless thing sucked and it really dead
yes but not actually

933
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:25,630
everything about his go cart was just
awful I

934
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:29,830
yeah a week to build yeah it literally
took forever to build on their income

935
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:30,720
assembled

936
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,750
a shockingly car parts did not fit on
the go kart

937
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,530
wesat not something we thought about we
bought them weirdest eager to spend our

938
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:39,550
pets money

939
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:43,080
there that we should about this thing
there's some Mike open source car that

940
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,960
is very car ass gets around

941
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,420
a little bit more expensive than the go
cart but has like real steering columns

942
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,260
and shared like

943
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,800
its what would a been a way better
decision if we wanted an answer research

944
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,980
into this we

945
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,750
would have bought this is having a card
too much it was like on the sign in as a

946
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:02,010
well it's gutsy I'll it's gonna be good
I like those pilots get the same van

947
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,140
yeah I am for civil I is things are fun

948
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,760
you can say go out your neighborhood and
driving around in traffic that is

949
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,400
totally legal in the United States

950
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,630
enough now but we don't get in trouble

951
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,910
and it bears bears the corpse of
everything that was bought out over the

952
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,530
pre is right there

953
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:25,160
they don't worry I look both ways before
up on the street has become crazy

954
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,040
likely Chris lives right next to a very
safe place to test study

955
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,720
its history my neighbors love this cuz i
be running his go cart around the

956
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,310
streets yeah like five times a day

957
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:38,670
and since I work for a living like Press
I can I do my research and nights about

958
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:42,690
neier tag back in it. be like her drive
to see my go-kart

959
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:47,010
ICC has some off-road capabilities as
well and that duct tape to help I don't

960
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,100
know if you saw their air

961
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,580
held on just fine I mean there's a
little wiggle to it but that's what you

962
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,500
want

963
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,750
with

964
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:02,010
I so here's my virgin the the emergency
looks like this is in day time to

965
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:05,230
you should've been working for dessert
as the weekend a share a nice

966
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:09,480
I i don't have to do on the weekends up
lol I Chris as you can actually go for

967
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,290
bombs without all the electronics on a
par

968
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:15,480
I didn't actually buy name brand duct
tape I want to the dollar store but that

969
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,840
cheap duct tape that's why

970
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,720
so here is the same steering attack that
reason our and on the banks

971
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,350
this time you'll be way more us because
it's actually

972
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,650
and first said and is

973
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,710
here uses

974
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:34,420
yeah

975
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:37,920
others battered not rape all has a
really have parted clap

976
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,580
either the think the no on this though
is this is something that we didn't

977
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,770
realize in the car

978
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,570
I didn't have to have the angle sensor I
just had the steering column

979
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,970
and I use lane keep this is packets
which if you had our paper be four are

980
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:52,910
limited to a couple degrees but you saw
the steering wheel turned

981
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:57,240
multiple rotations right is because the
angle sensor I was faking

982
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,350
was always at straight ahead at zero
right

983
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:03,970
see you could probably use you what we
learn something we have to use a linky

984
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,010
persist attack

985
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:08,150
in the pre is by forging the steering
wheel angle as well

986
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,120
so you can have will come up on these
things when you're missing sensors and

987
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,910
you realize that you may be able to

988
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:16,420
a develop a new attack as well right you
get a lot better idea what the sensors

989
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,090
doing your

990
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,390
you're like getting dirty so here's one
more thing

991
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:24,220
up it's actually rigged up the
speedometer work to my go-kart once

992
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,150
again

993
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:28,400
agreements here engineering and I'll
sector I

994
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,640
so the way it is I put that Syrians are
that wheel sensor I put on the go kart

995
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,850
and I i like take some stuff and it all
works out so sorry

996
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:39,340
seal see it here diving that this I
might make it is

997
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:45,980
they came basically a bomb TC as I speed
up the speedometer actually

998
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:50,130
so you can do the actual same as being
either attack against No

999
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,500
work spam so you can see a good night

1000
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,170
housed be and that go kart sounds like
it is about

1001
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,010
ballpark now that says how it how you
want to

1002
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:04,340
back to you what this week like that and
it was working right maybe look at the

1003
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,550
bright theirs is like bar the safety
roll cage bars name attached is being

1004
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,820
second

1005
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,950
sigh so this number actually worked as
you could do

1006
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:17,450
that I can you set the speed but you
could set the speed and show how you had

1007
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:18,830
the fight against the real

1008
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:23,430
like packets that are setting this
there's a lot of pitfalls all it's

1009
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,560
obviously we just

1010
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,420
all this was like 99 percent Fallon yeah
it took us a long time to

1011
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,830
a get these things working one might
take us long to get the stock together

1012
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,600
because there's mostly failure

1013
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,110
dag that's hard to get any sorry success
I it really was

1014
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,810
and where and when copying like if we
had someone you know anything about cars

1015
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:43,150
are electronics ensure went very
smoothly

1016
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:46,490
an as you know anything about
electronics and

1017
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:50,080
a car tax like web browser exploit
developers it that's exactly

1018
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,640
petrol you want to do this type of work
that thanks darpa

1019
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:58,740
I really you're not gonna we found that
you can't really ruin the ZZ use a

1020
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,020
lecture reflashing them

1021
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:04,540
a lot of times I panic and be like oh my
god I burnt these you out by hooking a

1022
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:08,420
wrong wire up an A in all reality you
know I just knocked a wire out it wasn't

1023
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:08,950
working

1024
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:12,760
we found a quite resilient I you know
you can have power up that independent

1025
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,320
as early

1026
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,600
blow-up arm so if you think that your
router issue

1027
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,260
a triple check your wiring I call
Charlie all the time liked it doesn't

1028
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:20,730
work anymore

1029
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:24,470
evidence and his bro Brokers Group what
I got this you order a new one

1030
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:28,180
I did order a new one costs thousand
dollars about not us but someone

1031
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:31,850
a thousand dollars I because I thought
it was broken in all reality

1032
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:36,740
wire was loose although I burnout
alligator clip though the that a wire

1033
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,420
broke

1034
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,010
itself the point is you're not gonna
ruin the issues a very tough

1035
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:44,270
they may send okay message is everything
they look okay

1036
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:47,820
up but it's not these are just things
you can have to figure out

1037
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:51,400
a Catholic sensors up you have to do a
lot of debugging troubleshooting

1038
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,490
wiring I

1039
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:58,500
as you see this is very easy to
understand very easy to debug right

1040
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,920
system S I'm sure there's better ways to
do this but we're idiots

1041
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,200
and when something is wrong it's it's
it's so hard to know where to start to

1042
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,980
figure out what's wrong

1043
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:09,470
so when the weather is he doesn't work
anymore are looking at this doesn't

1044
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:10,370
really help you out

1045
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:13,490
and I wasn't smart enough to take notes
or label anything

1046
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:17,690
soho I as just a disaster same air so
like

1047
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,820
all the sudden one day something so it's
working and this is where you had to

1048
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,140
start

1049
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,140
you come down your bench after being
away for a week in like comments on the

1050
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:24,840
network

1051
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,860
%uh right there it is right that's the
young now

1052
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,870
it's just a rack why did I mention
wiring

1053
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,550
you should probably check your wiring an
alligator clip came loose and as I go

1054
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:36,660
kart doesn't work anymore

1055
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,980
I broke it nope alligator painless you
know so

1056
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,510
panic a lot so I think we'd we

1057
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,470
we accomplish what we set out to do
which is to make I research

1058
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,090
affordable so this is like some in the
prices are what you see is cause I told

1059
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:51,610
you I but

1060
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:54,630
is GM a head unit for couple in a box

1061
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,840
some of these other 10 to 100 bucks for
the

1062
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,380
to educate role model 150 fifty dollars
the new ones

1063
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,300
course as mark on that but i think im
use this is the one you by when you're

1064
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,440
panicked any wanna be your last
milestone

1065
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,530
right there at a cost 1100 bucks now
it's in a box and

1066
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:15,250
she has said in a box it out

1067
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,900
this is a perfect but we really wanted
to lower the bar we wanted people to

1068
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,290
start looking at the issues the key
issues security

1069
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:24,650
and I think with these give you a
blueprint on what to do

1070
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:28,150
right so in a perfect world you have ten
vehicles and you can test them a tear

1071
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:28,670
them apart

1072
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:32,130
are you you want but in the real world
dull so this is the bus

1073
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:36,150
the second busing I think the real
lesson to learn from this story is

1074
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:40,720
darpa bodice two cars and to go karts

1075
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,270
and that equals suck it rock I

1076
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:47,720
you know we got the cars and the go
karts you got nothin so sweet

1077
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,100
is sleep in his life I can hear and drug
was it was

1078
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:55,130
well as he tweeted about like when darpa
had this ad what would you call it a

1079
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:59,040
very much much blue car and Charlie are
chuckling because we gotta approval far

1080
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,610
surpass track already couldn't wait to
rub his face it

1081
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:06,230
it was a lot it was he was graves best
thing ever that's it for us

1082
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:09,310
anti-gang a chance I also thank you for

1083
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:12,430
waking up early come in the TOC thanks
Thomas thanks everyone

1084
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:15,740
really appreciate it thank you much for
this informative and entertaining

1085
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,800
presentation

1086
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,790
I was wanting the softer framework in
which injected the second message is

1087
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:21,990
that available will

1088
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:25,150
yes yes we release at on I don't have
the

1089
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:30,160
the site you know the exact name search
if you search car hacking the content

1090
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,140
the first things going to be I'll actors
block in it has the link to the exit now

1091
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:39,100
our stuff yes we we have a white paper
it's like 100 some pages and also the

1092
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:39,810
tools

1093
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:43,360
the the scripts all the free markets all
there so

1094
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,630
just google far so you can find it send
as email or tweet us

1095
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:50,550
and we'll make sure yet so when you
changing the speedometers like is

1096
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,340
actually going to affect the
exhilaration

1097
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:57,120
the card will make it actually go faster
takers a dish owners displaying the

1098
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,230
the change the speed so what we show
there was showing it but we were able to

1099
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,280
effect

1100
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,760
and the Taylor yeah in a Toyota you
could send

1101
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,610
can messages that would actually affect
acceleration in the videos it was just

1102
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,140
change the speed but you could

1103
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,180
perform the same attack by you know you
when actually accelerating the bench

1104
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,660
country could work something up

1105
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,000
solid for this to set the speed

1106
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,240
under its banner want actually affect
this

1107
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,290
the best way to kill someone the car to
Toyota Prius incorrect

1108
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:29,560
I yeah research on her side as only yes
cool

1109
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,490
it might not be the his car to hack but
it's the only one that has fully

1110
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:33,020
published

1111
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:37,330
exploits available so and now you spend
all this money

1112
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:41,180
a you the reason the American have
health care

1113
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:45,070
I Jesus Christ once said what the pores
what health care

1114
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:49,550
shut it all down than we did that United
States that's my answer that

1115
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:53,240
I will say that the United States is
known for cutting-edge research and

1116
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:53,830
we're just

1117
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,880
already nine re able to do anything with

1118
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,730
microphone am in this setup I don't we
ever mess with the microphone

1119
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:05,950
its its possible I would guess yeah I
mean every day

1120
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:09,170
so I we should say so other researchers
before us who did some

1121
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,370
some summaries are they did turn on the
microphone and listen

1122
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:17,380
listen to caffeinated remotely as well
so it's certainly possible we did

1123
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:21,170
how uses is it too blind to remove
messages while you are in flight which

1124
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,140
has changed him

1125
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:26,330
to send some wrong values and stuff like
that how how hard is it

1126
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:31,080
so us its it's super easy to send
messages you can't

1127
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,360
intercept and change messages on but
what you with the way our taxes work by

1128
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,530
saying the speed

1129
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,580
the car is sets any messes all the time
to set the speedometer

1130
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:43,140
I'm so we sent messages said to a
different value and the reason that it

1131
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,230
takes I value over theirs as we send and
much faster

1132
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:49,320
so to get passing it just tossing

1133
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,570
yes yes we just we flood the network
with with the message we want

1134
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:56,090
and ignores them the message that are
there already you can overwhelm

1135
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:59,080
existing masses but you can't change
that they're still there the purple or

1136
00:59:59,080 --> 00:59:59,870
the Canada trip

1137
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,890
ready similar for %uh the all the center

1138
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,650
I'd assume the pergola different for
different sensors there very very

1139
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:07,830
proprietary the Ford was

1140
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:10,690
completely dissimilar than its way to
which I'm sure is dishonor than a

1141
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,320
Mercedes

1142
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,900
which is this summer then a BMW did
their they kinda pride themselves on

1143
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,690
having proprietary messaging

1144
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:21,080
I can actually be different between the
same make and model car like a 2006

1145
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,720
Prius

1146
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:26,370
had different messages that are 2010 and
we're doing prepared or like 20

1147
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:29,910
no encryption there's no encryption on
can messages

1148
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:33,240
I remember too that a lot overhead so
they need things work fast

1149
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,660
you know and airbag deployment can't be
a millisecond late

1150
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:40,270
is happen right away so there's really
no encryption overhead a

1151
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:44,990
Cape encryption not working no FX exact
but I thought you said a cable caused us

1152
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,120
to the protocol used by the kind the
street right

1153
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,060
it is so it you know every message is
going to be anywhere from zero to eight

1154
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,070
bytes

1155
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:55,750
update on right that application date is
gonna be proprietary per car per

1156
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,760
manufacture ok right says the higher so
it's like saying

1157
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,890
you know i'd to see everyone is DCP but
the actual like

1158
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,540
you know higher application level is all
too late random proprietors

1159
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:09,040
right sup answer there's a think RJ 1939

1160
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,760
that heavy machineries is like I trucks
and

1161
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,620
like yes like big rigs they've all
agreed on standard sets

1162
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,900
a application data messages so if you
pick the stuff up for big rig

1163
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:24,720
it's going to work for Merck although a
Freightliner Mac whatever Sasa

1164
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,030
also if you pop it rocking a pop a lot a
truck
