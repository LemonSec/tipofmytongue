1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,190
even hear from Sony first okay good I'm
gonna pick on Sony

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,230
Qualcomm I know I in a be nice to
Qualcomm kind of

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,240
a Robert so I'm Josh the

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,699
I have a company we break things are we
breaking for money

5
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:19,820
and that's what we do enjoy it it's a
lot of fun

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,730
I do hardware um and

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,060
really my happy place is the Linux
kernel

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,640
a kruk gave me a hard time last night
because my slides are horrible as far as

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,750
getting information

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,140
um sorry deal with it I wrote a white
paper

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,630
it's on get hard ball link it later if
you want to actually get

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,860
source in technical details for this
talk there's a 150 pages that I wrote

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,220
have fun with that this is going to be
pretty pictures

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,830
because I like to talk in front of
pretty pictures um

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,280
this whole research kinda started when I
started talking too much

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,700
darpa up for cyber fast-track and a lot
of it was

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,600
the community in general is looking at
AV

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,149
in looking at corporate networks and in
all these kind of things that we do and

19
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:07,490
that's

20
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,780
interesting and we play a game once you
shift over to state-sponsored mall where

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,159
unlimited budgets that game completely
changes

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,200
it's actually really interesting to me
and not many people are poking their

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,590
so I asked much like will you find me to
create a couple of theoretical weapons

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,170
that aren't in the wild but are
stereotypical

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,689
love state-sponsored tricks and tools
arm

26
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,909
and I'm just gonna present im so we can
see a different world

27
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:37,009
and he was like well like camp fund
weapons this is darpa

28
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:41,700
so why don't you make a weapon and then
make some sort of really lame pock

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,179
to defeat that weapon um this talk is
the pock

30
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:49,999
for that so um he funded need to try to
break a whole bunch of phones

31
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:53,200
that I'm telling you about it and
putting it on get hub nullifying any

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,570
weapon

33
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,929
ionisation and I'm having fun

34
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:01,450
so like I said I open source everything
I can

35
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,740
from and I when I gave this talk

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,869
are very into the stalking Microsoft
they ask if I

37
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,799
own every image I'm going to use and I
don't I'm sorry there all and get help

38
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:16,180
are on Google on which is like

39
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,510
open source right so a today we'll talk
about

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,489
just some tough design where all the
problems that I see in hardware start

41
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:28,670
um from there will kinda going to
universal exploitation

42
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,510
the story who or three depending on how
you want to count is actually

43
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,700
arm we're going to start playing with
fire in batteries and whatnot

44
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,890
a is a couple more means and then a talk
I added last night

45
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,099
at the into this again to mess with
Brock so

46
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,260
some tough design in general

47
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,079
a software/hardware you're a CPA I don't
care what you do for a living

48
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,319
everyone comes at a school they go to
accompany

49
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,780
there in new but that company they find
someone to mentor them

50
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,950
they learn how to actually do the job
because you come into school and you

51
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,329
kinda have an idea but the new relearn
everything

52
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:09,340
this is really true for software
development um

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,090
the problem is you don't really get to
pick your mentor right like you may meet

54
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,780
a guy in a company in like oh I like you
you're smart so I'm learn from you

55
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,040
but back I also just burn from someone
on he got out of school so you have this

56
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,630
kind of generational

57
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,440
I think I know what I'm doing because my
mentor said that's the right way to do

58
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,720
it

59
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,099
I think X there's you see these
generational problems that's why we're

60
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,220
still seeing string copy issues right

61
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,560
it's not because it's easy it's because
it's easy and someone told you that's

62
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,310
the way to do it

63
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,410
on so this is really true in software
used to sing and we're kind of starting

64
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,569
to fix it there

65
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:47,810
but in hardware this really still
happens all the time

66
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,269
um so whenever I actually talked to
hardware vendors one of the first things

67
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,310
I try to

68
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,280
tell people is just because you learned
it in just because you trust and respect

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,880
the person that hot shoe that

70
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,329
including me um I could be completely BS
in this whole thing

71
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,629
right I mean question olive your
assumptions because that's what I'm

72
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:08,530
going to attack

73
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,569
is all the the assumptions that you made
so

74
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,780
another caveat um science is hard cock

75
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,289
claiming all like really smooth over
some of the more technical things here

76
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:20,829
because

77
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,490
it gets in the way of the actual story
that we're gonna tell on

78
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,000
but the white paper covers everything in
dept if you have any questions please

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,760
read that

80
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,099
so I wanted to attack all the phones

81
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:35,409
I didn't just want to attack Sony didn't
want to attack same song

82
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,830
I wanted to start poking a hardware
level in C

83
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,020
what looks the same and how we can
attack everything together

84
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,900
because hardware is not magic um like we
said before

85
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,110
some to design hard for guys screw up to
so

86
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,700
universal exploitation in the US and
most of the world

87
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,409
except for this nice little pocket here
Qualcomm

88
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:02,669
is who makes Sox socks when your phone
it's a system-on-a-chip

89
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,270
that is what controls the world forget
your market share but it's like nine

90
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,320
million per cent globally or something

91
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,000
um now I think I think in the US it's
over eighty percent market share in

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,020
ninety like it's

93
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,289
ridiculous um China's about the only
country that I know what that Qualcomm

94
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:20,810
at least doesn't have fifty percent
penetration and

95
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,659
for Android phones so if you want to
attack and right at the heart

96
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:30,870
yeah

97
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,580
a they control the world so

98
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,770
from my interests there there my
platform of choice right I mean

99
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,310
everyone is going to run them um
baseband wise it's even worse but

100
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,539
main processor looking at least 50
percent market penetration

101
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:49,800
um these guys make Sox Sox do

102
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,849
everything you can't really see in this
picture but it's there advertising stuff

103
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:57,400
right they've got some CPU's in there
which they advertise is your cores the

104
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,650
get a GP you

105
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,940
um a lot of times they just a role in
the baseband right there

106
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,710
or they'll have an external baseband
you've got now have you've got

107
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,930
wifi its its everything that is a phone

108
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,240
wrapped in silicon um

109
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,830
to sell these things to hardware vendors
call comics a reference platform

110
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,389
it's basically like a sales brochure its
hey I'm Sony and I wanna make a new

111
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,020
phone what should I use in call comes
like well here's this thing

112
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,139
that uses our new chip you should buy it
and we'll come back to that

113
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,330
my attack but for that I started really
looking at here is the Sony Xperia Z

114
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,819
are bitterly picked it with the smallest
%uh vendors that I had not signed an NDA

115
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:39,780
for

116
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,669
um so I've never signed an NDA with Sony

117
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,500
a maybe some of the other companies I
have which is why I didn't

118
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,190
attacked them directly um

119
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,330
you take the Sony apart this is what it
looks like its X the

120
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,660
fairly pretty get the PCB up there in
the corner which is what we care about

121
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,250
I I take a lot of phones apart so

122
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,319
that guy runs the Qualcomm s4 pro the

123
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,660
the Moto X also runs at the LG Nexus 4
runs the same thing

124
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,430
they've got a different variant have the
same chip that runs the s3

125
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,889
a I mean you can start seeing
penetration from

126
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,569
from Qualcomm here this powers basically
every

127
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,840
high-end phone on the market um

128
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,550
and they're all based on can have the
same design so each vendor makes a phone

129
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,160
up but they'll kind of have the same
problems start wondering why i like it

130
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,379
took all the PCB's apartment like said
I'm on my desk and looked at him in a

131
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,440
sec well

132
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,780
you know they're physically maybe
slightly the same size but they all look

133
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,259
the same

134
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,610
all the traces go the same place and
they're just not doing anything

135
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,060
creative um why is that

136
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,449
but everyone just duct tapes and wraps
around this thing which is

137
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,930
are sales pamphlet I was talking about
so

138
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,690
you can buy these or you can try to
they've got great specs the psych

139
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,150
quad-core blah blah blah blah blah it's
a phone

140
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,370
um you got a call comes website like

141
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,270
I wanna buy this matter phone that
everything is based off of the josh is

142
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,930
talking about

143
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,199
you can put in your shopping cart and
pay 800 US and

144
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,389
click except in the charger credit card
on

145
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:18,460
and then about two or three weeks later
when you're going where's my phone you

146
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,289
get email basically saying

147
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:23,270
your security researcher your hacker
we're not going to give you those things

148
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,479
sorry

149
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,479
um that's cool because I bought one

150
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,979
anyway because yday wins um

151
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:36,810
we have a bunch right so

152
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,539
I'm yet so I started

153
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,930
publicly bitching about Qualcomm inc.'s
about two years ago and

154
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,990
talk more and more and more in I'll
fight with Qualcomm people I had talks

155
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,810
with their lawyers

156
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,620
talks with our sales guys no one wanted
to talk to me because I was a dirty

157
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,140
dirty dirty hacker

158
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,420
um finally headed to talk smoke on axe
the

159
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,930
right before it blue hat and met Brian
Brian

160
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,120
in his team were incredibly awesome an
almost

161
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,800
every ill will and hatred I had towards
the company turned into love just

162
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,300
actually like this one small group of
guys

163
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,520
um having said that if I'd ever signed
an NDA with you

164
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,160
I be violating the crap outta for the
rest to this talk but I have not

165
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,459
and ya seem to be cool with that which
is nice on

166
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:24,760
lastly a caveat that when I first
contacted Qualcomm with

167
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,600
the power stuff though will get to right
after this I promise

168
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,110
they said there's no problem and then
they said there was no problem

169
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,240
and then again email with a bug numbers
saying there's totally no problem

170
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,319
but here's a bug tracking thing that
we're just making sure to look into it

171
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:43,030
an about two days ago I gotta email
saying

172
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,390
thing that didn't exist that wasn't a
problem is still not a problem but it's

173
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,760
been fixed and you'll get

174
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,880
attribution for it being fixed it's on
our website

175
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,459
um like cool none of the stuff actually
works

176
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:59,770
but it's been fixed so random test plan
on getting back to it

177
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,920
this is some random Sony phone see the
PCB

178
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,530
the this is a moto-x if I'm gonna

179
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,640
guess right um no

180
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,420
remember what the hell this was its like
just a bunch of random phones that's

181
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,490
what I do

182
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,600
this is my desk I get phones to take
them apart

183
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,199
i play with them a look at 'em a try to
pop on

184
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:26,280
a when I'm done with them I put it back
in the case they go on the pink box when

185
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,290
the pink boxes for the pink box goes on
eBay and I get a new pink box this is

186
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,780
my life this is what I do um and

187
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,860
domo-kun helps me out it's pretty easy

188
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,630
um so spoke at that depth platform
because that's what's

189
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,299
actually interesting my hypothesis in
this is actually

190
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:49,020
charlie's Miller's ha fault from the
Black Cat talk years ago about batteries

191
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,299
rate the Q

192
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:54,400
you put it Apple batteries it's a great
to weaponize that and then put in

193
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,579
someone's pocket that be

194
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,199
really really cool or horrible bad no
one should do that

195
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:04,049
um but if I'm in the kernel which is not
hard to do

196
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:08,400
um Irish chin public control the voltage
in the phone

197
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,970
and is there any protections to keep me
from doing anything really stupid or bad

198
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,299
there um inside are bitterly just picked
the Sony in

199
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:21,170
you know that's what we're gonna poke at
but what I what I saw

200
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,809
um in general with all of these phones
as they're all based on that reference

201
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,959
platform so if it was

202
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,850
viable to do an attack on the Sony it
was viable to do it on

203
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,220
some other vendor that I can't name um
pretty much

204
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,640
all of the vendors because they all you
know if there was not a resistor

205
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,640
or a capacitor to keep me from pushing
too much ball to cheer

206
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,100
it was on every phone because it's on
your sales but for on

207
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,030
and everyone's kinda takes that goes
also middle lot of engineering for us

208
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,420
up I don't have to I'm lazy

209
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,390
um so yeah on that restores raw power

210
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:01,049
this is kinda far context right USB he
pushes power into the system

211
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:04,760
you have AP mache this is a a

212
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,189
very typical hardware thing that
basically managers actual push power

213
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:09,919
here here and here

214
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,439
um that is used allies to distribute the
voltages

215
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,660
around the the internal secure phone the
kernel manages the clinic

216
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,900
the P mick is really slow it's like a
arm southerner and r9 compared to the

217
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,819
actual create course it's really really
slow

218
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:27,829
um n

219
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:31,980
the the crux if you walked out right now
is that not all traces coming out of the

220
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,150
battery and out of the Pemex to go
certain places like you're screening

221
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,059
your wifi chip

222
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:41,069
are protected by really really cheap
capsule resistors you're talking about

223
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:44,410
one 10 the penny probably a map mass
production

224
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,049
um but it takes engineering to put him
there and they take sizing

225
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:51,230
heat dissipation just they'd didn't do
it

226
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,579
him that's problematic on

227
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:57,589
so how do we get into power regulation

228
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:01,860
I if you look at Lenox because it's well
documented in its very very

229
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,380
old you go to documentation power
regulator overview

230
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,380
in this thing tells you exactly how
power flows through a Linux system

231
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,400
it's pretty simple its amazingly well
documented for Linux

232
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,140
um and it will basically say that there
are less than 10 .co.nz

233
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,069
files throughout all of the kernel the
control voltage low

234
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,260
on people have figured this out way
before when they've tried

235
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,290
overture overclock processors and

236
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,699
with everything else in Android it's
basically just the Linux kernel soak up

237
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:32,880
ported over

238
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,089
I'm what you want for any specific
target you have

239
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:42,459
is you're going to have a your product
name underscore regulator dot see file

240
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:47,480
and that file defines exactly how power
flows

241
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,419
throughout that whole PCB that is the
magic sauce secrets just got two numbers

242
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:52,819
in there you change those numbers

243
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:56,069
and you've hacked some phones

244
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:00,740
um I did all this blind if one were to
search

245
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,130
the internets for a while you can find a
nice

246
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,520
dump up Qualcomm documentation that may
make this research

247
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,689
a lot easier um I did not know this
existed until after a trap this project

248
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:16,309
and I got really frustrated because if
I'd seen those docs prior

249
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:19,400
I hardly would have done this in half
the time indifferent

250
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,910
um so if you're really curious to

251
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,299
go after this um I did not tell you
their stocks and you're not getting for

252
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,520
me but they're out there

253
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,689
on and they're not that hard to find

254
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:35,290
again we're packing on Sony love about
these things called you go so actually

255
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,530
looking at Uganda score regulator for
the rest

256
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,709
this a the first thing that you have to
know if I win or attacking a phone is

257
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,260
the thermal regulator

258
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,669
this thing is a nice little sensor in
the sensor detects

259
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:50,780
how hot or cold um

260
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,169
things in the phone are they don't wanna
to catch fire and blow up in your pocket

261
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:55,339
and I wanted to catch fire

262
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,079
up in your pocket so this is like my my
first attack surface

263
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,540
um the regulator in general is really
simple

264
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,199
it's run by Damon which is thermal d the
kinda runs and checks everything

265
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,559
pursing I was just like all killed a man
right on a lot of things rely on this to

266
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,530
figure out like

267
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,400
how fast to charge the battery house
lotion i turn the screen on do i do

268
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,290
brightness

269
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:22,120
on sings really complex and everything's
latching and the thermal d to get

270
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,250
data on so I just started

271
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,169
killing it really didn't work as the
phone and run so I started looking down

272
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:29,459
into it and it's got

273
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:33,500
at one point code that basically says if
you hit

274
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,809
this temperature do this if you hit this
temperature do this

275
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:41,299
so take the first one is just you know
start shutting down processes try to

276
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:42,799
call the processor of

277
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,959
um all the way to shut down the phone

278
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:50,650
on but they're just numbers so I just
change the numbers and have recompile so

279
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,209
now instead of

280
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,640
shutting the phone off it like a hundred
degrees it has to get to six million

281
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,720
degrees before

282
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,339
decides to shut off integrating get
fired before then

283
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:04,020
home see how we can't we can't use

284
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,919
thermal we can use that thing to to
directly for other thing look kinda got

285
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,929
a new to it

286
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:13,699
um its easier to tweak it than just kill
it

287
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:16,880
so we're going to attack the sock on
this phone on

288
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,049
this was my horrible research fail that
actually should a person did it fail con

289
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:24,949
instead um the trait course directly if
you just go

290
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:28,339
I want to give you a ton of voltage I
her

291
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,120
really good at that front door to say
like nah man you you can't do that

292
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,280
on all the internal protections seem to
work

293
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,799
basically if you pushed too much voltage
through they just reboot

294
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,110
so you get a really unstable phone that
you can't do much with but

295
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,429
thats not really fire um

296
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:50,780
so as an aside every person on the
Internet you're really Google I want to

297
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,870
overclock

298
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,020
axe on there's always that one dude on
the forums

299
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,199
had a few overclocker your computer its
gonna catch fire

300
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,620
liked F that guy cuz if I could have
done that this would be a totally

301
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,010
different presentation

302
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,449
um I'm had my Sony thinking it was
raining at 6.6 gigahertz incentive

303
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:12,260
1.2 for 2.0 like it really should have
caught fire

304
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,919
if that guy was right he's a liar know
you hate him

305
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,449
um so but I can

306
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,059
overclock like crazy and I can push too
much voltage through an item

307
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:26,569
tweak the settings just right before
that the sock

308
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:31,590
turns off it when I'm using a lot more
power than I normally am

309
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,850
from there I'm also on the kernel saying
change the USB stack to basically say

310
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,559
never allow me to charge

311
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,289
on some overclocking running it on a
power I'm not able to charge

312
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:44,840
I can persist those values on reboot so
basically once the

313
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,039
phone runs through that battery once it
can never be charged again

314
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,230
and we have our first break and bakie
bricks I only get .5

315
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,890
um for it incall come get 212 sexy did a
good job but where

316
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:05,870
in keeping score i kind of one we've got
one back to the ghost in the graveyard

317
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,630
but I look that way more than just the
main sock

318
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,510
on land is kinda the thing I like to
poke at so we poked at that next

319
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,860
on in the Qualcomm design they've
actually got this nice little thing that

320
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,880
sets

321
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,370
in the middle love power in both and and
the SD card controler

322
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,919
if your phone uses SD on in this is the

323
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,110
7x 00 a SDCC

324
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,140
on so it sits on the traces gets

325
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,320
you know power from the Pemex through
the battery

326
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,160
add a reply neck this thing and then it
pushes for the job both ways

327
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,220
and regulator dot C gets changed these
values are kinda junkie

328
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,840
you gotta play with him quite a bit but
furthest first hack

329
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,260
all we did was arm have a point there

330
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,169
so it was saying give this guy 2.95
bolts

331
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:04,830
have power basically and I just roughly
double that

332
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,129
on now are pushing way more power in
tune and for reads and writes then we

333
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:10,019
should

334
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,509
on you have to do it twice

335
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:18,860
and when we do that I'll really simply
so we're talking about changing

336
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,549
to numerical values in compiled code if
you don't wanna recompile

337
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:25,950
arm when we do that every time that

338
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,750
the processor reaches out to me and to
try to read data eg it's massively

339
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,389
corrupted coming back

340
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:35,919
every time we try to write 10 and it's
massively corrupted when rating

341
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,309
because there's just too much power
trying to do that the name and

342
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:43,490
that is on me sony's at least -ism
doesn't handle that well

343
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,889
arm and for some weird reason at least
on fast reboots

344
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:51,850
home and I think it's a pub love warm
first cold reboot but the P make value

345
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,059
seem to be stored

346
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,169
on they don't long

347
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:59,799
have to reset from the kernel when it's
booting back up so

348
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:04,169
those pemex values that I'm saying if I
just do a quick review to the phone

349
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:08,070
now I'm not only corrupting what I was
trying to read but

350
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,549
I've corrupted the whole OS on desk
because when it reached out to try to

351
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:12,759
read it from and

352
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,139
it's corrupted this man blocks a list of
things to time but it's not now we have

353
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:21,139
a pretty deep brick on the phone um
because all done and is just

354
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:24,509
garbage at that point all the blocks
basically you're dead

355
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:28,360
with push too much power and then just
don't work anymore

356
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,169
so we we can I broke it but it was
really ugly um

357
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:36,409
at this point I got curious what if we
just incentive doubling the voltage to

358
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:37,440
try to

359
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,789
you know fry a component but if we have
to voltage this was

360
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:45,029
way cooler to me from go

361
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:48,799
so on lower voltages then creates still
work

362
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,799
so you can call data in you can read it
like normal your phones running

363
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,289
as soon as you try to write that right
returns the yes I wrote correctly

364
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:01,210
but most of the time in X they didn't
write correctly

365
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,370
um depending on how you set those
voltages

366
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,299
it almost never writes correctly so you
can with changing

367
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:11,690
to numerical values in a run time
colonel

368
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,639
you can basically injector write blocker
into a phone

369
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:19,200
just by playing with values on I thought
that was kinda cool

370
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,159
personally home and again it

371
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,299
persists over reboot if you've actually
written those

372
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,629
values back into the kernel so now we do
have a break

373
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:33,629
we've got a fairly control bricks that
we can play with so I'm

374
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:36,840
for keeping score I'm ahead right now

375
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,480
let's try to enjoy that chasm last um

376
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,110
attacking wifi again this is it's built
into the sock

377
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,450
um the sock does have some ball grid
array pens at the bottom on the sock to

378
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,299
come out that are

379
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:54,610
direct access to the hardware internal
so not everything has to go through to

380
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,730
the main front door to see when you look
at the regulator file which will pull up

381
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,529
in a little bit

382
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,659
it's basically got three regulators l4
10 in s2

383
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:09,809
are used to power and control life I
wifi chips are pretty easy to manipulate

384
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:11,110
because

385
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:16,039
the kernel in the just from home
environment knows that wifi chips can

386
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:16,580
drain a

387
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,190
time on a power saw it already
dynamically scales how much power this

388
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,090
thing needs

389
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,710
based on how crappy your wifi connection
s she got really good signal

390
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,980
attacks the powers like does a low power
mode on wifi cuz it doesn't need it to

391
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,419
push it on a power in on there some
other configuration stuff that's

392
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,970
document in the white paper

393
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,740
on just how the wifi chip itself works

394
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,470
but you play with those three values and
you can start trying to fry

395
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,139
the actual i5 chip again it was
protected inside the sock so

396
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:52,629
all that the direct attacks I did to it
on

397
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:55,749
basically didn't try it I too good

398
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,909
not has reliably with me and i could get
it to work every time with the right

399
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:00,620
blocker

400
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,889
with WiFi I can edge up and corrupt a
lot of the data

401
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:08,879
see could do some weird really way too
expensive

402
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:12,559
pseudo denial of service but it wasn't
wasn't really sexy

403
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,669
but it someone to polly pocket harder
there and get

404
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:19,909
some interesting things with WiFi but I
couldn't burn anything internal to the

405
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:20,980
sock

406
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,299
USB the kinda party went over on

407
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:30,070
USB starts getting a little more
complicated than the direct attacks we

408
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,940
were doing

409
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,990
so now we've got pemex values the tax
the

410
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,110
were also having to do with GPIO pins

411
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:43,269
so needed really well to protect against
this Samsung has failed horribly

412
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:48,190
on this front um the galaxy s3 in
particular

413
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,860
a lot of people around the world were
having issues where they turn on USB

414
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,360
on-the-go so this should give up our
something

415
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,950
sings the plug something in that once
power handshake over USB that says hey I

416
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,090
want five votes in the fungus cool I'll
give you five votes

417
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,350
and there's a trace that goes between
there for USB

418
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,779
that's got a nice little cap on it that
basically can't handle 5 volts

419
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:12,940
so when you try to push footage through
it blows that cap

420
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,149
and I've got a bricked phone I didn't
even have to do this I just google for

421
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:17,759
this one and try to figure out

422
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,700
what happened um so Sony actually does
better there they can do on the go power

423
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,649
on time some failed and got a whole
bunch of our maze before they

424
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:31,259
fix the problem I believe home

425
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,700
but with USB were controlling voltages
week and the same trickery with Nan and

426
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,149
WiFi we can corrupt a whole bunch of
data in transit

427
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:42,879
on we can do the disabled charging track
which I mentioned earlier

428
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:46,139
which basically means that we can break
any fun we won but its

429
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:50,870
it's not sexy um I did try to push it

430
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,399
on a voltage over 30g on

431
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,720
and basically got it to the limit that
the battery could push

432
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,190
but again it's at that point we're not
attacking phone or attacking whatever

433
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,330
tricky thing we plugged into the phone
the power on

434
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,370
and I don't expect a lot of those text
to be resilient

435
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:13,230
and they worked so

436
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,720
not aware not a loss taking the power
play I'm

437
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,499
so whatever you're looking at PCB design
in general

438
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:23,580
um if you get to that level up hardware

439
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,740
you notice that there's no multi planes

440
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,429
wrapped in silicon not your PC be one of
those planes typically is power

441
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:37,450
one of those is typically ground so my
question was what if I up the power on

442
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,289
that

443
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:43,669
on this is four components that part
specifically saying I need one point two

444
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:47,220
bolts they're just like I need the
resident 3.3 on the platform

445
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,850
and they all just kind of power of this
ground plane it's easier than

446
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,169
doing a whole bunch of specific traces
from the P mic

447
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:58,119
the P make pushes at 3.3 volts down
there we up that

448
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:01,649
and we broke the phone I mean it was
broken

449
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:04,869
was the best break I had actually broke
three phones and put him in a little

450
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:05,610
graveyard

451
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,450
Fort I down have no idea what broke it
was some

452
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,279
one too many random components internal
to the phone

453
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,720
that I could never get it to boot at all
and none of my analysis

454
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,519
could figure out what happened but if
all you wanted to do is kill the phone

455
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,549
in motion

456
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:26,049
on dumb six bolts to the ground her to
the power plants or 3.3

457
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:29,159
then you've got fire on are not fire but

458
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,470
eight dead broken hunk of plastic in
your pocket

459
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,049
um the Sony actually has two or three
power planes

460
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:41,220
got a 1.2 3.3 and I think one more that
is powering from a

461
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,230
the the battery so there's a lot of

462
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,039
discrete components you can attack if
all you wanna do his room

463
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,249
seven hundred dollars for the phone
somebody

464
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:56,759
getting them or to have discreet targets
that the white paper will cover

465
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,240
in detail we I attacked the screen in
the same way to push too much voltage to

466
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,230
it

467
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,850
the surprise I can corrupt data like
crazy I can definitely not power the

468
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,809
screen

469
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:10,590
um that doesn't really break anything
the screen if you

470
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,649
flash a new kernel and everything and
push it back on it it

471
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:16,980
works um the camera can at the same
thing

472
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,159
when the cameras never kind of work but
the other two or three phones are traded

473
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:20,519
on

474
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,990
continue to work some in a call that a a
fail um

475
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,440
audio hardware

476
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,799
have not real interesting to me what
what are you gonna do

477
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,840
you wanna not have someone listen mp3's
thats that's not great

478
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,850
I'm I did not spend really anytime with
the hexagon

479
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,549
or the baseband because ralph RPW

480
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:45,659
kinda lives there and I just

481
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,429
if he hasn't pulled it off and I'm not
going to I was lazy and just kinda went

482
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:53,539
at you could probably do the same thing
on

483
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:58,259
so at this point right before we get to
the actual battery attacks

484
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:03,129
um I've had seven yr 8 phones that have
broken

485
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:07,720
gonna get myself a score 2.5 and
Qualcomm actually gets a4

486
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,559
they hurt me pretty quick but I do still
have a handful bricks

487
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:14,820
on my desk the battery

488
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,090
um everything else that

489
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,809
I've talked about and here in the paper
was 234 maybe ten lines of code to

490
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:23,600
change

491
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,460
the battery was freakin hard um way way
way way way more

492
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,559
components to tweak to try to either

493
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,330
don't wait too much power into it while
charging or

494
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,460
completely empty the battery on there
was a lot of code

495
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,090
had to change in general the way the
batteries work

496
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,240
is not the slides because I fail is on

497
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,289
there's an embedded microcontroller and
the battery that basically handles

498
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:56,059
you know MI charge to my not charged on
the Sony's in particular

499
00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:00,720
that thing can be disabled by the kernel
the kernel can say hey I'm smarter than

500
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,119
you mister battery

501
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:05,220
um I'm going to manage so that was kinda
the first thing he had to do

502
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,700
after disable them direct thermal
regulation and then

503
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,580
have the kernel take control a battery
management at that point

504
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,889
had to start playing with how much
voltage can we actually push here and

505
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:16,549
there

506
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:19,619
can i push more how much can I get out
of the wall

507
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:24,460
okay how much can I get out love a
better wall plug like maybe 220 in sort

508
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,720
of 1-10 in the US

509
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,379
like how much if I've got no protections
even on my cable and just plugging into

510
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:35,200
to 110 coming out of the wall how much
can I get in the phone

511
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,679
on

512
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,850
tweaking with the same things basically
I'm just trying to push

513
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,690
as much voltage is possible and burn
this phone as quickly as possible

514
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,259
on I get it really hot like a lot of the
Sony phones that I have right now if you

515
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:51,190
put them

516
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,610
you can't pick them up they are way too
hot for that

517
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:59,090
um they burn through the battery too
fast to do anything but be really really

518
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,470
really hot

519
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,470
um and they don't actually catch fire
they don't melt

520
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,139
that man they feel like if I could just
get another 10 min to battery life out

521
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,799
of them they probably would

522
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,470
I'm but I can't sustain that without

523
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,009
killing the phone a having to recharge
it

524
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:21,879
so i cant I that was all internal to the
phone

525
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:25,259
then I was like okay well if I allow
myself to plug into the wall to get

526
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:25,909
hotter

527
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:30,840
am can actually get melting I got a
phone

528
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,429
that the backup the plastic started
melting from

529
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:37,720
the battery but I still couldn't achieve
fire and

530
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,499
it was recoverable once I flashed
another

531
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:45,499
firmware on their um it never really
worked again

532
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:48,570
in a functional like I will use this as
a daily driver

533
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:54,499
but it was basically a fail

534
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:57,529
so to attack the battery ahead turnoff
for the thermal checks

535
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:02,440
turnoff for the voltage feel saves a
capacity fail safes which basically the

536
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,320
battery says

537
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,480
I can only take a hundred percent charge
like comment actually can take a

538
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,159
thousand percent charge

539
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,269
um or there's other checks that
basically say

540
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:15,559
you know I will never allow myself to
get below two percent charged he

541
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,700
actually said that to -2

542
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,239
errors:0 on there's a lot of

543
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:24,700
exploration hubby still left in like
fast-charging

544
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,129
I'm if you're interested in the two
months

545
00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:32,399
a failure I had with that the doc
starting at page 62 in going to like

546
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,649
110 document everything I tried and
failed

547
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:40,179
speaking at the doc it is here because
everything and it is open source

548
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:44,090
so you should be able to go to get have
been polled on not only the doc but

549
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,690
every single stage if kernel modules to

550
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,169
play with this home

551
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:55,269
and in general and very fast that his
burner so

552
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:58,809
going to say thank you

553
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:04,480
do we have any questions about burner
before I move on to new stuff

554
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,700
in the back

555
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,210
so you can only change the values once
for

556
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,489
and you have to recompile so you're not
able to use a pulse

557
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:21,830
the values between different streams are
you

558
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,440
so if you start digging into regulator
more um

559
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,100
then again there is so much to cover I
can a priest over a lot of it but there

560
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,210
are some

561
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,519
things like the main processor wifi
things that you have dynamic power

562
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,749
during runtime

563
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:39,259
um sum up those values are actually
stored in an XML file just in the route

564
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:42,539
yeah just rooted phone so those you can
just plain text

565
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:46,499
at it um there's other ones that you
would have to

566
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:50,299
excite lunar module that would do it for
you um

567
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:55,519
but they are about half the components
on the phone have dynamic voltage so you

568
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,409
could easily glitch that way

569
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,759
as I think that's pretty much what
you're getting at its center clutching

570
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:00,539
um

571
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:05,669
there's other components just say I
shall only ever use 1.2 volts

572
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:09,210
and those are more they from what I
could figure out

573
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,789
I was a change it once load my

574
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:17,710
load module on phone didn't work reboot
change value

575
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,799
Marshall that answer s are

576
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,970
agree

577
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,799
again and I rushed through that is
actually wanted to talk about something

578
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,259
else

579
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:31,669
as well but first I wanted to say thank
you to Thomas for

580
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:32,049
perhaps
