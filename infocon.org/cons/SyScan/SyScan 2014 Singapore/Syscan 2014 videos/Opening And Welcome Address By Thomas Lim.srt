101
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,150
summit

102
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,600
topics that about about failure feel
insecure RT so we could have I would be

103
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,979
we have three trees because

104
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:12,479

obvious

105
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,580
he'll be talking about how to feel with
LDP and

106
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,639
and then you have farm the talking with
ice

107
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,130
they'll be talking about I i think is
like

108
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,520
I think that putting up a skeet is Molly
a comedy putting up so

109
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,580
way for that so because I have with I

110
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,889
feel quite embark on about the whiskey
card issuer tomorrow

111
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:36,240
I'll be week the lighting top tomorrow
we'll put up a bought

112
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,259
anybody in the audience can come up and
and do a presentation

113
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,430
you can basically say anything you wanna
so but the rules

114
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,300
ID's for every five minutes like that
you want

115
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,010
you must don't do shots of whiskey just
before you talk

116
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,430
alright so you need 10 minutes that's
four shots of whiskey in a 50 min is

117
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,449
that the choice of whiskey

118
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,990
before Utah alright Nowitzki no talk

119
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,639
simple as that alright as the BBC
contest will be fun it's gonna be messy

120
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,070
we got a half the best speaker contest
this year

121
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,580
alright have been talking about me but
finally we managed to get money

122
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,909
so the best speaker at those

123
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:21,080
will go up but I can talk you're not
include it but the best speaker

124
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,190
will walk away with a thousand dollars
cash alright and

125
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,919
of view I expect that the boat for your
choice of the best speaker

126
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,130
which we would do it tomorrow at n of
the conference

127
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,639
USD

128
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,500
what is that I've never heard of them
i'm talking about real money here a sec

129
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,029

130
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:48,820

132
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,360

134
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,210
