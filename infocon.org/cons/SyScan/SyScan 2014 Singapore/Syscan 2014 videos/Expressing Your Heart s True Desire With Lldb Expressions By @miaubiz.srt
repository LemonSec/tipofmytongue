1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,500
I'm now Ben I worked for the US Army and
arm

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,600
I'm really talking about Lobb to 10

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,590
and our Sanford's mostly like a 30
minute demo

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,880
up to greatness %uh LBB I'll be sitting
down here

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,429
and I'll try to put the mic in the span
and if you can hear me

6
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,230
yell at me and I'll rabbit on do it with
one hand

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,019
like yes Annan

8
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:35,019
expert masturbator print

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,960
bag have been alright

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,170
so who here have used LBB

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:49,170
sign who likes it

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,120
alright been few people like it a prime

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,130
so that arm so in max you always had the
wonderful

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:04,160
are for their DDB

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,850
6.3 and ban no bite on

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,840
at in are

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,300
Charlie Miller claims that it's possible
to put pipe on into the earth

18
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,180
he remembers yeah I compelled you to be
friend point seven and I coach signed at

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,190
and

20
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,350
something something and I Marco en libro
en

21
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,340
ban yeah and then I hear rumors been as
big a light really

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,850
know it now a crash on startup but not

23
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,770
JS so

24
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,000
I would Mavericks you no longer get GDP

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,700
also on iphone but there's also yes

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,360
and arm apparently I it's still have it

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,780
can and are left it on or something arm

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,010
on yeah so I was forced to sell BB

29
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,040
to do the back computer Bangor and the
IRS bank

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,299
and then I thought I like that and I got
accepted and brands like so it really

31
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,100
should be right

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,530
and our but I might not know it's
awesome and I started throwing him

33
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,180
a good and then I realized whole what
I'm telling him and perhaps the

34
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,000
conference room

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,860
at actually really crap and arm

36
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,430
so one of the things is that arm mmm

37
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,890
okay return them kinda API to get better

38
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,430
program counter and a lot of the in the
arm

39
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,549
at give you the program counter and arm

40
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:38,030
but if you actually like button if into
bite on file an executed

41
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,110
panel just give you some random number
and then

42
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,220
simon Reeve Palin yeah that's fine

43
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,220
and of but now since it's not in a

44
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,600
separate at and

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,580
and Ben just going briefly over there
are some power

46
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,980
only be in that pastry very

47
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,810
channel that's it a threat to you eight
hundred lines

48
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,820
and out

49
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,820
be defect unique what

50
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,939
here Aden LDP command history and has
like

51
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:21,180
eighty instances and continue I don't
know

52
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,780
800 or so lines thank you only be

53
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,090
back if you LDB yourself then

54
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,939
change BestBuy and you have to massmann
something called our path which

55
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:37,840
as hard

56
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,349
so mom so than to get over

57
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,870
this problem of getting the wrong
register value I figured I can just do

58
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,719
rere from Python I tell the command
interpreter

59
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,510
LGBT run rere and managed or indirect
tax

60
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,019
and then I get best in are doing better
than I wrap it in Python

61
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,280
and I forgot about it and then I'm
coming. Bandhan and I realized that I

62
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,659
love

63
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,989
horrible back it from work and Phil are

64
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,170
again on my paper and a program and arm

65
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,340
through here

66
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,069
here's the help and arm

67
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,470
so when you when you get me and then you

68
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,410
perhaps the re-re on the command line
danny gatton

69
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,849
registers for the current plan but if
you're doing it from pipe and you get in

70
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,330
for

71
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,520
red 0 no matter which gonna start which
is

72
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,160
the more specially since the weird
command to register readers in

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,490
allow you to specify which spread you're
talking about in

74
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,449
so than arm

75
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,219
I can just arm

76
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:54,830
up for him so first iterate

77
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,930
in a weird back at other plans

78
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,909
and ask the ghetto which spread is now
stop

79
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:06,520
which sometimes returns don't wanna stop
and the night go from there and I

80
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,150
go through wonderfully API

81
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,229
bang ministers and I compare our index

82
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:17,379
iraq's amber then I can get the value

83
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:24,379
but sometimes arm on

84
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,460
okay here so I'm

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,540
probably not the right bank

86
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Mets

87
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,479
I'm

88
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:58,449
okay for now are here and the note read
more stop

89
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,929
I went wrong and there's nothing there
me as a consumer software is called

90
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:03,679
greatness

91
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,939
are and defects birth

92
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,869
you can are the load them up drip

93
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:14,309
now if under stop red clue

94
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:17,819
sometime reloading doesn't work it

95
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,879
it's still broken but instead if you go
in and the comment your

96
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,829
being statement where bring out the Bang
worry

97
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:32,059
in arm watch the stop a reason for it
but then it starts working

98
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:36,110
happen that's how you work around this
issue Anderson

99
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,569
just one of the many she and here on

100
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:45,110
here in and back overflow business
question problem

101
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,429
but basically says he wants to run
multiple commands on one line

102
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:53,969
and Dom or in one one command he was
much more thanks

103
00:06:53,969 --> 00:07:00,969
and breast cancers yes

104
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,330
so that point in

105
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,700
their own deliberate decision to avoid
blah blah blah blah blah

106
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,220
the on purpose made

107
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,350
known I intact

108
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:36,350
everything at so instead of doing
something like

109
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,400
best they want to team

110
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,280
best one and our it so that you do
everything in Python

111
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,340
and I so this guy who replied in

112
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,990
con tu but the mic

113
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,099
so then I and on

114
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,430
no he and I 118 this Melinda and Melinda

115
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,569
and then I see that misty commits by him

116
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,159
someone else to buy him am by him so he
let developers

117
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,580
we can trust him a berth the be paying
about

118
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,000
Lobb that apparently are do not have

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,039
like GB morning with a bug

120
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:27,930
as bad you have this thing called
expression and on

121
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,690
it comes in handy begin all the features
better actually in the other two batters

122
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,250
in

123
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,829
way showing the me permissions for

124
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:41,360
memory region arm LBB doesn't have that
feature

125
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,910
Bandung so then you need something weird
few

126
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,399
state for this deficiency and has this
column

127
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,620
think of expression where are basically
saying

128
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,990
you created

129
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,380
into outer space so no from the process

130
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,680
manager 1 and then

131
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,779
you came during Minister and our

132
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,800
basically can be put in and he

133
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,450
yen you can put in NEC

134
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,459
c plus plus project you could arm

135
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:23,790
at all interpreter ion

136
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:29,000
or just compile and Dom

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,620
in whatever is the last eight min on

138
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,820
your expression will be the return value
in tel aviv BRB expression

139
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,550
in Safari here

140
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,100
arm Bieber outer space up on safari

141
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,649
now arm buggy

142
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:52,699
religion rather in

143
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:55,720
the bars after Smith and now

144
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,899
you can okay you

145
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,449
besides these drills tape it's that
actually

146
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:05,740
not helping to debug an arm

147
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,199
you can I think young

148
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:12,370
New Guinea

149
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,199
my you can type in any

150
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,329
CC was blasted NBC programming haven't
run

151
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:26,850
insider process so problem but I had
basically what I wanted to see the

152
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,990
region's up I mean the permissions and
so on for the nine regions

153
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,579
and one way to do it on the Mac

154
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,320
band team mmm

155
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,709
as he young

156
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,890
so you can run bien he

157
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,970
can use to hear me

158
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,380
I think going down can

159
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,760
gap hear me now you

160
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,029
government Brandt so

161
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,540
what you can do no harm you can run be a
map on them

162
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,910
command line and Brandon look at the
results

163
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,660
me but i dont know yep I have here

164
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,260
my register

165
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,170
RBP best I can for mmm

166
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:30,170
up

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,170
packed so I can just located here and
then

168
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,160
I it next argues that which in from
Python

169
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,550
launch on the command line be a man and
ban

170
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,020
marzen with record soon in

171
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,710
those wonderful ban on diana's obviously
you can

172
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,410
run stuff from from the posts

173
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,630
and the command line in IRS began

174
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:06,910
there is an not even bien map several
them so I had to find another way in

175
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,170
band so this expression band

176
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,510
can be are arbitrarily complicated

177
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,010
and then it's good team during Python

178
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,520
rather than on the command line and an
hour

179
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,150
so this guy you wrote a book about are

180
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,720
bona fide three months whatever and he

181
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,300
published author command mines plan on
being mapped at sea

182
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,839
which basically you know we implement
%um

183
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,730
its open-source so and then you need to
do a lot of our code signing and on

184
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,110
no things you where you have

185
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,230
pls XML be stuff in it and then

186
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,930
it's hard but an arm because I will be
be already

187
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,940
I'm has better get past prepared to

188
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,480
and I'm everything and it's already
defined in the process then this code

189
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,620
will actually because it'll be run and
the party process and you don't need to

190
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,400
care about any permissions whatever

191
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,620
are so than arm you

192
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,589
putting huge chants urban

193
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:20,600
C code and through arm into pipe on

194
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,690
into strain and many hope a compound

195
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,750
I N and open up in

196
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:33,750
because I'm so basically

197
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,490
become you normally you'd include a
buncha Petters

198
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,880
more you'd have do you believe that
because you're calling from API

199
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,959
which I thank is Mac bien region here

200
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,100
are clear calling that API and I'll

201
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,330
champion trucks that defined arguments
and

202
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:00,420
blah blah blah so than you can including
headers because you're actually in LBB

203
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,480
not beings than one program so using

204
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,530
going going to you on

205
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,230
into

206
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,070
your Xcode in 10 you find heather's
there

207
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,080
and arm

208
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,990
G wrong

209
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,020
up and then he

210
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,580
copy all these trucks into Europe right
now I'm and I'm

211
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,180
Tom mmm

212
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,970
and then began band code was actually
using

213
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,700
something called be in matters T which
in

214
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,279
in fact and then you have all these bike
path

215
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,490
bad actually be fine and for

216
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,839
want bank you doing and Ong

217
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,080
and here's an

218
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,370
son hath and our and I combine for

219
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,320
so

220
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:12,320
or eyelash I understand me n region
expanded info blah blah blah

221
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:18,100
and December 14 sacks many string
substitute them into this monster

222
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,459
Ben and burn

223
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:25,310
you run the bank but on the

224
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,480
you so

225
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,850
arm only place that actually has be you
know

226
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,279
LDP things done in existence his own

227
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,950
so when you get LBB it has been

228
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,130
correctly called examples and basically

229
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,130
here there's one LBB people

230
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,440
bed on their own in

231
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,650
nom

232
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,740
and here here's where I found on

233
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,700
party do the production master string
replacement

234
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,980
copied from here and Bernard attack

235
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,520
to actually do this %um at bank for now

236
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,610
arm fans nothing like a cooking show we
started word I love

237
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,800
man and now years to complete a pain

238
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,540
San

239
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,700
you probably won't burn say you wanna
for

240
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:36,060
and broadband then you just get them

241
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,070
results for through what you wanted

242
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:47,070
and their fans are

243
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:56,210
okay

244
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,570
my back so

245
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,220
in that's what I was aiming and an
outburst

246
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,300
demo and Ron fax back this work equally
and on

247
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,909
on om and I are for long

248
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,710
and because now and so while I Q death

249
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:19,820
every time bad

250
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,560
secret and interpreted

251
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,560
he an interpreter originated by

252
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:54,749
up

253
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,050
