1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,000
for clearly someone thought that I
wasn't drunk enough

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,170
and they were willing to help thank you
whoever you are

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,420
and up a big gamble on my way now so

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,570
nobody's wanna be living right um

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,869
you should really feel you on a British

6
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:22,899
you get shit rate for it like an exploit
is worth more than a lovely day

7
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:26,470
we should all know this by now and

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,899
and exploit framework opposed
exploitation framework

9
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,690
if well more than an exploit at the
wallabee so

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,710
basically shuffling thumping go for the
fourth expedition framework being

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,660
and I'm sure few people in the audience
would agree other than that

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,890
the Thomas thank you very much I

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,089
I but I'm I have a few

14
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:53,359
I have few recommendations based
tradition for me to come next year

15
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,390
I think it'll be fair that if you want
to see if the audience want to see a

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,420
speaker talk

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,589
for another 10 minutes every month no
dent repair shop

18
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:06,100
it back or defect upping the BART

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,990
upping the bike alright Joey thank you
