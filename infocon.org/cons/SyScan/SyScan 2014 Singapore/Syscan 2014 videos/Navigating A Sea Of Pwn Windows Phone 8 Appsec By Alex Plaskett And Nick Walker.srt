1
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:03,389
thanks for coming up buddy hope it went
on MLK I am

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,870
I'm Nick Walker this mccauley going to
POSCO talk about Windows Phone 8 so

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,870
up what what is Windows Phone 8s

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,950
Microsoft's latest mobile offering I
with certain

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:21,540
significant changes since Windows Phone
7 I ask only third position in market

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,940
share with quite a small

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,230
share overall as far as percentages go I
am

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,950
with Android obviously covering most the
market I was being a

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:35,330
I am pop only more and more applications
are here in the market

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,080
as a lot tougher ongoing development
from big corporations try a hot stock to

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,730
the market

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,010
something to a the market shares going
to increase quite quickly over the

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,160
coming months and years

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,890
I am and on top it up a lot of

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,430
I am enterprises Akali tryna and roller

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,690
and users a copper platform but which
will also draw a picture

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:02,489
I am as far as developer documentation
security however there's not that much

18
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,909
I while Ms De Anza really great source
for

19
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,310
functional went development information
how to write

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,750
a functional application there's not a
law

21
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,310
as far as security documentation there's
a lot surfaced of like kind of

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,010
Ste general recommendations on what to
do buspar Senegalese the API's is really

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,830
nothing at all

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,900
I so this talk Cup

25
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,880
aims to address this problem from two
angles one things the developers to

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,350
watch out for when you develop into
Windows Phone application

27
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,020
and two hot form as a security assessor

28
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,600
a Windows Phone application assessment
so

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,570
are given to a rundown of what we're
gonna talk a lot and general so we'll

30
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,479
talk a lot about

31
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,610
about the background of Windows Phone 8
and how it differs from Windows Phone 7

32
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,460
up home assessment a box assessment
marketplace applications

33
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,689
was required in the assessment how to
address

34
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,170
witnesses been found in the platform
also discuss

35
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,330
public research originated from the
jailbreak seen

36
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,119
and their impact on applications carry a
Windows Phone

37
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,950
8 I am took a little bit about

38
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,950
local data protection application some
boxer local data storage

39
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,340
love about encryption also discuss

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,260
a both Ligia might be /c mechanisms
available to users

41
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,469
and how to use them securely and also
discuss some

42
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:30,139
public not so legit my PC methods have
been scuppered

43
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:33,559
I that kind of open open those one
applications to

44
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:36,959
a security issues and office a little
bit

45
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,620
no talk to be complete without a little
bit of Temple validation so all covered

46
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,099
up

47
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,159
so

48
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,290
a little bit more about when those funny
background its arm

49
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,499
originally but a Windows Phone 7 as was
based on

50
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:54,909
when those competition colonel when dust
bunnies no longer based on 10 see

51
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:58,139
I miss the most of attire for the dust

52
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:03,599
desktop wasn't the last one the NT
Kernel in comparison to

53
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,609
Windows Phone 7 much just remove the
restriction the only

54
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:11,029
OM's can run native goat and now a
third-party developers

55
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:14,359
have access to that apostle nice post
one among its code is in

56
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:17,900
donuts a law native code isn't C-plus
possum 10

57
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,480
when Artie is also possible to write
pasting of five applications but also

58
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,579
backed by the

59
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,049
Munish see shot layer ensemble so

60
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,499
due to the move to the NT Kernel they
the security model is based on

61
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:37,169
standard anti security primitives such
as tokens ACLs

62
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:40,269
on it some the somewhat similar to metro
to stock up

63
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,559
Applications Inc up containers I which
are

64
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:47,189
influenced by the I capabilities that
your application

65
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:51,620
requests in the application manifest so

66
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,629
when you develop in Windows Phone a
application

67
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:57,879
but this is kind of the a screen you'll
see

68
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,680
and Visual Studio eyes just I'm just put
this up to kind of show you

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,569
the structure a lot about structural
Windows Phone application song its

70
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,680
top right all the aspects of the
application the

71
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,659
once highlight is the up manifest which
defines

72
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,430
a various config options about your
application similar to the manifest to

73
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,380
get on Android

74
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,850
platform your request she capabilities

75
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,900
and and I alright BC mechanisms are
kinda defined in a

76
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,930
I am on top about you of

77
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,520
the da sample files which are basically

78
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,400
XML files and define the user interface
I am

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,990
is also aspects about the confined I'll

80
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,830
at the waist up the interface ties into
the sea chocolate underneath

81
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,220
and not see underneath that you going to
dot CS files in drives

82
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:55,040
that the actual see shaman is called the
drug application

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,460
so I am these are the core security
controls that you get access to

84
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,350
on I Windows Phone 8 will cover those in
more detail laying

85
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,440
standard some boxing coat sign in you
explain migrations

86
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,870
so some books in itself on the way that
the the actual security models

87
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,950
derived is I some options based on not
contain a model

88
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,430
which excuse ops in separately privilege
containers

89
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,450
which are provisioned runtime: based on
their positions at their request

90
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,820
so you got a trusted computing base the
TCB

91
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,160
I which is basically day execution
contact for all trust that coats ok I'll

92
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,930
coat

93
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,090
I and the lease perles chamber
underneath is where I am

94
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,560
all application that's cute lot new OS
components and drivers any

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,630
possibly less that don't need to be ron
is really hyper alleged

96
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,000
on the dentist early spring Liz chamber
to produced a talk service

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,920
base they all use a long list of runs in
the least privilege chamber where

98
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,230
possible

99
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,340
I reduce the attack serviceapril it's
cold I

100
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,430
needs as much as possible into these Lee
least privileged chambers

101
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,700
so these chambers have provisioned a a
wrong time to your application based on

102
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,420
the

103
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,530
a capabilities the application request
so it's a %um

104
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,900
request access to the SD card or

105
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,830
I am send and I'll go into some asses
those will be applied to the container

106
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,250
when the content start

107
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,590
and these capabilities are also called
down to the filesystem

108
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,750
and registry access is also a overstreet
is an

109
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,910
this technique so they still dollars
down through this I am

110
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,860
contain a model so there are a few

111
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,320
differences however one year consider in

112
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,570
how applications deployed so the
security restrictions apply to an

113
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,640
optician

114
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,250
depend on how the application actually
put on Sat device

115
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,900
so thus to age can do it you can install
on top of the market place

116
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,300
we can develop for unlock your phone on
site loaded up the patient

117
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,600
so applications aside loaded face

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,800
less restrictions when you're in some
box and not

119
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,010
site loaded up with haitians can modify
and other side the lead

120
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,070
loaded up addition some books directory
include in

121
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,320
their at the install location up
honorees so

122
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,490
a siloed application actually modify the
code of another sign a lot of attention

123
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,280
so you have to consider when you test
inside look it up it's not necessarily

124
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,240
representative

125
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,650
of an application deployed marketplace
state sauce

126
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,770
something's consider when you do an
application test

127
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,139
so as far as code signing those I am all

128
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,850
OS components assigned by Microsoft
which of the G standard

129
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,610
Tampa protection reduces your talk
surface for mahler

130
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,770
and restricted privilege escalation so
that you can be sure that when you

131
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,030
applications run in a container its the

132
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,440
environment same know inside code will
run

133
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,139
I am all marketplace applications must
be signed

134
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,710
in order to be installed I am on a non
develop from what device

135
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,050
a slight differences when you do talking
about develop from

136
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,720
device so

137
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,760
the actual sign in the marketplace
applications occurs not before goes up

138
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,460
to the up

139
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,490
up to the marketplace pot jury in the
marketplace and Justin process

140
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,650
I am up point all the

141
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,930
applications able to marketplace also
protected use an

142
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,919
play ready DRM I'll which is then
stripped

143
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,050
once installed onto about device

144
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,930
so the coat sign in seems to have a few

145
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,329
discrepancies not really go entirely to
the bottom of

146
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:41,339
I so native among his coat seem
different effected

147
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,800
post-installation up a with post
inflation Parchin

148
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,439
so tamper with money coat a seems to
work fine

149
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:52,749
you can a staunch got accessed I am so
far system

150
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:56,029
which also more about getting later you
can modify

151
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,420
the dotnet and applications run just
fine

152
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,829
any modifications native code cause a up
to crush

153
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:06,069
I so as a useful tool when you talking
about doing

154
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:09,379
functional testing for things I
certificate been in in

155
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:12,720
cut the more secure applications

156
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,910
but it's a new dawn echoed can patch it
on a problem carry on with the test and

157
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,279
if you're in a Mon its coat done if you
and sorry in native code and in a

158
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,480
struggle and it's gonna just crush on

159
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,879
so we're trying to get Obama currently
in its miss something with looking at

160
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,740
the moment

161
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,269
so obviously would have been mature
platform

162
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,249
you've got standards a explanation
protections are you expect to see on

163
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:41,410
all the other platforms like I S a law

164
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:46,300
a annex unstuck cookies

165
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,499
so as far as encryption goes a

166
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:52,699
does support full device encryption off
for some reason

167
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:55,959
s not available for personal use so if
so your personal

168
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,449
Windows Phone 8 device it does no UI
option not

169
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:02,829
way to access in the UI to enable full
device encryption

170
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,639
I and i can only be enabled when you and
rolled device into a corporate

171
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,649
environment

172
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,920
I am for personal users our there is

173
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,879
something called the Data Protection API
which is it can be used to encrypt

174
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,329
specific pieces a day a last last up to
the developer of those applications to

175
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,300
be used as a

176
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,889
San API available when on the developers
write the application itself

177
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:28,889
I the some issues with the PAPI the talk
about later

178
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:32,740
I you should be aware these

179
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,470
so p

180
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,579
in the contacts a normal market place
applications a

181
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:43,339
because %uh some box your cigar a no
access

182
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:47,740
to I application another stations de Oro
binaries

183
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,149
I marketplace downloads pipe and SSL

184
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,209
like Windows Phone 7 well on Windows
Phone 7 that

185
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:58,059
sniffs the connection between the
marketplace and the phone and pulled the

186
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:01,819
a sup the in application installation
file from the stream

187
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:06,509
with no DRM aunt extract on to black box
us the application that waste are

188
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:10,139
that's not there is on the Windows Phone
8 marketplace

189
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,529
manual download and install option which
lunch spot the

190
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:16,879
sup itself down what is up saw strength
from the marketplace

191
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,569
stepped onto the SD card phone and
install a device

192
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:24,569
baugh the is up itself obviously still a
player to dr. a monthly installed the

193
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:25,949
device

194
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:28,949
so you can just extra coat and take a
look I

195
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:33,529
you first install to the bus so does
this mean that you can't

196
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,009
black box assassin and a nap because not
just the coat

197
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,339
well fortunately some volumes of

198
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:45,509
slipped up Malout I am was to break the
some books

199
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:49,619
so on the a tu vez a on the XT forums

200
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:52,689
there's attack a wolf us

201
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:56,189
a got full false as much as the heir to
the synthesis

202
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:59,990
how it's done so there's a capability
called

203
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,059
I D cup interrupt services I am which

204
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,470
Acer so capable in your quest as an OEM

205
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,819
to provide slightly high level of access
so the device functionality

206
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,910
so things like change in the registry I
am

207
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,050
you can do with the capability I am

208
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,059
says functionally compromise the
security model

209
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:24,399
this problem so for more info about the

210
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,920
this capability itself not covered up im
much detail here

211
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,110
Kosovo recovered Alex already covered up
a previously

212
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,790
now look at the a research the word on
into Windows Phone 7

213
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,790
a t just google so that will find

214
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,819
so the up the sums on a2 thats

215
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:48,300
house a diagnostic application which
isn't directly accessible

216
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,619
I am it's a hidden up which is used for
I'm sure was used for debugging a

217
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:55,809
development I'm it contains up on I'm

218
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:59,360
big puncher functionally including a
registry at a his office he got the

219
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,610
captain Sourav services capability

220
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,079
so the Reg Treader is an accessible
through any in the face

221
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,269
at all there's no waited directly up to
Sir

222
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,499
I am bought through phone bill a little
discuss later

223
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:15,619
I am the at a can be called directly

224
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:18,850
on opened to make gradual changes

225
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,209
so these two registry keys all the
registry keys that say

226
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:25,220
which user and

227
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,079
a day a directory the anti-peace service

228
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,550
so that's false from so you

229
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,160
do the issue the exploit the
vulnerability to a little talk about it

230
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,309
in a bit and modify these registry case
to change the NTP service to run system

231
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:44,329
not such a mess that they had our itself
from the router

232
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:48,649
C Drive rather than just standard user
pictures and profile

233
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,339
pitches and videos doughtery restart the
phone

234
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,809
negotiable filesystem at to see its best
system

235
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:00,220
so 19 see everything on the phone I you

236
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,259
can go start taking a look up the that
sucks up as a

237
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,329
marketplace applications installed gonna
look in that

238
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:10,129
application install path which is
available on the

239
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:13,779
cedar programs and then a GUID the GUID
he's

240
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:16,809
on Nazi Krupp if you go to the
marketplace on

241
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:20,199
on on a web browser and search for the
application

242
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:23,290
the GUID for the opposite actually in
the URL

243
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,279
for the application seeking just extra
I'll get off to go

244
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,829
surgent fine I am

245
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,939
people of all your money is done they
have coats and install reverse unlike

246
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,959
any other blood loss assessment you
doing another

247
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:41,679
I am mobile device and fine is awesome
bonobos

248
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,959
so few little side notes I am

249
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,649
welcome from been removed or any for a
moment

250
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:53,079
con functionally from Anne the device
isn't much to look up

251
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,480
I am it's still possible to restore this

252
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,519
in the a .contacttable Oprah container

253
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,429
because the windows the win files the
windows update files

254
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:07,290
actually contain the book signed
versions of town Ackman prompt

255
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,600
and FTP you just let rip struck these
from the

256
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,660
I when file package in with your
application install these

257
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,489
ops I'm you can't really do much with
obviously because you unleash perles

258
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:19,069
chamber

259
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:25,149
paw is a stock future work

260
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,259
sauna talk about local de protection now

261
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:32,369
I am go over the dept action API

262
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:35,869
so was a dick de papi has been in
Windows

263
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:40,160
has been in Windows sewing since a when
those two thousand

264
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,399
s designed to be as simple as possible I
am

265
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,449
it's used in a bunch when those tools
shoe store you wifi passwords

266
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:51,449
Saudi he credits I am and its little is
too much that's

267
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:54,839
encrypt a 2.2 lol you'll protect which
takes a

268
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,129
plain text law on wall TV but cipher
text

269
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:02,389
on on protect obviously does a reverse
so that's that

270
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:05,889
that's what's the native methods are
protected lol

271
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:09,299
but that you can also act as a botnet
left to access those and I

272
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,749
system DAW crypto system that's carried
opera talk with the doc

273
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:17,319
attacked data class I am its

274
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,790
a yes 2226 encrypt it blobs quite
literally only deals with the

275
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,730
and corruption and decryption it does
not say deal with any storage o'clock

276
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,589
today subsidize I left up to the
developers to

277
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,860
stall that they are properly

278
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,019
so abs workout that stop on desktop it
works

279
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,439
differently to the phone so on a desktop
the keys are derived from the user

280
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:42,319
credential

281
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:46,149
is in PB KDF to a per-user keys

282
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:49,179
a derived installed and filesystem onto
the set

283
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:53,160
not in the updated directory which means
because you've got to use a key

284
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,299
you can access and all the users that
are not contact source: someone uses

285
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,379
I am application these is adept at right

286
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:04,160
dept action API's one user eight starts
a McRib today it does

287
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,810
even northern same filesystem able to
access the files they cannot see the

288
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,640
crib but there because the context

289
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,990
is different Adams a and Krypton

290
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,240
there's a a caveat to this and not this
alls

291
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,270
you can specify a flock when used the
name a player

292
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,780
a to encrypt the locals and prefer the
local system teamster the user

293
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,890
contacts key which means a as he is the
key then

294
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,370
any is on the local system can access it
it sounds

295
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,630
so on the phone slightly

296
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,540
different and whether keys are stored
stored on those dark tuzla

297
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,730
but the issue is the among we're not
sure whether it's because a run on the

298
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,510
same music

299
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,780
a user ID but different contexts or

300
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,210
book all applications seem to use the
same drive must the key on the bus

301
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,920
so what location isn't that protection
AP on Windows Phone 8

302
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,870
not saying should they be able to access
that data a

303
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,170
on the only way you can do that is with
the sums on the bus

304
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,170
using the and TP book I

305
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,410
they cannot see just the crypt opticians
daya so should the somewhat be broken in

306
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,400
the future the Data Protection API
tunnel

307
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,280
becomes more the day of the station and
API than anything at all

308
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,950
I'm so something to watch out for work
only because we were only able to test

309
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,490
this

310
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,730
a on the AM Best we don't really know
officer

311
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,120
device specific issue I'm pick up with

312
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,610
one the somewhat it broke on another
device we can confirm

313
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,540
find out

314
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,000
so I can you kinda demonstrate this
issue I'm

315
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,030
we use crypto notes that a mystery as a
really simple de papi up

316
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,420
Corp use the up cope went for to call
tech today up

317
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,110
I'm not safe a block got to blow up you
can rights

318
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,570
rights of a lot location: up I calls on
protect on a

319
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,130
on that block I don't see the copies of
out the somewhat

320
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,090
Prince a somewhat your application just
call the crypt about a plain text

321
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,330
plan and democrats are not supplication

322
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,780
so how do you mitigate against this
issue

323
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,430
well locally the de papi a allows

324
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,650
a second ha sprays to be passed as a
second Brahma

325
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,830
I S base be a developer supplied
extricating was basically does

326
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,000
I a second possibly encryption site uses
the

327
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,120
a much the key father

328
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,950
unser and then Rita read/write City
based on the password is passed and

329
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,330
and the call to protect or attack method
I am

330
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,610
yeah I'm a case against the issue above
sea doc .doc

331
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,680
secondary key is obsolete and securing
critical

332
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,560
and storage atop should probably not be
on the device and should be

333
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,800
store else well got from a web service
securely

334
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,389
K on the Passover to my colleague Thomas

335
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,190
a okay so I'm next talked about the Data
Protection Act II

336
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,620
I'm I'm gonna talk a transmission
security in their data

337
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,080
I'm when it's a transmitted across the
wire

338
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,210
the so I am on Windows Phone a

339
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,490
its parts tell us 1.0 by default

340
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:22,200
and wires like if you compare this to to
Iowa's I wes is on at a last one point

341
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,130
during the latest

342
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,240
as the case so Windows Phone is a little
bit behind them

343
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,290
like that and but there's no there's no
weak ciphers at all supported

344
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,950
on his life is abundant when your pets
are crap and Inc a strat

345
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,710
and the one big problem at the moment is
there's no way to

346
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,500
well on and ride and there's a way to
override certificate checking

347
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,210
and this is a common problem with I'm
dried-up occasions where

348
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,660
they day into they override the
validation function and then

349
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,020
using self-signed certificates than a
the applications per se it's an

350
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,030
acknowledged any upset if carriers

351
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:05,570
and but on Windows Phone there's no
actual way to do this

352
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:11,340
there's no APIs and in the language in
c-sharp are we not see to actually a

353
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,690
disables difficult validation so this is
that this is a good thing

354
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,350
but and also means that you can't do I
things like

355
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,230
client certificates clients to forget
Sasol

356
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,710
am and also for high security
applications as well

357
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,030
and the there's no API's doing pending

358
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,290
because you can't have access to the
certificate chain

359
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,820
than it's really difficult to actually
am

360
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,080
much implementing in Windows Phone 8
applications currently

361
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,240
and but same as well

362
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,290
like there's a lot about the cations at
the moment which

363
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,820
at elder spot which don't use SSL
applications which

364
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,340
you'd really expects the right to be
using SSL

365
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,310
so things like Instagram I'm that do
there

366
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,930
%uh session tokens oh if I i'm up a
cleartext

367
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,020
and and as I mentioned as well that ops

368
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,180
at if they it's a fail to backed then

369
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,140
there's no way to actually proceed after
an SSL Ariza cut

370
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,980
and so I use a car actually arthritis

371
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,820
and so in summary for transmission
security there's not

372
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,850
lot really can survive other than
there's a lot to have control at the

373
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,190
moment by developers

374
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,750
there's no way to specify ciphers
there's no a two-out

375
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,790
override the validation checks and

376
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,790
if you do want to implement pending and
it it's possible to use their commercial

377
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,560
library

378
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,020
and are you cured implemented using
win32 APIs

379
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,590
and the problem with using win32 is

380
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,690
it takes a large amount of fat

381
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,000
if at API calls to actually implement a
cell

382
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,150
and it's quite prone to making mistakes
with the app

383
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,560
with the win32 APIs I'm

384
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,100
so the next season depresses
communication so

385
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,620
inter-process communication on Android
has been a huge saucer

386
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,260
are have security vulnerabilities and
Android applications

387
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,470
at this being like for lotto finder
applications the attack surfaces

388
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,530
at significance and because the eyepiece
and plants which are actually exposed

389
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,790
on them when this finite there's

390
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,410
its HS similarities to write to Iowa's
where

391
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,590
you've only got the prop file a nap
protocol handlers

392
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,850
am to actually implement I P say

393
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,020
so for example like Twitter and like

394
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,250
you can implement at protocol handler

395
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,620
for Twitter at like like the RI bill up

396
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:54,080
so and so to actually implement these
are protocol handlers well

397
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,300
you what you do is you I define them
approach gone lower than the application

398
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,350
manifest

399
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:05,860
at W I'm not money fast to and you could
say a PDF application handles a PDF file

400
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,440
type

401
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,490
RM you could implement sayre a

402
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,100
protocol under like for example threats
are of ice but

403
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,930
and and then you you write that

404
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,530
and my PRI function within our
application which handles the

405
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:25,960
the input from the I am you can also but
these with an hour

406
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,390
within web pages and seek it if you but
the link within a web page it doesn't

407
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,250
actually

408
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,610
provide any props when it when your eyes
triggered

409
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,530
and so unless you've got your
applications which register for the same

410
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,360
yar I

411
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,590
then this automatically fire the
application and damn

412
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,160
pass their parameters passed me Ritu the
a

413
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,720
to the application but no user
interaction required

414
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,790
so this could be a saw Sarah's and

415
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:59,740
from looking at that top IT marketplace
applications it seems that's their

416
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,750
most developers are aware of this and
and this isn't really

417
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,880
at and with not find any vulnerabilities

418
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,710
in this area so far and

419
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,190
so that was the way of doing I am

420
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,460
I've doing the documented I P say

421
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,860
at a space by then amistad but

422
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,340
and this another undocumented way as
well and

423
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,720
which is I've find this time it's called
cross supplication navigation forgery

424
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,750
and and it's essentially faucet
navigation from

425
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,070
one application to another application
and

426
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,470
CPU guy discovered it an issue with
toasts and

427
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,120
were Bob to demonstrate how this can be
used by an attack and how it could be

428
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,510
used to exploit

429
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,560
at Windows Phone applications

430
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,030
so for those in not familiar with
terrorists on

431
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,910
that s that basically it there's a pop
up at the top of that

432
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,390
have the Windows Phone 8 application I'm
and then if the user clicks not post

433
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,470
then it forces a

434
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,830
navigation at to happen seeking

435
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,430
deep link with and application which is
actually triggered the toaster

436
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,290
and say you can link to use that potts
the application

437
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,680
I'm but there's a vulnerability in that

438
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,650
business and documented API method
called shall post message: test

439
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,430
and this essentially I am allows you to
specify the

440
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,390
and and at PRI which specifies which

441
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,610
application has Sam originated the toast

442
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,570
I and the path to the screen with an
application

443
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,750
so this means I'm it can be any samples
grain within the application

444
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,080
am which is allocated to so

445
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,610
it's especially like 100 activities and
borrowing this phone

446
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,080
using this method everything's exported
and there's no way to

447
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,100
lock it down currently and see can
trigger

448
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,600
any is almost green with the application
I'm pass whatever promises you want to

449
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,430
this

450
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,970
to this summer screen as well and so if
there's a problem with in the handling

451
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,890
of their

452
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,710
the have at the promises which best part
is that an attacker could use this to

453
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,900
exploit the application

454
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,070
I'm so I looked its at I start looking
applications to see if I could find any

455
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,540
which we've learned about this type of
attack

456
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,390
and and this is a large a large OEM find
out which

457
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,250
at which needs to remain nameless at the
moment but

458
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,920
and essentially what this does is that
it takes that promises from the RI

459
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,360
I'm dead triggers a just a formative the
fun

460
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,080
just wipes the fun and so this is a

461
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,060
yes it could be abused by an attacker
they also compare the phone into a

462
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,240
automatic on some old as well

463
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,620
so when a call comes through then the
phone automatically accept the call

464
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,110
and and and automatically i connect the
call

465
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,380
I'm so this is a as an issue to
demonstrate this

466
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,730
type talk but really an hour and

467
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,250
in a more realistic scenario would be an
authenticated session

468
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,570
and an in a fog round application and
then a background application cadet

469
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,600
triggered that the text to force their
fall grant application to navigate

470
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,490
at and an exploit the flaw grant
application to do

471
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,590
as a malicious I'm

472
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,400
so my thoughts were well surely surely
Microsoft's

473
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,970
marketplace validation will detect this
kind of thing as well

474
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,670
the serve like and documented APIs and

475
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,900
and and and dynamic at

476
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,500
caught like calling functions at runtime
and but now it seems like he can that

477
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,540
you can use that the object get proper
dress tonight to resolve the function

478
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,380
address

479
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,680
and I'm branch do their branch to that
address

480
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,630
and then this this doesn't get detected
by the marketplace currently

481
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:02,070
and saipan gonna application which was
using this cult pic tiles

482
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,030
and this is a this application doesn't
use any malicious way but it just shows

483
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,970
that the

484
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,970
the marketplace validation isn't it

485
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,330
as good as it could be and I am that
there's doubt

486
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,580
gaps where an attack could potentially
get code on the marketplace

487
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,740
and I say like the risk is quite limited
the attack and its power on the fine to

488
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,350
exploit this issue

489
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,570
and also needs to they lost it means to
be an app which is vulnerable to

490
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,880
to doing something to do something
stupid with the arguments as well

491
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,010
and so how do you protect against this
book basically a

492
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,920
I say this to methods to do this that
the fastest see you have

493
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,550
to require user interaction at the far

494
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,860
the following actions were cut at the
second is implementing something like

495
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,000
cross-site request forgery tokens where

496
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,800
and the another gated from method you
can

497
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,380
I'm generating star a token and then

498
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm and navigate to you can get the
token am

499
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,410
data and validate the token data past

500
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,260
I'm finally s up despite failing to talk
about

501
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,190
input validation and so up and
application security talk it wouldn't

502
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,720
really be complete without talking about
sir

503
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,810
Press scripting so at

504
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,850
essentially if not an attacker can
inject their

505
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,110
JavaScript on Windows Phone 8 that in if
its running at if

506
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,450
in use a web at a WebView

507
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,910
then you can essentially I'm if an
attack a

508
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,460
injects an iframe that can i friend
content within the application some box

509
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,880
and and then use this with Accenture X
about HTTP POST request

510
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,180
I'm experts write the data outside in
the Sun box

511
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,290
and then transmit this back to to remote

512
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:58,900
server I'm another interesting but
ability I found as well while assessing

513
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,420
marketplace applications was that remote
zongol loading

514
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,360
at so samples used to lay out their
d'gary in the application

515
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,280
and define whether controls are actually
laid out on the screen

516
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,260
by fund an advertising up which that
essentially

517
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,970
taxes on all from from a web service up
a cleartext

518
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,790
and unloads the sample into the air into
the local application

519
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,110
sounds like okay well what can you do
with this am

520
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:32,010
so when does on when this presentation
framework you can embed them

521
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:36,809
see shop code with then within zongol
and to get code execution

522
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:41,080
and but on when this but I Microsoft the
respected this

523
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,160
and Xcode an event handlers

524
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,500
they've been removed therefrom from this
on wall

525
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,660
and but I find out you can't instantiate
a web browser control

526
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,680
then you could load remote JavaScript
and

527
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,270
and I never about web and a remote web
site which got JavaScript on and then

528
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,630
spiff the UI

529
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,200
and essentially capture credentials and
get code execution that way

530
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,570
I'm so in summary I

531
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,880
don't download interested concerns
locally

532
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,420
don't take remote concerns load and the
local contacts without performing

533
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,559
validation

534
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,710
and and I don't think I really need to
say this but remote

535
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,300
loadings on wall is a dangerous
functionality like it's not common but

536
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:31,140
could be in future and so in summary I
see why Windows Phone 8 is one of their

537
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,960
well as the strongest mobile platforms
out there the kind of attacks which

538
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,170
we've discovered through our research
and

539
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,890
a mainly though risk issues which an
attacker would need to change together

540
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,430
to actually I'm

541
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,700
perform exploitation and compromise the
fun

542
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,750
well compromise ups on the platform and
but

543
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,800
it shows that like novel novel attack
methods and I'm

544
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,940
at s can still be found ten I'm

545
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,790
and used by an attacker and finally at
the OEM's is still trouble

546
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,190
like an OEM can still compromise their
security of their

547
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,480
of the platform entirely and so your
choice and I am

548
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,840
actually dictates that the security of
Windows Phone 8

549
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,590
I'm phones an upset okay thank you

550
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,360
and so in summary as well I just like to
say thanks to %uh the previous research

551
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,300
which has been profound and

552
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,750
X day farms as well it well a lot of
this

553
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,330
up sex OPSEC research can be out

554
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,340
the phone without that without the tells
and there's also not

555
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,600
there's also white paper which mimic a
Grand Am

556
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,300
which has got a lot more information
about Windows Phone 8 ups

557
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,950
and how to securely writers applications

558
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,590
so there any questions

559
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,090
a have you found that when you install
the

560
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:54,170
birth certificate on the phone does that
reliably work

561
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,080
to just intercept evening with the up
not doing bringing because I've had

562
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,040
issues with that

563
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,470
not working so

564
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:04,740
your a funder sometimes it just

565
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,600
fails and Ty Lee and obviously because
call the load the

566
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,299
and Methods its it's a pain a.m.

567
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,639
up naw its really flaky and I'm not much
to get

568
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,580
working reliably I honestly couldn't
tell you what a detective work in

569
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:24,270
baugh in some connections that will work
some connections of lol I think it's

570
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,929
based around how to develop a cotton
make such a request

571
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:31,409
I think through assert often AP I'll
work on one-way

572
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,139
doesn't mics Obama yet well

573
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,820
on key talk about the capabilities and
is unwilling Android where it's

574
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,000
is said to be in its proper or iowa's
where like later on you get this sorted

575
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,619
that these shoes or I so

576
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,879
the capabilities you request them

577
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,600
a people in team on a fast obviously
same as what an Android

578
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,430
at the club the substantially more
granular then you'd find on

579
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,540
on like an Android on Isla system other
quite

580
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,960
there are lots in a.m. they're a lot
more of them basically

581
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,890
RT gets the higher privilege one's idea
oh and provide is kinda gives you a big

582
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,510
blanket

583
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:14,119
ability on 3dmark ingestion process

584
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:18,910
I it it seems to clear whatever

585
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,190
a capabilities request in the money
first

586
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,910
and then Justin process and then just
analyzed code reassigned what

587
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,230
capabilities you what your code actual
users

588
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,420
so Mark ingestion process kind of class
I love you ask for Sophie awesome more

589
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,930
than you need

590
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,260
it won't give you any or to MPP

591
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,790
thing for the from song back you also
write the filesystem

592
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,890
or only within your local some books yet

593
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,840
you direct point so was up with the FTP
on MTP

594
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,530
MPP and TP yet with MTP get full
fossett's knox's system

595
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:56,619
sorry I thought he was speaking about
using the FTP service from Windows

596
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,590
Update

597
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,540
yet use in anti be bucking a full
read/write access to the entire the

598
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,200
possum

599
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,150
can even but the permit be over

600
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,520
MPPs serbian well no because you

601
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,890
you've got coat sign in which such a run
code a system

602
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:16,320
I am so you've got over you've only got
all system access

603
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,630
for this NTP service can be locally I

604
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,740
so you know what to run coda systems
econ run

605
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,260
the house
