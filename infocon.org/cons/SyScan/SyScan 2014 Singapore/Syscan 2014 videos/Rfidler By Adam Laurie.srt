1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,960
the brackets that that confuse Thomas
for a minute there cuz he thought that

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,970
was when you handle

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,340
site franken the zack is my business
partner

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,620
is in brackets because he's not here
obviously the

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:17,439
so yet we work for a company called
aperture labs

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,279
and up a job is hardware reverse
engineering so we basically

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,439
breaking into stuff we totally stole our
name

8
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,739
from the the game any of you guys play
Portal

9
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,820
yet anyone come on

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,920
seriously okay so we're not we're not
that

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,340
other optional abs but we do get fan
mail from time to time

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,640
the the how well you can reap

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,899
but this is some little kid called
joshua is asking if we make portal guns

14
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,670
which obviously we do but

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,190
unit we don't sell so so

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,190
zack is the hardware guy I'm

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,989
he's heavily involved in the kind of
scary analog he

18
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,479
electronic E-world a.m. up your evil

19
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,299
a.m. he does play a lot with scary
chemical so when we reverse engineering

20
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:12,909
stuff

21
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:17,649
he likes did like drill into chips with
fuming nitric acid and stuff like that

22
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:21,390
I'm so he's in charge it bad smells Inc
scary chemicals

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,750
and if if you know it you'll agree
that's quite a good representation of

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,530
what he looks like them he doesn't have
a doc that's my dog

25
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,049
but and then there's me a.m.

26
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:39,140
I'm on that nice digital side my job is
to compare all those horrible analog

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,140
things into nice bits and bytes so
that's my goal

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,340
always get away from the evil analog
world

29
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,630
and interdigital the soon as possible a
show that seems to be a recurring theme

30
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,159
here

31
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,479
there's a lot of guys like me kinda
software guys they're doing art wary

32
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,340
project

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,729
not really understanding how or why we
get it to work

34
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,149
a.m. so I rely on my partner for that

35
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,159
and he just to live as me electronics
like

36
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,360
it. the digital stuff

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,310
a.m. as Thomas mention I also ground
London Def Con group TC 4420

38
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,069
if you're ever in town the last Tuesday
of the month we know Mimi

39
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:22,580
we have an open meeting at anyone's
welcome to come

40
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,709
speakers particularly a.m. submit your
talks

41
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,959
we have to talk to every month it's
completely free and it's in a pub

42
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,750
so I'm like it the theme the alternate
theme is

43
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,450
drinking a lot so okay so what am I
gonna talk about today

44
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,230
a of it lowers the projects and it's a
software-defined

45
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,599
RFID a basically inspired by software
defined radio

46
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,519
so I'm gonna talk about you know the
kind of thinking behind it

47
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,180
and how we decided to try and apply

48
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,190
software-defined radio thinking to the
world of RFID

49
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,299
might be playing with RFID for a long
time

50
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,799
a.m. but it's always been slightly
dissatisfying

51
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:08,870
you know I'm having to use other peoples
tools other people hardware

52
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,190
and I'm heading limitations what we can
do with it so

53
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,200
this was like to try and break out of
that that

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,409
jail and why we doing it well

55
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,720
even though I've been talking about this
stuff for more years than

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,860
you know if I care to remember
manufacturers are still pushing this

57
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,760
crap out

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,090
the they're still physical security
systems that are completely insecure

59
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:39,080
the the tools for demonstrating in
securities or researching in securities

60
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,480
are pretty expensive

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,560
the the best on out there is is probably
the proxmox 3

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,569
the it's a very very good tool but its

63
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,010
fragile it's easy to to brick it
basically

64
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,530
and is pretty expensive it's about 400
bucks by the time you

65
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,569
but want to gather input antennas and
sold with a

66
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,939
'em the alternative is to

67
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:08,790
to look at a.m. so it specifically
talking here about 12 access control

68
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,870
cards for going into buildings and soul

69
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,819
the and the alternative is to look at
the development kits that come from the

70
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,430
manufacturers themselves

71
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,560
the and again

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,400
that they're expensive and that they
generally locked into a single type so

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,890
you can't do much with the excep-
research one particular tactile

74
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,140
what we want to do is change that

75
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,250
disrupt the market change the landscape

76
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,800
make it easy for people to just pick the
stuff up

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,220
stop playing with it and prove that the
systems that are out there

78
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,350
are actually not fit for purpose anymore
and they need to

79
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,260
to change

80
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,010
so when I first started looking into I
found it really confusing and people

81
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,600
still

82
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,750
you know when I talk to people power of
Atty people to find it very confusing

83
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,740
a.m. lot to different standards out
there love its proprietary so they don't

84
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,310
publish details how it all works

85
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,940
the you think you're buying one brand
it's actually another brand with a

86
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,940
slight tweak and a change to the

87
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,550
the name or whatever and one of the
first kind of starting point circle the

88
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,570
misconception is

89
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,130
the that it's not even RFID

90
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,900
RFID stands for radio frequency
identification but there is no radio

91
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,430
involved

92
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,830
what you actually happens inductively
coupled oils talking to each other

93
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,760
the and there's no radio I mean there is
radio in some systems but in most what

94
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,060
we're talking about there is no way to
know

95
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,590
the am the data part of it when you
start looking at what date is actually

96
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,440
being transferred between

97
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,040
the reader in the tank it only becomes

98
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,510
digital like right at the end of the
path so every reader

99
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,050
tends to have a circuit that
specifically designed to read that

100
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,870
particular attack type:

101
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,630
and then at the end you get a digital
stream so it's difficult to use

102
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,460
or impossible to use one reader to read
somebody else's

103
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,510
tax so again

104
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,430
you know how can we change all that

105
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,880
so we went to the idea of
software-defined radio so

106
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,580
in software-defined radio basically that
the actual

107
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,520
over-the-air transmission and reception
is done in hardware

108
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,900
but everything be on that first step is
done in

109
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,340
in software it's all the modulation that
the modulation

110
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,170
filtering whatever you want to do mixing
channels whatever goes in software

111
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,340
sale circuit is pretty simple and you do
you have a most powerful process so that

112
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,190
then

113
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,020
processes the signal and does everything
else for you

114
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,520
so I use a thing called a fun cube a.m.
its

115
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,440
it was designed to go with a satellite
project so they're these keep satellites

116
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,060
the get launched into space

117
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,380
the pretty cheap i think is about thirty
grant

118
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,160
but a cute together the whole buncha get
launched together

119
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,010
so universities and things do these
projects and this was a

120
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,910
project where they put a satellite up in
space and its

121
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,920
the students to to experiment with

122
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,670
I'm receiving signals and processing
signals

123
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,780
so it covers everything from 150
kilowatts to about 2 gigahertz

124
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,750
really powerful tool I use it a lot
other stuff as well

125
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,600
buy cheap I think they're about 75 films

126
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,760
and it works with new radio so if you
gonna play with

127
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,860
a.m. software defined radio and you
don't want to actually understand

128
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,140
software defined radio like me I don't
care

129
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,620
I just want the digital the

130
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,950
new radios a great tool because it it
just gives you building blocks

131
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,530
so you can say okay I've got a fun
cuba's my source

132
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,880
I'm get the take its out but to a bit of
conversion to change the number to a

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,480
suitable for work to go to my sound card

134
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,110
and two away for so I can now tune it to
whatever frequency received some

135
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,510
sailed stick it in the way fall and

136
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm on my way to getting actual digital
date

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,730
so here's an example just tuned it to
whatever frequency captured some

138
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,540
audio the and we can see straight away
that this isn't

139
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,160
audio the you know it's too structured

140
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,169
the it's not in at the latest

141
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,330
pop soul which it could be my only
source could meet with

142
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,599
a.m. so yes just it's clearly

143
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,730
not musical if resume in

144
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,900
we see this so basically you've got

145
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,420
impulses and some silence little pulse

146
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,530
silence little pulse pilot this is an
amplitude modulation

147
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,630
so where he with increasing and
decreasing amplitude at the signal

148
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,220
in this case is going from all to
nothing

149
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,540
so that's what's known as all of King so
we just sending little bursts of

150
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,260
have traffic let's a a.m.

151
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,690
slash oh okay on-off keying

152
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,250
so now I know it's a.m. you know it's
obviously recognizable as AM

153
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,260
the that much ado nobel and looks tough

154
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,760
I can change my a numeric conversion to
an actual d modulator so can the radio

155
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,620
has a building block

156
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,940
there were taken AM signal converter to
something more sensible

157
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,280
so it's gonna d modulate the AM for me
so if I run it through the

158
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,410
now look at the signal again

159
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,240
start to get something that looks more
like a a day to trace

160
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,960
K so still a bit wobbly but at this
point

161
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,140
is it it's in a way far so way fathers
just a header and a buncha numbers

162
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,920
so I can write a bit a python takes that
way farther processes the numbers

163
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,760
so in this case I just say okay
everything that's below zero

164
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,380
becomes mind us 30 2011 ng that's above
zero becomes plus those

165
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,600
2000 or whatever and I converted into a
nice clean

166
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
square way so now

167
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,610
with very little effort we've got actual
rotator

168
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,610
we've pulled out using software defined
radio we've now got

169
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,440
something that we can turn into a bit
stream

170
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,980
so if we look at that and we want to
convert it to a bit stream

171
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,330
just take the shortest pulse say okay
that's our pulse width

172
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,500
if its high it's the one if its lowest 0
simple as that

173
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,670
that's double with first to one's

174
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:48,670
so bingo we're now into binary and I'm
happy

175
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,070
so that's how software-defined radio
works

176
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,240
so can we apply that RFID

177
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,490
why not so similar thing the reader is
generating

178
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,580
125 killer hurts carry away

179
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,690
the tag when it's placed in the reduc-
field

180
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,110
the car I'll get energized because
they're inductively coupled

181
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:19,760
tight wakes up takes its power from the
core

182
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,440
the tag communicates back to the reader
by grounding its core I'll

183
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,030
so because the calls for inductively
coupled anything the tag does to its

184
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,650
call will affect that the recall

185
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,240
so if it short it's call out there's
gonna be a voltage drop in the recall

186
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,110
I'll

187
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,370
the reader can detect that so here we
are tyke is signaling

188
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,620
and we can see the effect that the tag
is happening on the

189
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,440
the carrier that the readers a.m.
generated

190
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,660
on the other side if the reader wants to
talk to the tag he can just simply stop

191
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,930
sending a carrier

192
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,470
the take notice is this gap and says
okay

193
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,570
I'm I'm seeing a message and what the

194
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,180
the tag does is it measures the whip
that these pulses and that

195
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:12,080
pulses the a one or a0

196
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,460
so again we're back to a SK and I okay

197
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,880
so the reader with energize its call is
all

198
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,990
or when it's no

199
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,100
its of when the tax grounding its coil
it's all

200
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,900
or it's not top so exactly the same
principle of key

201
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:38,480
the so one other things I found really
confusing when I started all this is it

202
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,520
ok I can understand a SK thats

203
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,660
pretty simple

204
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,100
and that's all there seems to be if you
look at the the low-level

205
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,510
that there's nothing else you could
really do you can you can grab you call

206
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,190
a doc went to call you could energize
the field or not

207
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,540
enjoys the field that's that's it

208
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,779
so how do we end up with all these other
things PWM FSK PSK

209
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:06,960
Manchester and so so like I said I found
that really

210
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,540
really puzzling so if we look at each of
those modulation schemes we've already

211
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,170
done

212
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,350
SK that's easy so when the norse

213
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:23,350
wieder ground like all Auto Group Co

214
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,730
and if you run that through

215
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,029
at the modulator and take away the
carrier you end up with a signal that

216
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:31,160
looks like that

217
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,230
so highs and lows same as mine money

218
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,910
way tho squarely and again

219
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,970
we can just split up into one single

220
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,320
whitney's

221
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,640
Manchester encoding is just the same
thing only you adding another layer

222
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,720
so for each bit instead of

223
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,040
keeping your your I'm modulator running
the same as the tater

224
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,270
you actually modulate halfway through
the pulse

225
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,850
so a while becomes a 0 or low high

226
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:11,650
and his era becomes a high-low or vice
versa

227
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,970
now this is quite magic because it
actually adds

228
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,720
the layer to the data so you can use it

229
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,420
because the Oni valid them bitstream

230
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,589
within Manchester is either a 10 for a
while

231
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,630
or $0.01 poussiere if you see a 1-1

232
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,710
thats invalid and if you see a 0-0
that's a valid

233
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:41,430
and that helps you because for example
in this bitstream we started with the 11

234
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,820
so that's inviolate so what do we do

235
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,170
basically we just skipped off a bit so
we

236
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,050
literally throw away that first one so
if we divide the day top into pairs

237
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,860
week at 1101 the world one is invalid so
throw away the First World

238
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,529
skip off a bit in New now got only valid
pairs

239
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:07,770
so that means we synchronized ourselves
to the transmitters clock so we now know

240
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,850
where the beginning a puppet period is

241
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:16,190
so that's thats achieved quite useful
function for us

242
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,480
it also allows us to detect errors so
the first there was an error it's just

243
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,550
because we started reading of a bit of

244
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,790
but if we see another 11 or another 00

245
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,250
then we know we've seen an era so we've
actually got a bit stream air

246
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,790
the you also get the ability to actually
transmitters era

247
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,339
if you do if you remember the original a
SK

248
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:41,990
as 0 was just an absence of signal so
what's the difference between

249
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,899
me not transmitting and me transmitting
a thousand zeros

250
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,649
there isn't one but with Manchester you
can achieve transmitter 0 because his

251
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,830
era is actually a 01

252
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,850
so again useful facility

253
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,250
okay by phase space above the any
differences

254
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,100
you only modulate in that way for a
while

255
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,500
if it's a zero you just flipped a bit

256
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,240
but keep same throughout that period

257
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,330
so here's where it gets clever so FSK

258
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,250
frequency shift keying what you actually
do

259
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,210
is your modulate the signal in the same
way but you just do it much more

260
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,570
frequently

261
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:32,080
and you do it at a different rate
depending if you're sending a one or a0

262
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,740
so we can know weekend aground Oct oil
multiple times during the period

263
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,940
and for what we do it very quickly and
40 we do it's like

264
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,029
slower and that has the effect if you
run it through our

265
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:52,260
the modulator of creating a patent like
this so the carriers breaking through

266
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,660
for a short period and then it's being
squashed

267
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,720
and then it's coming through again and
so and you can see you have things bikes

268
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,020
and you have thick spikes so that's an
FSK

269
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,839
so it magically generated FSK using a SK

270
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,010
on top of an existing carrier

271
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,589
which was a revelation to me sweater
that's how it works

272
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,140
but was easy

273
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,179
so this is a diagram showing this is
when I'm dampening so the red is without

274
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:23,980
doubt

275
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,120
and that the Black Caps as well or not
and you can see the carrier

276
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:35,120
just coming through in and it'll burst

277
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,059
and to convert that back to date so we
just can't the spikes so within our pit

278
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,320
period

279
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,580
if we get 6 short pulses it so 0 and if
we get five little ones it so well

280
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,690
but simple

281
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:57,059
the SK phase shift keying so phase shift
keying is where

282
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,830
you your modulating away when you want
to signal an event

283
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,870
you you change your face so in this case
you just pose

284
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,170
for an extra period so if you're
currently don't you just step for

285
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,540
another period

286
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,950
and if you're about to undergo for
another period

287
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,059
and that has this affect when I first so
this is like

288
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:21,110
woohoo what the hell is that

289
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,480
and basically what's happening is
because you're

290
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,059
dampening it like 50 percent of the rate
up the original carrier

291
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,059
this carriers trying to burst through so
if

292
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:35,460
if we were not typed it although there
was no the

293
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,470
tag in the field the lines would go all
the way from the top to the bottom and

294
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,370
it would just be a

295
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,590
a big solid bar what's happening is
during this period with damping it for

296
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,559
half the time so the carrier gets about
half way up

297
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,610
and then it gets squashed minute heads
down and it gets cold

298
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:57,550
whenever we both delay it burst through
for just one period so you get the

299
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,550
spikes either high or low

300
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,540
so the pink bit is where where damping
for hot 50 percent to the time

301
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,760
the red pits where we fully don't the
black pits where where

302
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,059
under so you can see you get a spike
coming through it some don't

303
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:19,420
or drop it to the bottom when it's fully
don't

304
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:26,420
soak in it kinda makes sense when you
understand what's going on

305
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:32,770
and to convert that to data you simply
measure your pet period

306
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,510
and whenever there's a spike he flipped
the pit so if

307
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,670
if there's no change if this was a one
that's just one world one world one

308
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,870
well we hope it comes a zero 0011

309
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:50,870
1100 so again really easy to convert
back to digital

310
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,590
and as I mentioned earlier on the other
way around when the tag

311
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,540
when the reader wants to talk to the tag
it just does

312
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,150
pulse widths so if at pulse is a1 then
pulses 0

313
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,900
the and what it's doing is just
switching off its carrier

314
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,950
so the the the tag has a little
capacitor in it that allows it to store

315
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,020
some energy so even though the carrier
is turned off

316
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,970
the tag doesn't die the has enough
energy to

317
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,049
to survive that little cap and carry on
to the next

318
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,900
polls

319
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,720
okay so that's the low-level basics a.m.

320
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,240
now we can look at the actual date so
what's being said across

321
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,330
between the reader and the tech so
generally most tax

322
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,260
a passive you stick it in or at least at
this frequency

323
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,290
125 killer hot stuff that we're looking
at is take the reader into the field

324
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,780
it spits Apple ID it just start barfing
outnumbers

325
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,190
the even if it's in cryptid

326
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,790
so there's a at a standard the golden
dollar

327
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:07,490
and basically it's they just take the
content that they would normally say and

328
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,480
and they encrypt it and then they said
that but it's still the same thing

329
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,480
so a replay of that data will work just
as well

330
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,830
as a replay by dialing cryptid stream so
it literally is about as secure as a

331
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,640
barcode you might as well just print a
number on a piece of paper

332
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,640
the hold up to the reader and the reader
recognizes the number lets you in

333
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,890
active tags on the other hand there's a
two-way communication

334
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,490
so spit out I D

335
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,510
the and then the reader will based on
that I T

336
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,890
issue a challenge they might do a
two-way authentication

337
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,400
the and that's more secure but it's only
a secure as the underlying crypto

338
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,309
so high tech to for example has been
broken for a couple years

339
00:21:56,309 --> 00:22:00,500
the that's far as far as I'm aware is
not broken

340
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,870
the they're awesome particular attack
sorry we

341
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:07,929
we've actually recovered keys from
systems that were badly implemented but

342
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,700
the test by tax themselves

343
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:15,340
port

344
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,080
so the thing we've designed is called of
fiddler this is the low-frequency

345
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,040
version

346
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,299
the the plan was to make it very cheap

347
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,679
the make it very easy to use quite
powerful

348
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,150
useful as a stand-alone device so you
can just plug it in and use it you don't

349
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,020
need a whole lotta process or anything

350
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,220
the and what it does is it provides you
with the analog

351
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,559
the circuit that does the initial a SK
and then everything else is done in

352
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,760
in topper we did the Kickstarter project
to fund it

353
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,020
the to achieve this was the original
price

354
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,420
point that we wanted so we were aiming
for 30 quid

355
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,840
like all these projects we just called
matter that more and more features to it

356
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,179
as we go along so

357
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:08,440
that touchy probably gonna go up but a

358
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,210
it's also going to be entirely
open-source 0 the software is open

359
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,160
source

360
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,380
the the circuit design is Creative
Commons

361
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,179
so your belts just download it build it
yourself you don't have to give us

362
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:26,110
anything or you can pay us what it's
going to cost us to build them

363
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:32,250
which will probably be about 100 bucks
Union kick-start is close by the way so

364
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,170
a.m. we're about to go into a hoe plain
talk first production run

365
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:40,049
the so there will be some left over from
from that

366
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:45,380
so we will be sticking them on the
website for sale

367
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,600
so this is the plan that should be able
to use any modulation scheme

368
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,390
should do by directional Pro two goals
should be able to read a tag right

369
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,179
attorney Eric

370
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,700
emulator make Smith conversations
between

371
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,700
taken reader the

372
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:07,700
as I said be totally stand-alone easy to
use

373
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,340
tight types it already knows about and
can deal with

374
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:17,169
the a.m. for 102 zip a common type type

375
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:20,320
achieve these guys as well as the first
ones I have a cloned

376
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,970
at I publish a RFID library called

377
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,179
RF idiot and

378
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:32,200
I have tools in there for cloning knees
the onto a key for life which is

379
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,210
a a very flexible tight tight that you
can reprogram to emulate other tanks

380
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,260
'em these are very very common and
strangely

381
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,540
that the most common in alarm systems so
if you're in the UK and you have a

382
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,380
monitored alarm system

383
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,600
the police will only respond to your
alarm system

384
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,900
if you use an RFID tag to to

385
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,440
into the building and switch the
allowable if you use a pin

386
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,660
you cannot sign up to have police
monitoring

387
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:10,020
so they mandate it has to be up this old
with an RFID tag

388
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:15,020
and the RFID tag type that's most
commonly used as a nearby 402

389
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,980
which is trivially clone a ball and
generally comes in the shape of a key

390
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,440
fob

391
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,130
which will be on your keyring so when
you lose your keys you lose your

392
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:27,250
pope and solo can just pick them up the
walk into a building in turn your loan

393
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,370
officer

394
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:35,330
it's a great idea well done the police

395
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,870
k so house of where to find is of it
looked

396
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,950
basically as a set the the the hard way
it does

397
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,040
just the as- K the modulation for you

398
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,490
everything else after that is done

399
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,929
by the chip including generating the
carrier

400
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,290
lemme the modulating FSK PSK

401
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,880
Manchester PWM whatever

402
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,880
so the only bit that the circuit houses
a SK

403
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,730
so here we have an example the fiddler's
getting

404
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,140
this is the signal generated by the Pask
circuit

405
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,360
and this is actually a PSK signal coming
in

406
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,360
so the the up and i own pulse is a

407
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,590
both converted to ups so we have to do
is to take the A

408
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,470
where there's an upturn we've got a
spike and then we process

409
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,600
into a bit tree

410
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,620
we can also emulate so what if the home

411
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,580
all the things I found quite frustrating
I mean I'm a great fan of the prop smoke

412
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,890
as as anyone here actually used to prop
small or have approx book

413
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,650
beauty okay so one other things

414
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:59,429
a.m. I find frustrating with the procs
markets

415
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:03,390
the way the software is designed is that
it's very sort of top-down

416
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,940
so when you're looking at a particular
type type

417
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,470
all the code for dealing with that tag
has been written

418
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,770
purely with that tag in mind so

419
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,510
you know the code for reading a hit
tackle the code reading in dollar tank

420
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,750
is entirely self-contained for reading
it had taken it does everything

421
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,910
that might take some data from the
coordinate processes it and it gives you

422
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:32,179
the output for head or in dollar water

423
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:37,650
our approach is being to actually starts
at that that the low level so deal with

424
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,160
the

425
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,679
the modulation scheme first and then
land attack types on top lower

426
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,600
and what that gives you as a lot of
flexibility so you can basically say

427
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,760
okay

428
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,240
there are only you know four different
modulation schemes that spurious kato's

429
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,010
PSK there's FSK

430
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,010
a.m. and then there's Manchester in
total able to put that

431
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:06,010
so if week implement those properly then
we can pretty much do anything

432
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:12,840
so now if you want to emulate a bit
stream you can just say well

433
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,169
I want to do a SK and my pulse width is
this

434
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:20,210
all my data rate is this and his the
bitstream

435
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,559
and off you go to so it's very trivial
to implement

436
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,990
those kind of the Globes

437
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,330
because the low levels done for you
similarly Manchester you can just flip

438
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,289
it to say well it's Manchester

439
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:36,770
and the ones and zeros get converted
appropriately

440
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,179
to highlight is a low voice

441
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:44,169
again FSK you tell it what the two data
rates are

442
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:47,580
tell it to spit out some binary and it
does but

443
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,320
for you

444
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,299
several EPS K

445
00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:00,429
so this was our first attempt as you can
see it's about just forget it because

446
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:01,549
it's basically

447
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:05,610
software guys trying to do hardware

448
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,660
so a we use this think this board is

449
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,190
'em told a bit whacker it's a bit like a
32

450
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,080
so very powerful tool if you want to
play with hardware you not really a

451
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,720
heart waco it

452
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,820
the this is a very powerful

453
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,620
pic32 process and it has the whole
buncha buses already built into it so

454
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,590
you can do stuff like smart cards

455
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,280
you can do can bus them

456
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,900
pretty much anything ice in i2c whatever
so we use it as a standard platform for

457
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,700
development we've got a whole library we
have our own little

458
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,090
talk likud gift the which is general
purpose hardware hacking tool

459
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,640
the and we basically develop routines in
here

460
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,400
patrolling stuff so the a first attempt
at one of these are the talks to this

461
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,650
Atlanta lock circuit here this is
connected

462
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,700
viral with spaghetti the to a

463
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,760
read to cook at sorry that's an emulator
coil

464
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,679
and agreed to call this is the logic
analyzer so I could see what the hell

465
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,000
was

466
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,510
actually going on

467
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,350
this is version 2 the we've now

468
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,730
but that circuit into a circuit has set
up a bunch spaghetti

469
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,340
still got the same bit wacky 32

470
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,210
as the main process that and now you've
got

471
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:33,179
a couple of headers so you can switch
between reader at that was later

472
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:37,240
and then chipmunk he stepped in though
some kind of weed

473
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,150
P do magic and generates something like
that

474
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:48,090
so this is the the final circuit

475
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:54,530
so yeah I said we've been playing a lot
to this is version 20

476
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,909
and actually the one I've got here is
version 22

477
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:01,880
because on my way to Vancouver the

478
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,510
the guy I met me at the airport I
literally had a cab driver

479
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,100
arrive at the airport at the same time
as me and he handed me

480
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,760
version 21 the and the day before I flew
out here

481
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,179
the I had to go to Zachs house to pick
up version 22

482
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,429
so I'm hoping I'm hoping this is the
last one

483
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,140
but every time I get back he's added
some more features

484
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:33,140
we've now got smart card and SD card and
all sorts of stuff on it

485
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,030
so a this is where I'm hoping the codes
with me

486
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:45,030
no but she can deter whatever so I'm
gonna show you how this thing works

487
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:57,030
you

488
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,550
so basically when you plug it in

489
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,710
just goes into the USB a

490
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,810
it presents itself as

491
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:10,640
a.m. ac/dc serial port so here we have

492
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,050
product id: fiddler LF and this come up
as a TTY

493
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:21,140
so I can just use any a.m. see related
stalk to it

494
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,930
before use many call that she if you
don't

495
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:30,370
if you don't want to use USB it will
detect

496
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,990
at detail connection as well so you can
connect with center to a port

497
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:41,990
as well

498
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,070
okay the you

499
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:04,960
so as you can see

500
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,070
it's got quite an extensive menu you can
do a whole buncha stuff

501
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,240
so what we've tried to do is create a.m.

502
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,140
pretty much all the components you would
want to do if you want to test a system

503
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,010
or

504
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,400
and ELISA Tagore copy a tag or whatever

505
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,120
we got built-in commands to to the

506
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,920
it's very easy to extend as a said
because we built this framework

507
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,060
the you can you configure it

508
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:35,820
to say what type attack you wanna play
with it sets a buncha promoters

509
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,980
and those are very easy to to generate
new want when you come across a new take

510
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,650
type

511
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,740
you just figure out what the premises of
set them up and you've added new

512
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,830
tectonic so if I say tax

513
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,280
it'll tell me the current tight types
that it knows about

514
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,430
we currently set to unique

515
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:59,570
which is a standard an effort to call
fake

516
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,390
these are the prime it is that you have
to set

517
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,490
so you tellin if it's a skor FSK what
happened

518
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:12,159
his Manchester by phase if the date is
in person at the day to rate

519
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,370
and so on so

520
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:19,200
it has a concert took

521
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,879
to the tax you've got the real physical
tag

522
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,260
so whatever this prompt areas that's
what you're currently set to

523
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,750
to county was set to uni so if I find a
uni

524
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,050
tunic stick it on the coil

525
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:40,399
your to you I T Corsicana Peter

526
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,220
the chime

527
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,360
I'm thinking it's this metal table is
probably not helping

528
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:54,360
bomb yeah

529
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:02,330
this is gonna be fun a the so wanna come
and help me by holding the stacks of the

530
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,450
metal tape but

531
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:10,450
year no it's not gonna work or okay so

532
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:19,340
yeah metal and are thirty just really
don't go together

533
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,770
so as you can see we've successfully
read

534
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:29,770
you I D can you read this at the back no
a better

535
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,380
yeah okay so we've read the you I D

536
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,540
so in this case it's this number

537
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,690
well I can also do is say a copy that

538
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,920
so if I just a copy I'm

539
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,290
that says okay I've copied you'll notice
that we also got a little asterisks

540
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:55,550
here that's to say that something's
changed so the conflict has changed but

541
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,760
we haven't stored it

542
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,830
what's actually happened is we've never
created a virtual tak

543
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,910
so be tagged now has the

544
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,150
a copy of that tag in its memory so

545
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,160
this is the you I D as unique

546
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,930
would define it and this is the role
bitstream

547
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:19,610
that actually goes over the air so we
remember that

548
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,970
a.m. and it's been copied to

549
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:27,840
a acute 5 by 2-fold so it q5 is

550
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,060
the the tyke thats configurable

551
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:36,090
to be any kind of take you wanted to be
so what I can do now

552
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,200
lemme now it's in memory

553
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,970
I could also emulate it

554
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:49,450
so this is a standard reader

555
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:54,290
if Thomas host the tank up to this
reader it'll go pee

556
00:36:54,290 --> 00:37:01,290
and its given me an ID

557
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,030
but now do the same thing and just hold
the reader up to the coil

558
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:18,030
was nothing happens because of the
Taylor

559
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:32,430
hostage

560
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,130
this was every time beria

561
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,470
so it's now read from the the emulator

562
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:43,820
the other thing you can do is tell at

563
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,350
actually right to a queue phone so this
is a blank q5

564
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,780
if Thomas hold back to Titanic

565
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:57,890
I can just say copy no

566
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:04,890
sweetie is

567
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,410
unbelievable told

568
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:17,410
for naked

569
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,660
let sorry I'm being an idiot

570
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,300
copy is reading phone is writing

571
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,490
to

572
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,080
don't even know my own kip on so what

573
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,510
yes a copy copies from the physical type
to the virtual tyke

574
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,550
clone rights from the virtual tyke to
the physical tank

575
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,960
so a as you so what I actually did now

576
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,380
was eyeing code is an arbitrary value
from unique to q5

577
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,420
and if we look at the V tach a.m.

578
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,450
we running unique

579
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,630
and if I repeat that

580
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,160
so again

581
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,330
but the street from the q5 which is now
emulating

582
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:32,770
that tight tight the other thing you can
do if you're examining

583
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,310
an unknown tag is on the back end up all
these readers

584
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,510
there's a at industry standard called
why can't

585
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,860
so why can't is the wiring that's used
for reader

586
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,440
to talk to the back-end system so this
is a standard hit reader

587
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,710
it is like the one of the biggest

588
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:56,440
manufacturers in the world that this
kind of stuff so if we plug

589
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,310
and native hit reader into of fiddler

590
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:05,170
we can actually do it why can't read

591
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,140
we finish a takes Italian

592
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,210
thank you thanks thank you Thomas

593
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,930
so

594
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,750
I'm if I go why can't read

595
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,450
so is waiting for the external reader to
talk

596
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:30,940
and if I present a native tag it's now
read

597
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:36,510
the taters measured the pulse width so
in microseconds

598
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:40,790
the spur t9 microseconds with the gap
about

599
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,560
2000 and a bit period overall with just
over two thousand

600
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,210
so if we wanted to we can now play data
back

601
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,630
on the why can't pass using the correct
timings

602
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:57,310
because we now know the timings for this
reader the

603
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:03,520
if I take this the bitstream the first

604
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,460
eight bits is

605
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:17,460
what's called the cite code

606
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,710
3 a psycho div six and

607
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:40,710
I'll

608
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,100
are you I D 30 double one phone if

609
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,300
which is actually what's printed on the
back to this card so we know now that

610
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,380
the data being sent

611
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,550
over the back end matches what's on the
card

612
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,270
and with any luck a funny the say

613
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:09,270
in

614
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:23,940
me

615
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,930
so there we have successfully read using
the

616
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:35,470
the coil we're at the same data so we
got psycho to publish 6

617
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:40,280
and you I P a 30 2015

618
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,650
so that should much that rotator

619
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,300
so we know we definitely reading the
right data

620
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,820
so if you analyzing an unknown tag
that's an enormous step

621
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,720
you know the ahead before you had no way
of knowing what the psycho twirls

622
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,950
what the you.it was the now you can
actually do it in a few simple steps you

623
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,140
can figure out what

624
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:10,140
what the hell's going on it also
extensible

625
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,900
so home me

626
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,910
if you don't want to use the menu system

627
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:28,050
you could just use the Python wrapper so
we've written the Python right before

628
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:35,050
in

629
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,789
has crashed

630
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:49,899
this last time I ever do you like 10 min

631
00:43:49,899 --> 00:43:54,859
yeah

632
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:59,679
so normal ping will just reply of Hitler
and then you can do stuff like

633
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,049
lemme set

634
00:44:03,049 --> 00:44:07,549
Nick it 28-6

635
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:14,549
emulate I'll

636
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,820
if I put the coil on the native reader

637
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:26,820
so we just emulate attack

638
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,310
I think on that happy note

639
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:37,310
I'm going to call it quits you up when
you can you buy one now

640
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,849
you can put your name down for 10 p.m.
in

641
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:51,060
and hopefully about two weeks two to
three weeks one thing I was gonna

642
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,270
quickly say was

643
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:58,119
at the conference I was at in in
Vancouver one of the guys was staying

644
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,660
'em at nearby hotel where they were
using an access control system but never

645
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,609
seen before

646
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:08,010
and because if they're the a.m.

647
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:12,130
the modularity of the system it was
really easy to take

648
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:15,609
an existing we had a look at the the
reader

649
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:19,230
we found the name of the the device was
called a top you I T

650
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,740
we found someone had already done an
analysis that the low-level

651
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,950
stuff the which was here

652
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:30,220
so we downloaded his day to see and he
talked about

653
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,830
you know what frequency is its FSK this
is the day to rate

654
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:36,980
this is the pits and soul the

655
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,300
and literally within an hour we have
added

656
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,839
that former to fiddler so now you can
just

657
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,760
set the type type 2 a whit 26 in code

658
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,790
any number you want to a key for life it
generates the appropriate data

659
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:57,080
clone right to the tag and that take
just worked first time

660
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,500
so 'em that framework really works it's
really easy

661
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:06,720
22 just at new stuff to so literally one
hour from seeing the first I kept going

662
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,190
and walking into the building

663
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:13,550
um my question mailings that let's say
you wanted to test an RFID system

664
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,650
arm and you have like a thousand

665
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,910
keys that you want to southern RFID keys
the on a test

666
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,109
howdy automate that process how is this
any

667
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:26,300
as the our framework allow you to do
something about the mission of the unit

668
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:26,820
like to

669
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,980
move the call back and forth ortega
something

670
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,680
okay um well get as it happens the

671
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,560
I'm the current

672
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,910
a thing that's holding up production is
I'm working on a test

673
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,910
rake the and so built into the

674
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:47,970
the the framework

675
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:53,720
is a test come along so if I run of
fiddler with no new

676
00:46:53,720 --> 00:47:00,420
E

677
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,630
it'll just keep me help so

678
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:07,930
a.m.

679
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:12,650
strip so if we look at the menu option

680
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,290
there's a you've got a bunch of D but
pins

681
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,520
so the debug dans the

682
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,630
you can flip to which the model

683
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:27,570
so you could buy something up I mean it
but I know how you can feed 2002

684
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:31,780
tax but if you've got some kinda the
activated

685
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:35,040
a feeder then you could have

686
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:42,040
fiddler bringing the tags if the cards
changing all the time

687
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:49,630
a.m. yeah well with the rapper with the
Python wrapper you can do whatever you

688
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,080
want

689
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,260
so you could just say you at the the

690
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,670
so well 42

691
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,680
to blow whatever

692
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,349
just buy a loop the so you can write
whatever code you want to wrap the

693
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,220
commands and do whatever you want to the
a in API boat it just gets you back the

694
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,210
rotator

695
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:14,030
what it got back from the command you
sent that is that what you mean

696
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:18,390
I see you want to brute force tonight
the

697
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:22,920
onto reader yes show also well they
emulate command that I sent

698
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,310
a.m. I sent an email etc about here

699
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:30,530
which was emulating cite code 1234 5678

700
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,200
I could easily put that in the loop the

701
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,950
which you know bended knowing benten
been eleven

702
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:42,490
whatever 'em a new could hook up a scent
so maybe to the light

703
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:45,540
so when it gets a green light the than
it knows

704
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,260
that that the door opened so it will
automatically stop when the door opened

705
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,230
it you mentioned doing the model issued
demolition software

706
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,680
so I was curious on the performance I'll

707
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,660
was it more or less performant then how
using a dedicated hardware

708
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,740
model it to people it I'm

709
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:08,210
okay so basically that what we ended up
doing is

710
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:12,920
the the that a SK modulation circuit

711
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,900
just gives you a data point whenever

712
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:23,250
no there's there is some modulation so
if its peers k you get a spike if it's

713
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:28,920
Pask you get either high or low when the
carriers there or not there

714
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,850
if you were trying to actually D
modulate the 125 killer hurts

715
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:39,250
at that level you would be having to
process 125 thousand events per second

716
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:44,450
the and that's why things like the prop
smart use an FPGA

717
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:47,520
because we're not trying to do that
because we've done the very low level

718
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,369
modulation

719
00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:52,580
in an analog circuit we're only dealing
with a few thousand

720
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:56,089
a events per second so pic is

721
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:59,690
easily powerful enough to to and in fact
a.m.

722
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:02,910
the way the projects designed as you can
discard

723
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:07,250
the pics I dove the the circuit and just
take the analog side

724
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:12,080
and if you want to drive it from a knot
we know BeagleBone or whatever you want

725
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,830
then you can you just write your own for
work for
