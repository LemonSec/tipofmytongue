1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,260
alright so we gonna be talking about
a.m. possum mobile point-of-sale

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,470
terminals today

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,889
on we're gonna keep the introduction and
they got light fluffy stuff to a minimum

4
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:10,639
but we're gonna basically get straight
into

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,650
um take a look at them from a security
perspective the bombs were found

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,820
and we're gonna be deming some some
exploits and the

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,550
some fairly sweet stuff so let Mills

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,410
to introduce himself now I am

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,570
I'm Neal climber security researcher at
NW all previous research focused on

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,570
a mobil's I'm specifically Android
unmanned

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,899
no two years ago we did a little
research into a.m.

12
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:43,120
payment terminal so the traditional
payment terminals that use for

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,390
achievement in payments and overextended
also recently that research on to

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,670
am a chance as well yes I'm John I'm

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,940
I head up the the UK independent
research from WR

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,670
I love my background has been in
involved they have in reverse

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,429
engineering

18
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:03,519
Amanda works also with bells on on the
payments terminal security in and the

19
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:04,350
ATM stuff

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,490
I also quite involved in in browser
security I'm specifically to crime

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,360
so

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,560
you for bill use point-of-sale devices I
mean

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,210
there absolutely everywhere I'm anytime
you make any chipped in 10 payment

24
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:19,860
you've used

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,140
appoint a cell device and we've done
some some research in some presentations

26
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,170
into that before

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,290
I am obviously the trend is for
everything to go mobile

28
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,420
right because you know why not I am so

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,390
the the hipsters have decided that
payment should be mobile to and so they

30
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,440
came up with the

31
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,050
with mobile point-of-sale on it has a
few advantages especially for small

32
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,620
businesses mostly around

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,220
cost-effectiveness so you don't have to
have some crazy back and set up

34
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,340
and you don't have to necessarily have a
a

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,050
payment provider with the contracts you
can have like a rolling

36
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,960
single transaction see for example I'm
sometimes is used by larger companies

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,690
who are trying to be really cool

38
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,710
a one example being Apple and so they've
been using their own

39
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,810
I devices and a little kind of card slot
on the back for a while now

40
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,880
um this is probably the most prominent
use it impossible haven't really taken

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,690
off too much just yet in in commercial
markets but that's certainly

42
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,180
becoming more popular so am

43
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,260
let's take a a contrived example so you
have

44
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,160
a a small business owner a whose

45
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,180
his who's selling some very bespoke
software

46
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,410
a so it's its high as high-value

47
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,230
and you know to be honest with you is
getting quite tired of carrying

48
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,860
backs a cash arounds its

49
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,930
its you know it's it's not the best way
to take to take payments you know

50
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,940
he can afford some the computer for some
cool shoes to give it to him

51
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,230
so this could be one example where he
could rock up with an an imposter vice

52
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,120
instead intake

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,110
and take our payments Minnesota carrying
around his is back so cash

54
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,140
as every take for example I settle who
are

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,510
one of these little devices for example
you could carry around

56
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,630
take payment by card and have no
recurring fees and a requirement for

57
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,880
a steady monthly transaction and his now
ever

58
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,620
ever so valuable Windows XP zero-day him
I end up paying

59
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,860
something like a 750 US for

60
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,780
a 50k which is quite cheaper something
which is you know not gonna get patch

61
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,260
now

62
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,280
am but still you know this is not a huge
amount of money

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,440
Fort the obvious benefits if you're not
getting mugged on the way back to

64
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,030
Thailand

65
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,510
a.m. so

66
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,180
the first such devices the that came out
were were in the US

67
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,500
as such as this this is the for
suffering from square

68
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,080
and its super simple you know it's a
little audio sync up to the top

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,860
Panamax wipe is what the card it mike
says the data

70
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,700
in some crazy science the way sends over
the audio in the applicant and read it

71
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,450
from the audio

72
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,520
and and verify that data these are
basically mobile skimming devices

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,310
a.m. there's no chip and pin certainly
in in the US

74
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,040
a so you basically just swiping your
credit card into some guy's phone

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,430
and land of the free and home of the
brave has never been quite so applicable

76
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,980
is that people who are willing to do
that um

77
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,120
this model has obvious flaws right
there's there's this so much wrong with

78
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,750
this is untrue and we're not even gonna

79
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,519
look into anymore other than this was
not a bad first attempt but we we

80
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,540
obviously need better

81
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,080
for the developed world so a concert
companies like Africa and South America

82
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,430
where you know

83
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,010
we we've we've evolved beyond just
swiping a card into stuff and hoping

84
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,120
everything's fine

85
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,910
so we have a fairly widespread chip and
pin adoption

86
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,790
I am and chip and pin if you think about
the way the chip and pin works

87
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,639
it works much better to have a
standalone terminal for civil you need

88
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,480
much more than just

89
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,680
a max white Yukon just you know so I bet
you need to enter

90
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,040
a pin number um you think about the use
case

91
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,380
if you did a similar thing that's gonna
plugs into the top you have to hand the

92
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,770
mobile device over them

93
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,990
for the card in but numbers in hand it
back so

94
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,680
a.m. the use case for something a
stand-alone to the device that you can

95
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,630
hand to the person making the payment

96
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,680
makes a lot more sense so that's what we
ended up with

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,550
so we've got quite a few of these
devices here as it is popular brands

98
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,030
such as one from that bank which is
South African bank

99
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,790
pay levin which is my lovely assistant
here

100
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,139
Pay Pal so Scott a big-name that this
was actually quite interesting to pay

101
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,560
pay Palacio an online payment provider

102
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,060
and this is as far as we can tell their
first attempts to make the move into

103
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,160
into the physical space I previously if
you making a Pay Pal payment is gonna be

104
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,710
basically

105
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,320
e-bay something online whereas now pay
pal can push into

106
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,310
small small businesses may be market
stalls that kind of thing

107
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,400
the one from well pay as well

108
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,590
and insurance

109
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,770
and finally the market leader which at
the moment is is I settle

110
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,520
now what you'll notice from these
devices is love the quite similar

111
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,759
and there's a good reason for that so
even though they have different plastic

112
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,030
they are essentially

113
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,960
underneath the same device which is the
mural shuttle um

114
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,130
a small embedded Linux two on base
device

115
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,060
and their generic hardware so so once we
saw this but so this stuff down a bit

116
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,150
we found out that the hardware that's in
here is essentially the same stuff you

117
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,639
might find in in some

118
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,720
cheap mp3 players for example so this is
not a specialist but have kept

119
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,060
it's essentially no Linux with the with
the card slot

120
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,169
I'm in a few things tacked onto the site
so we're looking at these devices from a

121
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:30,570
security perspective we really
interested in

122
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,360
a what interfaces are the how to
interact with this

123
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,290
and and then we can start looking at the
attack surface so as a few obvious

124
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,050
interfaces as

125
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,300
this the card slot Sophie Mb
transactions

126
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,320
chip and pin as the Mac swipe at the top

127
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,240
which hopefully we shouldn't be using
much richer then but it's there anyway

128
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,270
is Bluetooth so these things work by
pairing them with

129
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,090
with a mobile device over pleated that's
how you can hand the thing over and it

130
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,840
all happens while it's Liam

131
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,720
had a and then this micro USB as well
which is

132
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,440
the most useful for charging the device

133
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,850
um or at least that's thus theory

134
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,270
the so the first thing we did obviously
when we got the is is is USB we have

135
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,680
lots of USB cables run between

136
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,970
let them in and straight away it
basically gave up the goods and said

137
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,840
yeah I'm a mass storage device as well
if you do not need that

138
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,800
um so cool with alright this is this
could be a walk in the park

139
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,720
which is gonna you know a copy love the
pins of therein will be done

140
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,210
obviously maybe not quite that simple so

141
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,550
we have to take a bit to a close look at

142
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,009
luckily I think only a couple love them
did this wrong

143
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,020
but if we just DD that flash image in
run been walk over there was some fairly

144
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,009
obvious

145
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,039
hints that perhaps they might have just
removed it not

146
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,190
Sarada so we're able to recover

147
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,289
by city the tar.gz which is used to
initialize the device

148
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:01,970
this contains all of the device software
configuration

149
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,610
not necessarily anything critical apps
there's no data pre-populated have it is

150
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,870
all that the payment application that
runs on the device

151
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,139
the configuration for for the MV so what
it supports

152
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,419
and all the scripts that are used to
power the device take it down and you

153
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:14,870
know

154
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,699
handle various events

155
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,419
so we're able by silly to start looking
at the device so reverse engineer the

156
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,620
binaries and take apart the the scripts

157
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,410
that has put together so we discovered
fairly quickly that the images

158
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,620
that you can put onto these devices are

159
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,529
assigned so-so them the mass storage a
is there

160
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,789
we can only assume to allow you to do

161
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,870
software upgrades as a as an end-user
which is actually a really good feature

162
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,529
if you think about help how you my patch
traditional POS terminals has been a

163
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,110
a real problem in getting fixes for on
abilities discovered on these devices

164
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,580
advance you can posses it's got mass
storage in you just drop drop

165
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,750
signed image from the vendor on the
should reboot

166
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,310
and then reinstall and your patch so it
they thought about it

167
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,440
certainly and they've signed the
software images

168
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,000
so we didn't find an easy win just got
our own code running by by chucking are

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,160
unmodified

170
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,170
version suffer on their however

171
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,149
a.m. is for be only one other thing that
could screw up which is the code that

172
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:19,690
runs to look for

173
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,399
a software images to install um

174
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,959
and yes well they well they say are you
assigned image no they also support

175
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,950
searching through things like

176
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,560
top files and we managed to find a
Ackman injection vulnerability in there

177
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,029
which allowed us to get code execution
on the device so we're gonna demo that

178
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:45,029
real quick

179
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,149
okay so I am by sydell I'll let you all
know how

180
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:52,750
how this works the plug in the device
elves amounts as mass storage um

181
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,630
we're gonna run scripts which copies a
this across

182
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,339
this is essentially the code that with
the we're gonna run um when you unplug

183
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:02,170
the device

184
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,560
it runs the routine is a captures the
event and runs the routine to search

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,540
for firmware applies at that so and
that's basically when

186
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,540
the expo will run will plug it back in
what we're doing is a jewish shopping

187
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,550
something onto the

188
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,699
onto the external mass torture books

189
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:21,920
Iran's by

190
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,139
so we unplug the device now yes it so
this triggers the

191
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,600
the the oven ability so im plug it back
in

192
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,600
the stuff we dropped should be there
yeah

193
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,160
yet jolly good I'll txt very British
file names here

194
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,790
a so you can see it we've confirmed that
its it is indeed

195
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,960
limits by system and the upper if I D
says we're running as main user

196
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,580
I D 500 which is okay a.m.

197
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,890
but route would be nice a so lightly

198
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,550
we have access to love the scripts that
run internally and it was fairly quick

199
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,450
to find

200
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,020
a another command injection in something
was running as root

201
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,290
so essentially be copied another follow
cross now which is gonna explode up on

202
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:15,870
ability

203
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,960
and run the same commands output to it
to

204
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,770
said se si

205
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,020
you id0 in a different order just to
prove it's a different script and

206
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,510
everything

207
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,580
um yes oh that was actually a fairly
quick and easy way

208
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,410
obviously this requires physical access
to the vice I don't think anyone

209
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,160
making a payment you know with the
vendor would would defend it just

210
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,930
wouldn't look the other way if you were
saying there unplugging and plugging in

211
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,400
with the laptop and you know so it's

212
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,650
not the most practical for walking up to
market stall exploiting it but if you

213
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,960
have access to one of these

214
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,400
you tonight paid the person who can

215
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,620
you clean the shop after hours and had
access to these terminals a fairly easy

216
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,150
to

217
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:00,540
to get access to personal big you could
quite easily exploit one of these and

218
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,560
just leave the back to the terminal
waiting for

219
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,660
shop owner in the morning for example
ice on a possible to knows not to to

220
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,900
continue the presentation okay sir at
this point that code execution on the

221
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,830
device and we can now start to

222
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,940
assess but the bison and the more
dynamic way

223
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,080
um we're able to copy over to be so have
a copy for example to

224
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,190
look at the execution of the of the main
payment terminal

225
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,400
kitchen and this John's at the USB
attack but to my computer

226
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,630
my up most useful for national attacker
to look at

227
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,110
and so we have a look at other I'm a
tech a

228
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,350
the remaining attack surface as well I'm
as we mentioned before that use

229
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,480
Bluetooth in order to do the
communication was mobile device

230
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,480
and um as we have learned over the years
the

231
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,510
the mobile device is probably not the
most trusted device in the world

232
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,620
especially if you use

233
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,650
I'm some Android device in order to take
your payments

234
00:12:54,650 --> 00:13:00,040
I'm in in those cases we can probably
assume that it is compromised in some

235
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,530
way

236
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,400
or but it is feasible at least one
attacker to compromise a mobile device

237
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,660
and was a compromise mobile device they
will be able to communicate

238
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,310
Rhys a.m. the payment terminals which ru
which they are pat Quinn says bolt so

239
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,130
around the bushes attack surfaces is
really interesting for an attack because

240
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,880
that could

241
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,220
leverage existing access to I am

242
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,459
to advice that is pat was was apparent
terminal

243
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:27,430
in order to get code execution on the
parent a payment terminal

244
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,540
now one of the few just re resort was
quite interesting morse

245
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,400
a FileUpload future events through
bluetooth

246
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,700
protocol the use a custom a blue two's

247
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,870
for the covert free reverse engineer it
in order to to communicate ourselves as

248
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,500
a parent

249
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,870
tunnels and this file upload is usually
used to use the

250
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,750
change the configuration of the payment
on wall want to upload

251
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,880
updates directly onto the payment
terminal on

252
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,990
in order to to update to rid the payment
application that was running on the

253
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,750
surpluses

254
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,230
and

255
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,830
its probably to no one's surprise in
this feature we found another boner

256
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,270
ability which losses to get code
execution

257
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,110
on the payment terminal I'm and we're
going to demonstrate that knows well

258
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,890
um so a.m.

259
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,250
and customer reviews the net bank device
as we said all of this device a pretty

260
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:22,610
much

261
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,570
based on on the same hardware and
software was only minor

262
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,160
customizations on on different devices
the next on such murdering on that on

263
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,250
the table device

264
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,820
probably one of the biggest names a.m.
in this

265
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,680
market um so currently

266
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,240
um our leftovers pick up with the device

267
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,040
or just attending that the laptop is on
the mobile device

268
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,500
and others usually driving dependent on
oil I'm

269
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,510
and it can connect to to the device from

270
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,100
nurtures a.m. well that is

271
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,110
blue Bluetooth happens work on Linux
once on

272
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,170
so that was successful we exploit the
vulnerability um

273
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,600
by uploading a custom script from again

274
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,600
month injection vulnerabilities that
it's really liked nineties on these

275
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,220
devices

276
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,079
and everything that you find this really
straightforward to exploit

277
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,230
um what or exploit note that

278
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,240
opened another serial Bluetooth sport

279
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:30,240
which should now be able to connect

280
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,329
hopefully I'm so it's explode work will
be able to connect to two new serial

281
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,240
port that is open on the device

282
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,300
um and because it is little awkward from

283
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,160
execute code on the device by re running
scripts over

284
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,130
overuse B Reno of an interactive shell
I'm on the bus

285
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,740
we can do everything that we could could
be doing on the a.m.

286
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,750
on the normal limits system where you
have to completion working

287
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,780
which is really and is a you can see the
ARM processor that is used in the 200

288
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,990
megahertz which is actually not too bad
I'm

289
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,250
and through the bluetooths um a
vulnerability we've got code execution

290
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,070
and can be exploited the same

291
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,110
privilege escalation to go with a step
up from maine use up

292
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,290
um up to you um to root on that the
Bison's

293
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,150
because is this a payment on linen take
a quick note lookups

294
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,320
for example devices that are available a

295
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,570
one example would be that the mix like
to buy some new reno

296
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,520
a.m. swipe a prepaid credit card through
that

297
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:41,520
was that the right word

298
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:51,160
well it should usually work for some
reason that doesn't work

299
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,250
although I am maybe the Mets what the
buzz is not in the right state currently

300
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,600
but anyway it am before we're able to
read

301
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,709
read the Mets what that has strayed from
from

302
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:06,880
from the device and we have full access
to all of other parts of the devices

303
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,390
holds responsibility

304
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,300
so this attack is already much more
useful for an attack on however that has

305
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,359
to have

306
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,740
X-ers to you to the mobile devices
payout

307
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,980
all needs to be able to some hope as I'm
device

308
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,320
a.m. 0 with with a terminal which

309
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,690
I'm which might be a problem to avoid

310
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,130
that as much more interesting attack
surface as well in that this the

311
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,929
chip and pin a smart card interface
itself if we would be able to find one

312
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:38,340
ability and

313
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,290
I'm code that this pardon the the chip
and pin transaction

314
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,340
hungry now would be able to exploit
vulnerabilities on the device

315
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,500
am just as a normal customer makes a
payment on the

316
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,770
ice which opens up the the attack
surface for quite

317
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,720
quite a bit I am so %um be assessed
under been used

318
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,200
um pretty much everywhere for for any
car payments

319
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,030
um so smart card-based aka payments

320
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,679
stands for you recall most up in the
zone

321
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,330
on which whether organizations working
on the standard a.m.

322
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,650
so basically we are testing this apology
for testing in the payments is basically

323
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,010
a really basic laws of which we unplug
your Wii

324
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,640
on just use any programmable smart card

325
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,860
a.m. initiate the impeachment sections
and then

326
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,960
return just change values for

327
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,220
from whiny any of the steps in the the
transaction look for us on the device

328
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,429
we know if debugging capabilities so if
we find a narrow that

329
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,810
makes it really easy to exploit the
Tyros well or 22 investigated for those

330
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,990
I'm what usually a good area to look for
bucks

331
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,360
in those and yet the implementations as
a parting of the different data text

332
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,650
that are transmitted as part of and the
youngest I'm not

333
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,990
and all of this data text are stored in
the till the format

334
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,360
um we have seen other mistakes in the
TLD pausing before

335
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,480
on as someone is a good example whether
the store data

336
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,490
and in a similar way so now you're able
to use mom supplied the data itself

337
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,230
but also supply the links and was a lot
of the implementation of these

338
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,310
a chip and pin I am kernels is what they
call the library so do the pausing

339
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:25,080
am you often find arrows where they
expect for example an expiry date to be

340
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,800
three bytes long and a few supply them
with an expiry dates 200 bytes long

341
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,530
they might run into problems problem
some

342
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,740
this Mb unless as most other you which
ones we have looked at so far

343
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,760
I usually implemented in C++ or C plus
plus

344
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,649
I'm sOooo somebody else's spectacles
memory corruption if they are not

345
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:48,860
implemented correctly

346
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,550
um didn't take us long to more once he
started testing that you'd be part of a

347
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,280
supplication

348
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,710
find a I'm stock-based of overflowing
million be pausing

349
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,659
there's no protection mechanisms on the
device which could spoil the fun of

350
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,710
exploitation

351
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,149
so that no annex know as Latin must but
you would expect a modern device

352
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:12,710
I'm and the actually the back that we
found itself on this device

353
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,940
is very similar to a buck agree
previously explored on a different

354
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,740
device

355
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,940
a.m. in 2012 sir all of those and those
made

356
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,290
similar mistakes and implement the gym
teacher today a.m. summers in the trust

357
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,409
Libyan put on on the smart card to be

358
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,600
a.m. in in this up for more than two be

359
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,390
to be part of that the trust which I'm

360
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,550
is not a great assumption to make I'm

361
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,270
no we had that have thought about how do
we implement a demonstration

362
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,550
and some there's no collar

363
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,960
on the device that but we could execute
so that that's not an option

364
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,450
your I'm and nowadays exploits are yet
to be entertaining

365
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,510
and in order to you made for a good
demonstration

366
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,210
I'm so we decided to implement a
flexible plan on the bus

367
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,090
um just because second to set this up

368
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:10,560
a.m. River

369
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,440
if the camera as well so that you can
see the actual demonstration

370
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,270
needs a second for the setup

371
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,919
to this demonstration we going to do on
the device of the market leader which is

372
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:25,890
I settle

373
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,390
I'm again very some law and software to
route all of the other devices

374
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,909
reno no big surprises I'm nazis device
bruting upsets

375
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:37,909
it's booting up in a fresh stage I'm

376
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:41,929
we didn't to any persistent changes to
the device once booted up ads in the

377
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:42,669
state

378
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:46,399
you will find it at when you buy a
coffee shop

379
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:50,640
um but takes brief second

380
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,280
done we're not using died at level
occasion you too to make the transaction

381
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,360
with implemented all on prices grip I
meant

382
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,980
to you to do the payment process which
is particularly handy if you do

383
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,140
a.m. semi-automatic automated testing of
the

384
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,510
of the Year be a.m. you be part of the
application

385
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,620
so that you don't have to to start an
actual transaction and

386
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,740
I'm neither application um

387
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,760
so once as to what you see now is

388
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,120
devices booted up at the screen is
really not great for

389
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,980
for filming the screen so it says
welcome in the middle notes from

390
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,470
probably won't be able to read on the
screen I'm

391
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,890
let me know start the the places group
but runs

392
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,929
reached president start the transactions
through the Bluetooth protocol

393
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:43,510
um we considered snow Austin

394
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:50,399
for the cops be inserted um jon is going
to insert the cart

395
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:53,640
and what we see now is asks you to enter
pin

396
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,130
to the first part of the transaction
already happened

397
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,860
I'm second part to start now by entering
the plan

398
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,750
and now it says the pin is a que and for
some reason it got stuck there

399
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,750
and the reason that got stuck to us that
I'm has executed

400
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,399
has executed the first stage of or
payload

401
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:18,419
at this point it is listening on I done
on a blue to serial port

402
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,340
we are able to inject firm

403
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,240
we are able to inject I am link keys

404
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,179
I'm we whispered executioners route that
we have on the device through the

405
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,370
vulnerabilities through

406
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,580
a a device doesn't need to be paid out
to the two now initialize the second

407
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,590
stage

408
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,890
I am on the device which is all actual
payload

409
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,530
that is executed to return our open
another Bluetooth connection which

410
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,890
which was open for by the exploit and
became popular for those

411
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:52,890
the second stage which will then be
executed on the device

412
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,840
we see all we pretend she would be able
to see

413
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,850
should be. trippin by hand over your
lips

414
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,649
and asked us to press any key in order
to stop the game and I'm

415
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:18,019
really not very good at the spur up

416
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:21,610
day all Dame opus 40 almost like that

417
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,980
the actual Flipboard so if you

418
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,919
if you want to have a play later on just
as in the bob we'll bring the card and a

419
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:29,539
terminal

420
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:33,730
up are a really looked at as a

421
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,909
so we wrote the game but Republic sleep
late a.m.

422
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:43,100
so um its it's a fun way to offer of
demonstrating never get code execution

423
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,429
on the device but it also

424
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:48,159
demonstrates a few other interesting
factors for factual exploitation on the

425
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:48,669
prices

426
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:52,090
first of all we have control of the
screen which is really important because

427
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:57,049
I am the customer and the merchant will
trust the screen of a payment

428
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,760
time and we also able to read I'm
improved

429
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,029
from um from the keypad bridge

430
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:07,649
would potentially lowers to implement an
application that

431
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:11,760
Rizza pinned 80 and during a trip to
transactions the

432
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,630
a.m. that's all some serious points miss
her instruction as well

433
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,679
a.m. well a only I would get to 10

434
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,850
firm few more screenshots woodrow

435
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,010
which are better for readability um see
the game up those will

436
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,289
began the school 0 a.m. to

437
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:35,519
an attack hopelessly wouldn't implement
the game

438
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,159
was in order to a.m. to that some
benefit of a vulnerability like this

439
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,649
and they will be more interested in the
hots monetize

440
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:48,840
on the phone or abilities I'm the PIN
pad during the PIN entry is in the

441
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,730
secure stage

442
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,919
but that's only one i/o control away
from being switched into

443
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,720
months it just ate so that you can read
brought it all for a.m.

444
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,669
of the planned by so that's not a not a
problem you have full control over the

445
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:01,149
screen

446
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:04,760
so there plenty options but let's look
at

447
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,899
Watson actual payload might look like
I'm

448
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:12,190
an attacker could I'm change
supplication to

449
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,529
that after the PIN entry it justice
place try again

450
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:19,899
Anandan switches a PIN pad into the in
secure mode and just looked up and they

451
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:20,260
took

452
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,080
I'm even better with who

453
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,510
you be actually protects against a lot
of the abuse exploitation space that

454
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,450
there's no way of

455
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,409
just cloning and %um carts just by
having to chip card and a

456
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:35,480
doesn't allow you to make a copy of the
chip card which you would then be able

457
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,590
to use ATM's

458
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,730
what it what be more like just that
undertaken and decides to display a

459
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,700
fallback message

460
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,590
which of the customer to swipe
departments instead of using chip and

461
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,970
pin

462
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,610
am just read the max what device and

463
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,289
then click to track to date I know we
have tried to data enter pin

464
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:57,179
a.m. for the card and we can use it to
clone a cart

465
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,470
and use it at a team's so we reckon that
would be the most

466
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,200
like the implementation of an attack but
am other options as well

467
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,529
well that have occurred just implement

468
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:11,510
for Creek when militias cartridge just
accept the payment

469
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,139
by getting code execution changing that
it has been slow to accept the payment

470
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:19,960
without any a actual money ever make it
to the bank too cumbersome much

471
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,690
so that would be really quick when on
will be a

472
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,549
little more interesting attack
especially for banks that

473
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:32,299
on would have to investigators it X is
to change the time military just

474
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:32,870
terminal

475
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,059
I'm sorry Madrid remember the research
done by the guys in Cambridge

476
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:40,169
whether it discussed a possible job for
us. cops

477
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:44,289
residue a.m. to change a card to always
say yes to any plan

478
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:47,580
and then you can use stolen carts that
way for

479
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,570
a.m. for making payments to change the
terminal to accept every plan

480
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,010
not even checking the the pin was a cop
just accept the pin

481
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,360
what's so you could use the militias up
once to make changes to a terminal and

482
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,019
after that you will be able to use any
stolen card

483
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:05,480
any stone chip and pin Cup on those
terminals and a.m.

484
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,750
usually banks say that if the

485
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,690
transaction is made with such a bad
thing called that's a customer's fault

486
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,470
because someone

487
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,169
must have from Nexus two to the pin
number so they

488
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:21,409
am of not willing to reimburse them for
that know it's a timeless compromise and

489
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:25,440
has changed her yes terminal people will
be able to make payments on the chip

490
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,629
card without having to

491
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:30,110
actual pin number what from your

492
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,629
put the proteins and in front of quite a
few problems

493
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,379
I'm one frontal

494
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:40,909
the vulnerabilities on dental floss to
arm we

495
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:45,610
obviously compared to defend about them
I am their response was very encouraging

496
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,169
I'm they were very interested in the
results

497
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:53,279
I'm read a few regions with some they
are currently addressing those problems

498
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,520
at all

499
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,070
online update abilities follow those
devices sir

500
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,110
I'm getting two pages out on those
devices shouldn't be a problem I'm

501
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:06,570
however no no pages have been released
as follows: yet we have seen so far so

502
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,340
so we're still waiting i'm for that that
salsa room the reason why we didn't have

503
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:10,830
any

504
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:16,029
full technical details on the
vulnerabilities

505
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,039
so the conclusion out of this as I'm was

506
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,049
was employs basically as as we've seen
its

507
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:25,149
the fairly promising technology

508
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:29,330
it's generally a good idea to you moved
the the functionality that you

509
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,629
need to have secured like a chip and pin
entry a

510
00:29:32,629 --> 00:29:36,090
out of a I'm trust device like the

511
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,100
your mobile phone into a more bespoke
device which

512
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,119
hopefully has less code unless attack
surface

513
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,440
maybe it's not a great idea to put a
full Linux distribution on their

514
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,320
I am and maybe you should also
considered the

515
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,000
to suffer security or any component such
implement almost devices

516
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,869
um muscle to flow so we've seen you have
seen

517
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:01,279
basic stock-based overflows have seen
Mon injection

518
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,570
does a box which resort we have
addressed especially in and that

519
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,570
best offense as a service-based I'm
bucks at have been exploited for more

520
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,610
than 20 years who

521
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:15,090
as real in no excuse for forestall
having those parts and assistance

522
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,629
and that was pretty much the same
situation that we've seen

523
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:22,080
on the traditional payment terminals as
well um

524
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,929
so these guys have to catch up on on on
so for security from the

525
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:30,419
from last 20 years in in order to I'm
address those

526
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,330
security vulnerabilities I'm

527
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,570
computer work for you really we plan to
look at

528
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,440
um what another really interesting
attack especially if you

529
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,470
exploit the tunnels through the gym be
back there would be done to exploit

530
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,610
mobile device

531
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,299
baxter's the Bluetooth vector which
would catch you remote capabilities as

532
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:52,559
well if you could communicate from the
mobile device through the internet

533
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,919
and send back any and Houston a.m. they
turned up in SoCo

534
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,309
over the channel so that some sinister
looking at

535
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:03,490
in a lot of the implementations of
applications to pollen assemblages

536
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,320
protocol

537
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,850
is actually implement native binary so
there's a lot of scope for

538
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,830
for something to go wrong about I'm as
i've seen only a technique to the rich

539
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,320
who

540
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,779
no which we didn't find any on our
abilities and that's the max right

541
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:19,220
a.m. swiping itself I'm the coat

542
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,629
handling the max what they ties very
limited

543
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:26,500
and even if you find us to a buffer
overflow or something like that and

544
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,779
you would need a very long a.m. card
which

545
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:32,909
might raise some suspicion that you said
in the shop

546
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:35,940
and obviously we're planning to to
implement a few more games on this as

547
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,879
well

548
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:40,270
maybe 2048 does

549
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,510
right a.m. any questions

550
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,619
wonderful presentation thank you so you
mentioned that they have no

551
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:52,909
update capability and you mentioned
didn't do persistence but would be

552
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:56,779
easy to do it persistence I'm jeff is a
salute

553
00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:00,830
I actually if you look at this time not
so so the PCI standards that apply for

554
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,779
those devices they were trial that the

555
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:06,510
applications the payment applications
are signed and that you wouldn't be able

556
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,039
to change the software

557
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:12,809
I'm no interest in the that apparently
doesn't applied to any livor resort to

558
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:15,929
trundle itself when it's like that so
that the cation assigned

559
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:19,270
and the signatures were checked on every
boot up but if you just swallowed a

560
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,200
binary

561
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,480
I'm yeah that would this %um Egypt's
persistence on the device

562
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,149
did you use basic counts to deploy the
payload

563
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:31,590
Yahoo firm note some reused basic parts
to

564
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:35,659
to implement explore the multitude to
implement the the %um be causing the

565
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:36,409
reused fun

566
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:40,649
like this and without using the
secondary Bluetooth

567
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:43,750
upload how much code could actually put
just on those on the ground

568
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,299
un saludo adoption we would have had is
to

569
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,480
just its you the first stage the the
reefer stage was

570
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,690
that comes with the data from the start
based of overflow can be almost

571
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,940
245 who that grumman

572
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm hoping that in the first stage
repair of the basic plot to send over

573
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,679
the next stages and chunks of

574
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,659
of wonderful forty-something bites so
that would be entirely possible that

575
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:08,539
bear

576
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:12,490
I think the the lot as the cards have a
storage of 62 K and

577
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,000
that should really be big enough for for
any page load that you want to deploy

578
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,770
with the parts

579
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,909
so weary use a Bluetooth a.m.

580
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:23,190
a second stage because bill lazy love

581
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:27,190
at that the entirely possible to have
everything office

582
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:31,639
and so you just mentioned you would have
to have a long credit cards and which

583
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:33,159
would raise suspicion

584
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:36,379
and for you know if you wanna exploit
the actual magnetic field reading

585
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:40,510
so now it becomes in the last month has
been becoming more popular to have

586
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,840
like iPhone cases at that store your
credit card

587
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,299
index trip and that play it back by
generating a magnetic field

588
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:50,849
to you know once that can have because
popular people are familiar with that

589
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:52,770
then you could just walk up with your
iPhone in

590
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:56,470
or you know whatever device you happen
just exploited because essentially then

591
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,609
they don't see use

592
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:01,700
wiping right to your just is only
through especially when

593
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,750
when merchants get used to that form of
payment more than

594
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,010
you would be able to exploit lot more
vulnerabilities and

595
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,700
expert awesomeness
