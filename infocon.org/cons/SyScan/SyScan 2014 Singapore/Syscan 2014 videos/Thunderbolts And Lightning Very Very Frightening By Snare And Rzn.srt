1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:04,620
I hey guys I we are going to talk to you
a little bit about some

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,950
Thunderbolt DNA attacks I and sorrow

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,990
let's get to it I this is Sam

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,880
it BEST bus bomb

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,619
hello hey I'm SEM on a pitch station at
the University of Auckland

6
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:23,730
and my research is on right racing on FB
yes

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,240
and I have an extensible collection
architects

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,550
here up nine tanks and hand it

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,479
on snail Lucas I am a computer

10
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,999
no as in the security with with me out
his

11
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:42,170
and I you might remember me from says
gun sight over at its own

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,920
I spoke a little bit about you if I
topic it's an insular

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,920
so the junk so I also I am

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,030
that's me in the corner down there I and
iPad the world's dumbest millionaire

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,559
if you believe my twitter profile I yes
sir

16
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,309
onto the more interesting stuff so %uh

17
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:04,140
basically we you know Sam and I both
independently

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,060
are decided to look into are doing DNA
attack south on the ball

19
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,730
I because apparently not only thing
everyone does know is that it's that

20
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,080
it's possible involve of

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,580
I witnesses in a row prefer concept that
wasn't

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,100
cheating with file ass are on San

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,230
is an FPGA that and in on the OS and

24
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,820
so my kinda guy so you know I was
looking into this and and I

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,880
realize their PJ's actually pretty hot
when you're so quick I

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,520
in or engineer I so said I at the other
end site working on this

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,870
together so on excited about lightning
the talk

28
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,210
Oslo in the slayings are seven on a one
in a

29
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,120
some like something ever yet arts are

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,330
that the things we're gonna go through
today are going to look at a background

31
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,060
about how

32
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,820
file I the attacks work on and while but
the limitations on what South

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,300
I'll those limitations we can overcome
using on the wall I

34
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,580
then lewd about on about how what's I

35
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,290
incense and go into a PCI Express the
inner workings and all that stuff

36
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,489
and how it the Jays do that thing and

37
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:13,019
then sort of how we can apply out that
too

38
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:16,870
attacking from the ball and then we're
going to a sweet snack demo with this

39
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,489
by ostentatious this equipment I am

40
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,849
and hopefully will work and if it
doesn't work probably will be a

41
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,549
and I guess because you know it seems
that there be the responsible thing to

42
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:28,849
do

43
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:35,590
talk a little about the fence yet so if
I like the attacks have been around for

44
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,930
quite a while now I guess

45
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,170
on metal song at a Middle Stone follow
down here that

46
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,579
eighty looking guy the Kiwi accent up
early one earth

47
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,659
three or four Metalheadz here I am

48
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,950
did some core work in about 2006 I am

49
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,719
call hit by a bus rutskoi astray a

50
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,090
I where he build a single when the piney

51
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,419
playing you know file to file out
computers together and

52
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,999
you know he's won so to do direct memory
access reads and writes the other one

53
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:09,889
on and who did this disegni was actually
first

54
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:14,409
I sort of this demonstrated by this
crazy Apple Michael Quinn the Eskimo

55
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:17,919
who either I send emails to you the
dollar

56
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,519
kernel mailing list him I've got some
release my answers from him before being

57
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,310
yelled at by

58
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,409
like channel one of those are the guys
that don't like a sack is I am

59
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:29,609
so he actually like talk to computers
the other viola and

60
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,639
used his attack machine to direct the
right to the framebuffer on the other

61
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,379
computer and

62
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,069
like bill the screensaver that was you
naked display on the other computer

63
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,719
the file just pretty badass you ask me
on

64
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,919
so the the Marlins on earth I
implementation this

65
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,400
technique or like nelson's will not find
type thing is

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,069
I inception which is a you know pretty
common tool for forensic analysis stuff

67
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,139
being plugged into

68
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,290
input to change your life I lines double
in a row on

69
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,779
are the fire alarm you know volatility
it out then I

70
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:03,999
dig out all the fun now and whatever
else so basically works by using ask BP

71
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:04,549
to

72
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:07,760
I which is a sorta part of the file I
specification

73
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,779
I the fire watch it says connected to
the PC

74
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:15,169
a bus and you know you year-round attack
jane tells the

75
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:19,480
I target machines file I chipset to do
DNA reads and writes on its behalf and

76
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,940
Sons backers flower

77
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,320
your face looks something like this: so

78
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,060
talk host with and CH Originals AC

79
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,100
units rather than to get file I chipset
on PCI bus

80
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,990
Marie controller and the memory you
connect the

81
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,100
analysis attackers depending on the
context of your research

82
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,610
or whatever I'll for a fire flower

83
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,690
and then over the sb2 protocol

84
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,340
the analysis or attack host I tells the

85
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,150
the remote file a chipset on to do a DNA
re

86
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,650
and then it goes and does it the PCI
Express bus

87
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,820
and then sends at Outback so piece I
thought

88
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,990
so the few limitations and file id: and
I I am

89
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,230
starters asked me if I learned a face
connors

90
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,380
you know out if they have now I guess on
you can

91
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,680
G if you've got a she with wonderful
just attach a file our I

92
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,150
isometric in that's still pretty easy I
guess I am

93
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,030
file or any is that it's a good
addressing I am sorry concern about the

94
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,150
lawful exit ramp

95
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,900
as some other extensions I it do are
things that I know all that much about

96
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,050
file asa

97
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,650
I'm more importantly the analyst at much
as my marriage

98
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,780
interest and sends an area interests are
file id: and I is disabled when

99
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,970
you follow all turned on and lock the
screen so the file I Drive a

100
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,350
arm has over the car that you know says
if

101
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,370
before and secure more in the car which
nah contexts

102
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,820
just means that you follow turned on I
when the screen is locked

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,210
tells a file a chipset beauty n anymore
that's an honor

104
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,460
time be that on SAR

105
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,660
basically Qatar black in a screen unlock
some hacks &

106
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,280
and memory dumping on a lot machine that
has followed turned on

107
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,370
and if you don't have all turned on you
deserve it sir

108
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,010
well so onto Thunderball

109
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,830
I on the ball is basically just PCI
Express

110
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,420
and sleep or glued together with a
couple of GK Airlines has another

111
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,980
signaling television where else and some
pixie dust

112
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,070
Intel proprietary magic sought to 1020
Gigabit

113
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,260
on full-duplex than 60 connection thing

114
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,760
eyes look really close them on from the
mocking doctor and they can see the

115
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,770
pixie dust

116
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,190
right there I am yeah

117
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,590
so which you know if you get a case I
can probably it's the PCI

118
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,430
in there somewhere we can provide to
send him a reads and writes directly

119
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,640
other PCI Express

120
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,340
dollars Thunder alright same's pretty

121
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,790
pretty sane I guess so with a slightly
more useful diagram here

122
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,960
I am with you know that the is %eh there

123
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,420
being I guess that the new South Bridge
and in the northridge being in the

124
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,860
I the processor and the final control
their collective of Alans

125
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,380
is expressed to the pch

126
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,450
yeah army

127
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,350
so basically the the Thunderbolt the
attacks with the DNA taxes seen so far

128
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,520
that have been done I over Thunderball

129
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,910
a pretty much just file I so people
taking out the Thunderbolt to firewire

130
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,870
adapter

131
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,310
talkin to file for an is using file
subject to the same limitations that

132
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,430
on all the machine with FireWire on
board on subject to

133
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,000
saw its you know exceptions as I can
spots under what does not support on the

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,320
ball

135
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,290
just you know allows you to use on the
mall connected device

136
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,570
with flour chips on and say it's its
base the subject to the same

137
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,700
stations so your so

138
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,620
says gonna go into a little bit of PCI
Express and workings

139
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,960
0 ahead so they say Express is basically
the love child

140
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,590
of PCI and PCI its I it's a serial

141
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,510
point went bus I and as Kansas alliance
and align

142
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,960
as transmit and receive differential yet

143
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,330
so their time love for wise per line and

144
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,970
ice a differential pairs so
complimentary signal switch

145
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,570
reduce Cana loss are increase resistance
to Electromatic

146
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,889
noise on like a high-speed bus

147
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:32,159
that's our the number lines a style and
it's negotiated

148
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,440
at like set up time typically to the
maximum

149
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,310
number lines that both devices can spoil

150
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,060
as a lie ahead at that place transaction
park outside

151
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,700
is a physical a what's contained so you
clocking and your centralization

152
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,440
resources on is a doddle in class which
is all your

153
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,510
I'm transaction a limiting and power
management stuff

154
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,960
and is a transaction i watch I'll talk
about on the net site

155
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,640
I also supports level since a or message
signalled interrupts

156
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,240
so on that transaction lather for
transaction types

157
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,020
at is an irate right which is just
legacy stuff to support

158
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,740
for backwards compatibility with a CI
their configuration reads and writes

159
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,710
whatcha

160
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,430
reason rights to their configuration
spice on each device

161
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,450
and this configuration spice basically
consigns

162
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,560
capabilities at the status and control
registers for the device

163
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,240
add his memory reads and writes whatcha
you know that's that's a transfer

164
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
daughter on the bus

165
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,060
its best were interested in yet and is
messaging

166
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,210
site today DMI on PCI Express you hook
up your device

167
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,710
the operating systems going to rate from
the configuration spice to figure out

168
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,360
the

169
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,710
device ID in the interactive the
divisive thing on a

170
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,150
lowered at the a driver further those I
days if it has one

171
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,430
and that drivers can a guy and run this
device

172
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,680
as a bus master which means it can do it
as reads and writes

173
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,660
I once it's done that the driver were
right anti-gun addresses

174
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,720
and the command at once the device today
i would tell it to stop

175
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,610
and the device cars and I'm does the
memory reads and writes

176
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,810
and interrupts the operating system when
it's finished

177
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,020
side an FPGA as a field programmable
guys right

178
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,130
it's like a programmable integrated
circuit and I were invented by Xilinx

179
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,250
that in 1984 I'm

180
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,910
their matrix comfortable logic blocks
which I'm

181
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,170
act in time slices and your typical
slice contains

182
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,420
I look at tables flip flops carry China
and multiplexers

183
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,390
and this is like the core functionality
attorney fees yet

184
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,060
sorry for each device family there are
also

185
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,100
additional generic features like block
grams

186
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,570
five fires this space and parking
resources like

187
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,810
eyes locked loops and a CNN's meaning
you can have

188
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,320
lots a different act clock frequencies
running all around aboard a different

189
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,080
party a larger

190
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,960
and in specific two-inch Connor at the
boss

191
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,920
there are things like PCI Express core
anything iCore

192
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,660
ordeal yet so i three controller things
that

193
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,490
that it's easy to implement direct hard
with four

194
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,060
rather than implements and logic has a
that requires a lot higher speed than

195
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,310
that a poet BJ

196
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,010
ever and they're also a reprogrammable

197
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,390
which is a really big advantage
re-election dissect when you are

198
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,800
designing a party talking something cuz

199
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,570
I'm you know you who also you can I'm
send updates your device once it's been

200
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,720
might like you can

201
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,320
to send out a a new but stream to your
device reprogram

202
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,339
if you've got an update to I get your
update your bookmark your

203
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:55,120
innocent on this train in the OS in a
very modern overall you know

204
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,690
can be up there independently yep and
it's also a light

205
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:05,690
the generally cheaper than dissect and
on a small to medium volumes

206
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,240
Sarhadi turn a logic like how do you
implement that arne

207
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,290
a jet so save got this logic up here on
the left hand side

208
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,210
basically what you gonna do it in a run
through every single combination of and

209
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:17,910
but

210
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,490
and determine the output for that logic
so that's going to be the street I'm

211
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,550
like you've got here

212
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,830
and then use the up for that truth title
just the right hand column

213
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,250
and you can use that to nationalize the
the lookup table on the official yet

214
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,390
site essentially the lookup table as a
sex and put memory

215
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,500
and it contains the output for each set
authors

216
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,310
addresses all inputs and so it really
doesn't matter

217
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,550
how complex logic is it can be far more
complex than this

218
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,240
but as long as it's got sex that suck
some putts

219
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,320
you know you can implement it on a lot a
lot a single look at times as well

220
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,700
so to I'm describing logic use a
hardware description language like

221
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,720
turlough VXL

222
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,670
I'm so you can you can write this VHDL
or Verilog

223
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,170
and you leave it up to a synthesis tool
to I'm to in Farrell the logic that you

224
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,890
want and you look at tables

225
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,080
but it's really important to understand
how the underlying iffy jessup works

226
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,060
because

227
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,990
I'm you know you're not running not
really running software you configuring

228
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,110
the hardware Sony

229
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,620
you really want to know what the card
you're running is actually gonna turn

230
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,850
into otherwise you get

231
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,660
like horribly performing logic a few up
like really care less what you cut

232
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,850
site the maximum performance or the
frequency

233
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,060
up your I'm design is determined by the
not the levels of logic there a

234
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:46,260
and a-level a budget is a combination of
logic to lie and routing the lie

235
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,910
but trying to flip flops or cyprus
elements in your design

236
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,279
say look at taiwan and the light that
psych test at constant property of

237
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,870
you're the boss the using

238
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,330
and the rationalizing is determined by
how close you ply so you're

239
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,940
logic to each other sucks you reduce
your levels of logic

240
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,680
or you can place your look at times us
together you can get up a

241
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,850
high-performance

242
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,260
haha clock frequency

243
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,310
so one other thing you cannot implement

244
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,640
on a PC I is as for marketplace and it's
a

245
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,580
it's a marker controller vernon like
Britain in VHDL

246
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,040
and it's really I'm yeah and devices on
a

247
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,000
what's going on i excite us and that's a
standard and five so you can hook up

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,180
lots of other things too and he met them

249
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,770
and yes right card and say oh say plus
plus

250
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,089
Compal until now and I all you're doing
is during raids and writes on this bus

251
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:39,580
and

252
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,910
I'm it's really good for it's really
good for control logic

253
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,240
and where previously it have to write
really large site machines in HCl much

254
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,890
Akbar care prior and had to be back as
we found a cutie gun

255
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,230
without dancers in the didn't work yeah
I and it also means

256
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,000
you know that your software developer or
someone can write tired

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,399
and maintain card for your design as
well I this snag I

258
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,040
here that turns out a few years ago haha
when your software guy

259
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,450
it you know vs young girl look like card
the really it's

260
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,870
inner engineering so Anna

261
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,660
sorry you can also connect to the market
place's via serial

262
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,240
and get a console up on a and she
confronts if they buy

263
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,830
your logic which is really really handy
like

264
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,940
he's been to the ship Scott yeah he's
been a bit I'm using chips cut

265
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,120
which is you basically putting a logic
analyzer inside the FPGA

266
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,360
as really really had to take on a
trigger on events which you wanna Martyn

267
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,950
capture the right kinda stuff it's
really painful

268
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,160
site being our print if everything is
your the israelis

269
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,140
were when we're developing the first
measure the San with was at my place

270
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,640
where we keep the burden is on an answer
as a character witness in a most the

271
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,410
time

272
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,740
looking at at the apt bike those chips
got up with love

273
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,920
PCI Express packets captured are using
just go

274
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,620
and looking at individual it's an area
that's a to of

275
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,709
its is not know why shocking nothing

276
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:07,560
had it's really hard to debug this kinda
stuff

277
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,560
so how do PCI Express on an FPGA

278
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,089
I will as all installed to that ok it
that way using has a

279
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,750
IX an intentional cuz night tall ship
really is

280
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,120
at to change his shit yet I'm

281
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,690
sorry it's gonna a PCI coal which we can
hook up to

282
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,390
XI bus and it uses those device specific
features to implement

283
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,860
I that much the title in class

284
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,260
of PCI Express for us son's memory met

285
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,250
and so any raise all rights we do I i XI
right to the score

286
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,980
that's going to translate them into
those member rating: right tail pays on

287
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,040
the transaction by sparse

288
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,440
and then any reads all rights what's
coming from PCI Express

289
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,790
its gonna translate to rate some rights
on the XI pass for us

290
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,660
labonte peripherals like soft haha
peripherals loss a black sizes

291
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,069
protease is gonna take someone else's
car smoking cause or or or

292
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,410
you know existing silence I P and inner

293
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,240
hooking up thanks I busing you know you
can talk to for market place from Saints

294
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,740
their classically yet site

295
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,790
on bicycling to attack Thunderball

296
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,799
Autotech a Mac using PCI Express

297
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,699
win we need to become Bassmaster first
so we can do all these words are so we

298
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:25,420
won

299
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,420
so this is the cana a this is kinda how
we want

300
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,580
act it's a lot like we've got a target
host here with us on the bottom dollar

301
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,960
on a

302
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,610
and gonna stay in the PCI Express bus
using K

303
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,110
a thunderbolts PCI Express adapter look
it up sorry

304
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,820
as yet so what we actually end up worth

305
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,400
next as us here

306
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,940
passing said the that I but it's
important to know is that they saw the

307
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,280
pics

308
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,120
is Alice's extended out from Lockport
comes out the other side at the outside

309
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,929
the other

310
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,940
on the mall chipset so it's basically
you know you're actually its bases and

311
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,240
sticking a PCI Express card into the
machine

312
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,260
but its you know o'clock whatever also
spotlights Prescott or

313
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,770
your PC I'll yeah

314
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,860
so this is what we end up worthless not
we're going to target host they're

315
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,530
connected via Thunderbolt

316
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,850
so I R on Thunderbolt PCI Express
adapter

317
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,870
and the DSL 22 10 on there that's the

318
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,630
the thats Thunderbolt controller I we
can make that

319
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,200
in via PCI Express to know if he had
developed boat

320
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,540
and on that we've implemented that XI
PCI or

321
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,700
am i hook it up to marketplace which we
then talk to you via syria on our house

322
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,200
is highest

323
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,420
side the circuitry handles the that
physical liar

324
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,100
PCI Express and this excite me sacco
handles a darling last for us

325
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,440
we right and thus a for those market
lies

326
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,900
was does reads and writes that cool
which performs ours reason right side

327
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,830
piece express

328
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,250
to but I i sparse

329
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,600
so the this the pressure taken here I

330
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,870
as you know what we sow got RR the you
know if the Jets airport

331
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,299
to connect up to PCI Express connected
into the Mac by Thunderball

332
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:13,630
so what we need to do is some I

333
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,230
somehow become bus master so originally
what we wanted to just honest

334
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,820
get started and I get testing with is
our wrote a car driver for

335
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,110
for Mac OS that I you know makes

336
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,740
makes out unit example and then and then
set it with the with the bus master

337
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,070
enable flag and then

338
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,530
I will communicate with it via you know
%ah I space

339
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:36,660
reads and writes are to that the FPGA
two registers in

340
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,799
a custom my cum 57 Sam Roecker for

341
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:43,720
on and to tell it what to do directly
from our drive so it's

342
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,720
it's pretty easy to interface with well
I was pretty easy to my face with

343
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,090
at the in the early stages the
development stuff on

344
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,630
then I so base which eating and because
we're

345
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,020
you know that that the idea is that
we're not gonna have access to

346
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,350
the house or attacking sir we're
catching my talking to it and can

347
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,179
configure and other

348
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:05,730
over unlock connection site the next
phase was to animate advice

349
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,540
I a legitimate device that I its whose
driver

350
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,390
will sell fast last line and let you
know gonna go to town

351
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,010
on the day and ice sorrow we chose the
Apple

352
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,220
SDXC device has it was sports

353
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,360
as the IBC out on flag driver which
means it's allowed to be connected to

354
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,179
the Thunderball

355
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:30,429
I and then so basically just set in the
FPGA and config registers set their

356
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,110
device ID and then dried a

357
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,419
to match that advice and of you know
enough configuration to you

358
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,370
on to satisfy Iraq its matching
requirements so that when I like it

359
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,660
you know that's the device it goes
against PCI device Scott this pen

360
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,470
artists this product id:

361
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,360
go through a liar get matching bullshit
with her crazy where that works and

362
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,950
fines

363
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,309
this have less taxi driver closet the
drug Azilect

364
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,910
ex-con like my class at school and and
set/sets pasta

365
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,380
yep so on so the actual %ah

366
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,270
like prof. concept other show you surely
on-base the prof concept is

367
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,690
I pretty much the way that inception
looks I and

368
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,780
we had we taken a mission slot its on as
running but its

369
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,830
the screen is locked and we're gonna are

370
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,660
right search through memory and find the
piece a car that's responsible for the

371
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,510
authentication

372
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,740
on mechanisms are every time any
authentication

373
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,390
happens in on Mac OS ago sir Open
Directory whether it's you know

374
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,630
all that or its fat fast %uh for its
miss or whatever

375
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,809
I overthrew this the same this once and
retain that checks

376
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:38,490
your goes through and works out and
directors configuration is and does the

377
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:38,860
actual

378
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,309
an occasion and then it returns I just
you know a one or a0 to say

379
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:46,650
yes you're allowed to log in or no
you're not allowed to log in I

380
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,000
so that'll the car there were basically
just patch it so that

381
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,660
them om move copy be on sale

382
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,770
eyes just move one into hell so just
orangutans

383
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,830
1 and especially on such much as well on

384
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,990
this is not same pay lurks ahead we
actually are on the road this

385
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,830
originally for 10 10a and then realize I
got him didn't have a 10 a.m. Shane

386
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,160
so last night we're at an odd build a
new pilot in reverse the

387
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,750
I the Open Directory I'm function for 9

388
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,780
yes sir but I am it all works that's
fine

389
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,620
helped have a couple beers happy on
service the after I can type in what are

390
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,720
the password one hit and dialogue in

391
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,049
right so this is a if the gentleman
board here

392
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:33,690
that's right here but we carry home in
arkansas alliance yeah

393
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,690
and so that that's available there that
this they actually is yes I

394
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,870
the inset it's pretty small compared to
the size the blood

395
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,260
but there's a whole other island for a
frozen things on there

396
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,280
and power management or like us up

397
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,450
and this is the Thunderbolt BC I bought
which um

398
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,760
the vendors since recalled all the day's
and I

399
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,410
offered me twice what I paid for and
vouch for their webstore if I sent back

400
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,250
to them

401
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,720
site number I I want that there's a good
reason you wanna back

402
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,010
I'm and after talking to some people
intel i suspect

403
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,160
that perhaps they're trying to the
Thunderbolt certification and a don't

404
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,419
want any their engineering samples out
in the wild anymore

405
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:16,940
sir or the inning so to set he I'm

406
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,049
so we can take that to the the and about
to the

407
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:23,620
the development board by at the pace
Express Canada

408
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,610
assignments like a typical graphics that
and the mechanic that

409
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,950
Animal Planet two of two at Target I on
FPGA also connects the giant egg and you

410
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,010
not to

411
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,620
are texting they say and so the day
tense used to program the PJ

412
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,530
and the US we commit to cereal to the
marketplace

413
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:49,509
then reconnect a no vote to the rectum

414
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:54,799
SAR a in case you missed that we got cap
hill that give us a little explanation

415
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:01,129
soundest

416
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:04,279
back I don't even hear that where that

417
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:07,779
that sucks out in swine was finally
finally said sound up

418
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:14,779
as fairly only one for I so it

419
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:20,980
away sir I now well that's actually of
the apartment another demory at that

420
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,940
time like soda

421
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,799
that's our song sway II them a time to

422
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:30,659
in console me P please be

423
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,940
up are thanks Mel

424
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,739
at I bring up this airplane so I

425
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:41,369
so what we gonna do is we've got are arm
this guy

426
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:45,279
yeah co-counsel so are two seasons grain

427
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,100
to connect to the you are over the USB
connected

428
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,720
connection thing it's it's great bike
USB UART the USB 0 chip

429
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,519
want to talk to you out are so here we
have down lot

430
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:00,119
I was a how does this chin but that's a

431
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,840
Sandy Bridge machine so its 2011 or
something like that it's running 10 onto

432
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,169
are so we're gonna hook up on about 20
now

433
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:10,259
maybe a plea

434
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,929
away or

435
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,249
so ship early elections Mr failing of

436
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,409
so he just like in like in a some stuff

437
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:24,230
and here and there isn't more space into
a tan it doesn't get right so that's

438
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,409
clearly not the password

439
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:30,549
here and it's its clinical I'm so glad I
change my sir

440
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:35,029
password from space but the massager I
was cheating

441
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:41,379
thanks metal the best whatcha gonna get
metal stone to help us out by an

442
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:42,529
oncoming typing in

443
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:46,690
a down the password and second as well
alright so with what up

444
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,779
we've hooked up on the altar up other so
the top line is the pace express link

445
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:52,559
coming up

446
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,309
and second-line is the driving going
this bus master and now we're free to do

447
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:57,649
whatever we want so

448
00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:01,299
think we're gonna want to go and yes i'd

449
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,700
this is the part written on the market
place just alittle

450
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,320
function of stuff within the and so
we're gonna go on like this

451
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,279
the smack so it's gonna scan through all
the membrane

452
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,389
looking for this pen found a match since
patched up with that

453
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:20,749
return 1 I wish that run till the end

454
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:23,909
because it can find a couple these and
membrane or

455
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:27,309
finds the pen somewhere else and that is
something that my the

456
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:31,330
thank but manager if I think it is a
little bit but pack ice on it found one

457
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:31,909
now

458
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:35,519
am will need a volunteer to come and
enter a password for us

459
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:41,240
maybe not your own password

460
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,240
first just met that's fine your password

461
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,240
I at alright and a slaughter

462
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:02,580
and so glad that worked yeah I apologize
for the artist

463
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,920
what ever sign lol

464
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,140
at yeah so

465
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,470
we also know dr. arm which will also
shared I but the public she had to say

466
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,600
all this stuff from where I S II here's

467
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,340
video at the same time is me using SPICE
to trial again

468
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:27,340
not working third ok it up you gonna say
the same stuff there on the console

469
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,600
like comes up gets bus master gonna

470
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:38,980
terminal type unlock

471
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,870
far searching searching searching tandem
action it's best that

472
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,650
I was livid

473
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:52,530
let it go through again am gonna try

474
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,500
spices the password again once the went
as fast

475
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,050
Amr

476
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:04,850
victory on a a nice

477
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,690
up

478
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:14,640
her a sup

479
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:21,640
on this all our this all seems kinda bad
right

480
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,810
and doesn't seem like a great thing to
be able to do so

481
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,230
in to realize this a while ago are arm
sort of

482
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,640
they yeah I so basically there's there's
there's a few

483
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,290
you know a few few as in when we can
purge fixing this problem so in global

484
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,560
shot which is obviously not really
appropriate on you know you got my think

485
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:38,990
it is

486
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,350
I think it is by you know people that
unknown people use computers probably

487
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,780
dime

488
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,540
at my my travel machine by the way I
actually broke the Thunder or I think I

489
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,730
killed the convo control and we're doing
this stuff

490
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,320
arm early on and out now on the bottom
works out perfect travel at all

491
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,270
don't have to clear the ball shot aren't
so

492
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,380
next option for pre not going on because
I guess arm

493
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,840
so into access controls on on on the
glasses otherwise i right

494
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,940
so in Selma this thing called the TD

495
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,590
on which they I mean the heck

496
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,870
its that for them its virtualization
technology it's cut

497
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:17,970
kind of side-effect I get your politics
after securing our design for

498
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,720
arm you know partitioning the IRS pay
service its virtualized

499
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,990
I R so the hypervisor can now take a
device and assign it directly to a VM

500
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,750
guests ask onto the way that on the
indirect of works and you know all those

501
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,020
similar conserve arm differently name
technologies that are all exactly the

502
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,720
same thing

503
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,200
so the VM the NM can can assign a device
to

504
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,260
I to it to our guest Andy America West's

505
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,840
and interrupts are already mapped by the
end that the VTA unit so on

506
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,630
the city the the city unit they say has
these

507
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:55,400
I the way 'cause domains which is you
know I really that tend to map on 212 am

508
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,470
two guests and ordered it to our to the
M's

509
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,700
including the highest as always at least
one demand which is the host a man

510
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,490
us are that the highest PM's demand I
guess

511
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,590
on at so in order to actually sign

512
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,460
a device to a guest via the enhanced
credit demands that I guess then

513
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,670
assigned to us to it

514
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,630
and then are you know all the other
devices go in the house tonight so that

515
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,700
you know that 129

516
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,700
I then get society to the guest and I
can access the device

517
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,250
and no one else tax so

518
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,750
Mac OS actually configures eighty

519
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,330
I unit a three-tier PCI family driver

520
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:37,440
so when it gets loaded as I can look at
the source codes for Kobe did it say

521
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,580
to huge fucking mess some what a comment
%uh carton

522
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,600
now that is horrible pretty funny I am

523
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,770
the SOS the distress want was the same
with it in a two-man

524
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,330
I mean yards it's not really haha as a
as such but its you know wants to use it

525
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,720
as a security mechanism so

526
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,940
Kratz's one single the man on I

527
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,230
yet and and assigns all the devices to a
on yang also

528
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,200
lax controls two devices within that
demands of so base now when it when

529
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,800
drivers allocate DMA buffers

530
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,400
on in order to communicate with their
device the device can you deny rights

531
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,210
you know it's a graphics card can inner
ride the image back out to the a.m

532
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,210
the framebuffer also reactor smile on a
dental office

533
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:22,510
thing when I went when it when it and
medium demographers out and buy the

534
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,670
drive up the Connell

535
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,800
allocator she tells me today and about
that region says this is

536
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,590
in this region should be allowed to
written to buy this device amendment

537
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,460
from by this device and that's all

538
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,760
service now in DNA request coming on the
PC

539
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,980
a PCIe bus and they go through that on
the city in it

540
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,490
it just sorta says yay or nay %ah to

541
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,910
22 each other quests so if you're if
your device to access

542
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,650
RTC on these messages it in the fall in
your

543
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,110
I in your console he actually said a on

544
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,940
a in the NPC I I flack without said

545
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,150
fall in that happens like this are
that's not panic when it happens

546
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:04,440
which is not fun and we saw a lot some
somewhat to the ASM were developing this

547
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,630
I so this basically what I just said I
see the device

548
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:12,300
Texas PCI bus and then it goes now
through the beat it beat it a unity

549
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,440
inside the the on top of it all up
angers

550
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,920
into the sea view site BT gets first
dibs on telling you get fucked

551
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,990
so this is actually now on all

552
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,020
machines of so 2012 Sean woods including
this this

553
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,290
presentation one are so I coverage on
what's

554
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,410
as well as well as as well yeah on
requires operating system

555
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,790
because I said the council actually set
up it's not just a you know

556
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,870
for free Hobbit I am control

557
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,270
on say it has the means that the these
tricks don't work on

558
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,890
a new machine running new OS on at

559
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,230
as it was added to our that or stands I

560
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,380
PCI family driver in 10 08:02 so if
you're running

561
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,860
Ivy Bridge 11 Jan with tonight two or
later Europe that

562
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,920
on I think windows before Windows 8 and
Windows 8 11

563
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,470
song for the correct feature produced
from the correct me I think it doesn't

564
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,780
actually integrated it also it would
still be on herbal

565
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,240
Zara yep thanks

566
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,070
arm their looking for around for not
missing back to thank me

567
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,450
arm let exactly does a much better job
of configuring BTN it like its current

568
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,130
hates cleanup apparently

569
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,679
says and his through at tonight in a yet
so it actually set up at the Mann I do

570
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:29,020
know

571
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,380
couple things about the scent of me set
up at the main I'm per

572
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,450
like per device or whatever and you know
has more fine-grained access controls

573
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,060
yes so the EPL basically cut a la Cite

574
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,170
so at the mine is I look at it on our
device

575
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:48,110
on pace expressed by I to wear it sets
the pace express train

576
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,910
and the apple cart only has one demand
like everything is under the same demand

577
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,910
where's the limits card is really nice
abkhazia

578
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,450
although a haha elisa stuff that uses
basically for

579
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,790
and actually sits up the mines probably
any uses more than one

580
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,110
yet so that's basically what I just said

581
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,169
arm in a if you run a new machine with
new software okay

582
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:13,129
and if you're running a new machine
without subway silly engine upgrade it

583
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:14,750
I'm sure I'll machine

584
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,010
year you know as you bring us thanks
senators machinery in

585
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,280
your provincial I

586
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,300
so that's that's pretty much it on the
internet like the next steps for this

587
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,350
research obviously going to be to make
this

588
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,440
monstrosity a little bit smaller arm

589
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,929
this is in are far more hardware than is
actually required was an off-the-shelf

590
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:38,860
our development board with a huge number
peripherals that we are using

591
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,250
like in asset-based often organ
mezzanine paying in my was on the junk

592
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,740
and an external I unable to PCI Express
ports are

593
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,480
I think you know we'll probably build a
on a small boats just

594
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,770
a FPGA from a controller

595
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:57,120
bus powered you know nice and neat arm
and obviously

596
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,380
I it doesn't actually required a the
attacking computer

597
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,560
to be present which is using it to talk
to talk to have a serial you know the

598
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,590
demonstration

599
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,150
sorta visibility purposes answer it
could probably be a pretty

600
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,350
small self-contained awesome plugin
press button

601
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,220
unlock screen or pro plugin with SDXC
card in

602
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,190
arm dumbell memory to a stick seek out
so that's probably

603
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,960
when the next steps also we look at BT
in a little detail

604
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,610
on getting to know the park outside name
it may be that some our future research

605
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,140
on there's been a few other people have
done some interesting our papers in

606
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,870
talks and stuff about in last year's

607
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,530
like invisible things that said and some
other dudes on a

608
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,620
and some cool stuff I am maybe

609
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,990
I say we can not require driver finds
all the tricks

610
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,110
on and pro forma captures a it's
actually useful volatility

611
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,370
on because at the moment it's pretty
much just a start hack sir

612
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,760
your so it so good

613
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,860
few references there's probably more
things should add to that but on

614
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,560
it is that you might be more hi there
and the place express specification

615
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,910
I yeah it's a great way to fall asleep
at nine

616
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,820
the beat anyone's actually really
exciting as well

617
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,370
um I think that's pretty much about it
on

618
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,370
mad props at arm's length being a legend
and

619
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,650
letting us come in destroyed Sam for
again on

620
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,870
Britain was like yes i ka blame my
hangover on him saw

621
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,109
glamorous qualia Thomas sergei me was
kiosks are kicked out the ball last

622
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:26,600
night sir

623
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,080
on yeah thanks to all those people and
stuff

624
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,920
agreed Mr overslept up to sympathize for
Xilinx tool sucking

625
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,710
experience and I can do that as well and
i really sympathize yeah on digital

626
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,630
screen generation

627
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,910
take usually I is usually a few hours on
other some

628
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,770
those devices except for in small the
bitstream to a megabyte

629
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,540
but that's tight around half an hour
year and my you anywhere

630
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,030
have got a much bigger is PJ Anya can
take

631
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,590
12 24 hours to Jen are the best time
your time

632
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,670
abusive will clock speed did could you
guys achieve on the FPGA because in PCI

633
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,609
Express runs at a pretty high clock

634
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:08,140
great right yes oh this is a like a
lower generation if is yes and that's

635
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,609
why it's got those device specific
features

636
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:14,490
as I P sacks process run at 250
megahertz so its car

637
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,859
specific hardware on there that can run
that fast that doesn't logic

638
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:20,940
and I think we entice further than a
hundred megahertz

639
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,710
side yet pretty it's pretty easy to
achieve a hundred megahertz

640
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,000
but so fifties a lot on a bus to us

641
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,290
Anna how did you disconnect the microbe
list to the PCI Express port

642
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,120
the it's connected to the serial

643
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,120
it's connected to cereal city you out on
the board and it's connected to the

644
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,880
Exide PCI thing what's

645
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,410
is what has actually connected to the PC
I express

646
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,840
poor yet yet so the marketplace

647
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,120
doesn't directly connected to there's
that XI bus

648
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,970
and XI Corps and between a

649
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,630
his loss last question %ah soul which
part

650
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:05,660
your system sent to the american lasted
the 101 or is it

651
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,980
is it Michael bliss was a sense that the
American West

652
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,340
I know it's that I X I PCI core there's
like a

653
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,790
the day and I thing to that which is
memory mapped on that bus

654
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,590
which you know you write to con the same
why the driver does

655
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,040
telling the other device what to do and
so

656
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,590
cars and it does that and then
interrupts the marketplace

657
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:31,960
when it's done an attack soul into is
actually 128 makes a

658
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,370
ddr2 on here and it puts it all in there

659
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,150
so that the whole design of of using out
my control the micro blaze

660
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,640
bus and then FPGA I'm is that just you
did that just because you're development

661
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,900
board just had a FPGA or is it

662
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,620
Isner just much easier to use a normal
my controller or arm

663
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,540
or whatever attach it to an FPGA by a
bus

664
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,630
I'm you know why why you know implement
ft

665
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,890
my controller in in on the FPGA arts
just a lot easier to

666
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,970
Connor the Amorites a card a

667
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,080
masher and I'll stand by my controller
just on

668
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,330
get why not a normal my country will
pick a big bass with what he said

669
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,530
the devil we have doesn't have a
microcontroller I bought but that is the

670
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,080
its does play a budget better it to
implement ER marker controller

671
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,460
as market players on right now trying to
vie sur I was in if we're building

672
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,550
something scratch

673
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,280
we made use the hardware you know hard
marker control you know it's Inc

674
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,370
arm are chip that has a hot you know I'm
yet or something like that

675
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,760
a disaster because the DDK that nato's
that

676
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,120
years a encore wishbone the net PDA I
mean I'm not sure if he would be able to

677
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,400
run PCI on that you probably have to
have like a

678
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,890
dedicated FP PCI module again because
it's not fast enough but

679
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,150
I think the arm deputy are they using
medicaid can do

680
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,820
on the Express so you would need to have
an external device again a connected by

681
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,620
a some other

682
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,880
BIOS gasket thanks

683
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,950
yes i'd having a marcar Cana

684
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,800
on and your fabric as so common in fact
that

685
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,950
Xilinx have made a a chip wealth a
dedicated

686
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:08,440
joke I'm gonna sites of the news that
the

687
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,480
then our while mass of us and hot like
that's on hardware

688
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,890
and they're like my run at one gigahertz
as opposed to as running at one made

689
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,930
ahead sir

690
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,109
there at 100 megabits

691
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,120
what was the year device that you're
actually emulating the

692
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,030
the mistaking the Apple as the Apple
SDXC slot

693
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:31,060
says the on SD card slot basically

694
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,720
and them are there other devices that
you could alternatively use which made

695
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,050
it much more access

696
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:39,280
I am yet quite possibly on what we

697
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,500
that's that's another thing that we saw
to start to look into as well i cum

698
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,810
the the different men I regions and the
DNA officer al Qaeda but different

699
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,280
devices

700
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,500
device driver so I kept GB you by al
Qaeda

701
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,600
bigger DNA but as it gets bigger when
there's a memory we can actually access

702
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,410
with the T word

703
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,710
been really go into you know actually
the fine-grained

704
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,720
nature %ah the way the city limits are
access but on

705
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,190
yet at this still certain memory regions
we can access arm

706
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,700
using a driver but there's probably more
with other driver says you know possibly

707
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,830
also you know go through a whole Series
drivers and see what what memory gins I

708
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,510
can access in and read them all

709
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:20,620
so and have no excellent talk whether
you made a picture working a Mac

710
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,050
up the the BMI yes I

711
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,210
jazz is another question did you try a

712
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,270
and make the transceiver a

713
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,000
you know do where staff in the past so
also you

714
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,830
basically a two-out transceiver forcing
we'd only have

715
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,990
on on this poll that there's not a lot
to access that back on level

716
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:43,260
stock is that the actual transceiver is
implemented in hardware

717
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,730
Inspiron 6000 the runs and 100 megahertz
as an said so

718
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,700
dade you don't really have a lot of
access to to change the promise that you

719
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,360
using a

720
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,410
like watkins exw arm over text whatever
you could

721
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:57,650
for all you know other platforms arm
that that have

722
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,640
are high clock speed we can actually
implement the transceiver in budget then

723
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,650
you probably yet we have explored that
all bids

724
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,070
it seems like an interesting I interest
interesting thing was gore as well
