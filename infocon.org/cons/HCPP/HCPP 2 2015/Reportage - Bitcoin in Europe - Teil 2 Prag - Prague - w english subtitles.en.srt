00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello and Welcome to our second part of our documentary series: Bitcoin in Europe

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,400
The team of BTC-ECHO travels to various cities in europe

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,980
to talk to people from businesses and politics about Bitcoin and bBlockchain

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,380
We're now on our way to the Bitcoin & Blockchain Conference here in Prag

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,740
and we're looking forward for exciting interviews

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,320
made by

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,600
We're here at crypviser's booth at Bitcoin & Blockchain Conference Prague

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,040
Next to me is Sergey from Crypviser, Hello Sergey! - Hello

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,760
Can you explain to us, what is crypviser and what is your team doing?

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,680
Yes! Crypviser is an all-in-one communication platform

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,900
which is solving the problems of their customers and leads them on their way

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,840
in reference to secure communication, data storage and encryption

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,000
we're offering a communication platform which tackles these problems and which takes these very seriously

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,820
it makes sure that we have a secure communication between users

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,900
through our own designed protocols

16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,119
Okay and what are you doing specifically to provide this? What are your tools?

17
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,620
The tools are the well known SALSA 20/20 protocols

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,540
the most advanced tools that are being used today, which are modified by us for our own protocol

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:40,720
because the public key exchange, the centerpiece of asymmetric cryptography is problematic, and we're offering a solution to this with our own protocol

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,539
Okay and what about the progress? Are you planning to do an ICO? What's in the plan?

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,400
Yes, we're coming up with an ICO for our app for August 1st

22
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,180
An ICO which is seperately for our CV coin is dated prior to that

23
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,460
the app is still in internal alpha stage

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,580
you can also test it today, we got it on our phones

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,760
the development takes progress

26
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,900
and we're quite confident that we can demonstrate a product in august

27
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,380
Exciting! Last question: what's up with the coins?

28
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,840
Do they have a purpose, or are they just stake?

29
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,079
Yes, absolutely! In our case the coins do not only have a physical worth, but also a purpose

30
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,560
to provide our customers with anonymity

31
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,940
we connected the coins to our subscription model

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,320
the premium version is set for 9,99 €/month

33
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,840
this will in turn get calculated back in 10 CV coins

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,440
and for this the price calculates to 9,99€/coin

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,900
for us it's not only important to make an ICO that brings a certain coin

36
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,180
the coin represents the security and authenticity of crypviser

37
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,520
the coin enables the customer to get our premium features anonymously

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,360
Great! Thanks for the interview! - Thank you too!

39
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,780
Here at the Institute of Cryptoanarchy we got a Bitcoin ATM

40
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,859
and this is a two-way Bitcoin ATM, which means I am not only able to buy but also sell Bitcoin

41
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,560
I just opened my Jaxx wallet and I will sell some Bitcoin and receive Czech Crowns

42
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,879
I already set up "german" and press "sell bitcoins"

43
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,440
and I see, I want less than 15.000 Czech Crowns

44
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:36,400
How many do I want? I just select 1.000 Czech Crowns

45
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
That's 0.02 Bitcoin

46
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,280
Alright, sell Bitcoins

47
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,280
"Do you want to keep track of the transaction via SMS?" - I don't need that right now, it's pretty fast anyways

48
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,440
okay, alright. I asked to sell my Bitcoins

49
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,600
I have to send the Bitcoins in less than 45 minutes

50
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,780
I got an adress here

51
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,340
and to this adress I have to send this amount

52
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,360
I got my wallet here and I press "send"

53
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,120
I just scan the QR-code

54
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:14,639
the QR-code got scanned and it automatically sets up the amount that I have to send

55
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,920
so i don't have to manually enter the amount

56
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,900
because the QR-code already did it for me

57
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,640
I press "send"

58
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,360
alright, I confirm this

59
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
alright, got confirmed

60
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,080
I just send Bitcoins to this adress

61
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,340
and this machine has a little camera

62
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,880
I got my QR-code here and I present it to the camera

63
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,380
Alright, it received the code

64
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,260
you see, transaction was successful

65
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,420
now it ejects money

66
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,400
"Please take the money from the ejector, it will arrive in some seconds"

67
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,860
the machine is working as you can hear

68
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,220
and I got 1.000 Czech Crowns while selling Bitcoins

69
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,900
now I'll pay

70
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,820
A t-shirt and I got two postcards

71
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,260
I'm scanning the QR-code

72
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,140
I just hover over this

73
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,540
the amount is already entered, I only have to click "send"

74
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,260
I press "confirm"

75
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,140
Then I enter my PIN, which you're not allowed to see

76
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,479
and done!

77
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,660
so we just bought another postcard

78
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,600
as you can see here

79
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,420
and the cool thing is, this is paid with Bitcoin

80
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
they handle this

81
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,460
we got to know that there, I just put that here

82
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,979
done

83
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,140
We're here in Czech Republics biggest electronic retail company "Alza"

84
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,420
and now we can pay with Bitcoin

85
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,740
that's why we bought some batteries and now do the payment

86
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
so, I just confirm that

87
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,220
and the transaction is done

88
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,920
as you can see, it's done

89
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,640
"Alright you got a paper here, what's that for?"

90
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,399
"With this paper we can take our batteries we just paid with Bitcoin"

91
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,640
That's the batteries we just bought with Bitcoin

92
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,120
Unfortunately the transaction took quite some time

93
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,160
from that we can see that we urgently need a solution for the block size debate

94
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,419
but in the future they will also add Litecoin and Ethereum to their payment options

95
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,399
"Prague seems insignificant, but it's THE place for Bitcoin enthusiasts"

96
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,200
"We will probably hear more about Prague in the future"

97
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,500
"Our next destination will be the 'Bitcoinstad' Anhem in the Netherlands"
