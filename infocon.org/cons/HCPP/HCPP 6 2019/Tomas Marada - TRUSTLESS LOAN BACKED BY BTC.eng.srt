3
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:32,689
hello everyone good late afternoon thank

4
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,580
you for staying with us and not jumping

5
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:39,710
on the plane and or going to work

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:42,290
tomorrow so this talk is about

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,080
decentralized finance by Tomas Merida

8
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,570
and what is really interesting about

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:52,580
Tomas he's is that he's a mathematician

10
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:56,870
so he has a very interesting way of

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:01:02,839
looking at crypto sphere and derivatives

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:05,630
and what I learned from tomash while

13
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:09,740
working with him on some projects is

14
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:11,869
that these derivatives they can be

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,720
really nice building blocks and you can

16
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:17,630
use one derivative to build the others

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,110
and so on so it's very nice if you like

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,119
to play with Lego it's kind of the same

19
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,620
approach you can take pieces and put

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,680
them together and build something else

21
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:30,259
so this is one of the things that Tomas

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,140
will talk about I also like that he's

23
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:37,610
talking about it on Bitcoin because a

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:40,280
lot of decentralized finance is on top

25
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:49,369
of other projects at a coin so so please

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:55,520
welcome too much Merida thank you I will

27
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:59,420
try to or in on a website I announced

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,250
that I will talk about loan and if it's

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,399
possible to build a trust last loan on

30
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:09,110
top of Bitcoin yesterday evening after

31
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:12,020
many discussions here I changed topic of

32
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,840
the talk make it a little bit more

33
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,590
general on the centralized finance but

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,790
the loan will be included so don't worry

35
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:24,710
first I would like to talk about why

36
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,720
financial products such as derivatives

37
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:31,310
and decentralized finance are good for

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,590
Bitcoin because I see many people in the

39
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:38,650
community

40
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:43,340
they tend to think about derivatives as

41
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:47,060
raw as something which is toxic and not

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,890
very good for for Bitcoin and I would

43
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,400
like to change it because good

44
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,829
derivatives are good as good money are

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,560
good and bad there but it's are bad but

46
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:06,440
they shouldn't be thrown in in one

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:10,519
basket money and that they are almost in

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:14,840
separated classical economy thing about

49
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:18,700
that that money came up from need to

50
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,860
barter anthropologists on the other way

51
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,298
especially this in this book from David

52
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:29,959
Gruber who is behind Occupy Wall Street

53
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:33,980
argues that barter was probably not the

54
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:38,690
way how people before money interacted

55
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:42,518
between each other but they much more

56
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:47,090
likely had debt against each other and

57
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:50,269
he argues that money was a construct how

58
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:58,239
to have some unit of account in which

59
00:03:50,269 --> 00:04:02,630
you can subtract debt against each other

60
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:06,850
so I highly recommend this book and as

61
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:12,108
soon as as you have debt and money and

62
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:14,650
market you you have some risks you have

63
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:18,440
risk that the price will go up or down

64
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:22,840
interest will go up and down and you

65
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:30,260
have natural need to hedge this risk and

66
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:34,489
as people and the economy in old age goo

67
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:37,330
they they came up with different ways

68
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:41,950
how to hedge against these risks and

69
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:46,500
they came up with derivatives derivative

70
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:50,909
has primary need as an insurance

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:54,150
and some risk and secondary use as a

72
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,130
trading instrument and many times people

73
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,000
think about derivatives only in in

74
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:02,219
trading context but without the primary

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,490
need and there would be no derivatives

76
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:13,230
at all and I believe that with Bitcoin

77
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:16,110
we have similar similar needs and market

78
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,600
participants in Bitcoin and companies in

79
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:23,610
Bitcoin have same needs and they need to

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,790
hedge out risks and they need to if they

81
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:31,380
have ways how to hedge it out they can

82
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:35,780
plan more more reliably their business

83
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:41,219
cash flow and so on and traders which

84
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:46,950
sometimes are thought of as parasites I

85
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:49,470
think they bring liquidity and the the

86
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,770
good liquidity is essential for the

87
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,229
primary primary needs of their bodies

88
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,770
because then if someone wants to ensure

89
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:00,450
he has to provide how to do it where

90
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:07,919
there is no liquidity this insurance

91
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:12,080
it's much more expensive how many of you

92
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,080
know what is it feature and how it works

93
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:21,060
okay most of them most of you super just

94
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,060
very quickly it's an agreement between

95
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:28,800
two parties

96
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:31,680
which seek to get an exposure to to do

97
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,820
asset without actually buying the asset

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,130
and they open

99
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:42,599
position at a nominal value here in this

100
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:46,170
example it's $10,000 and they don't need

101
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:51,210
to have $10,000 they just need to put

102
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:53,970
somewhere on margin which covers which

103
00:06:51,210 --> 00:07:01,799
has to cover the intermediate price

104
00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:06,000
action and on the same side on similar

105
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:12,660
on the other side short part of the of

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,570
the future derivatives are great or the

107
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:20,610
more different derivatives the more

108
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:24,330
instruments how you can trade the asset

109
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,330
or or gain gain exposure it leads to

110
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:30,810
more efficient price discovery if you

111
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:33,900
have only spot market you and you have

112
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,420
opinion that bitcoin is undervalued you

113
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,390
can express it only in one way that you

114
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:42,150
go wrong you buy the spot and maybe sell

115
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:45,210
it later as soon as you get to the price

116
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:48,030
where you think it's Potter or

117
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,799
overvalued but as soon as you have many

118
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,099
different derivatives you can build

119
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:57,570
different exposures and for example in

120
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:01,260
the in this one you think that the price

121
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:04,169
will will be somewhere around B and C

122
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:08,580
and you are here in profit here you are

123
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:12,120
losing similar here and here and more

124
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,580
traders can express their opinions it

125
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,490
leads to more efficient price discovery

126
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:26,690
so Bitcoin financialization leads to

127
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:30,500
more efficient market current currently

128
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:34,710
financialization of Bitcoin is already

129
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:38,839
well in progress with the traction

130
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:43,680
especially in centralized solutions and

131
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,820
if you want to trade the asset you need

132
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,699
to have an exchange

133
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:54,280
you need to have why how to

134
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:59,260
swap between Bitcoin and Fiat dollars

135
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:02,380
you have to have landing where you can

136
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:08,560
borrow either fat or Bitcoin Bitcoin

137
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:12,900
mainly for shorting and with with more

138
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:18,000
developed market you you find a need for

139
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:22,000
derivatives as well right now most of

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,510
exchanges derivative exchanges are

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,550
unregulated CME which is regulated has

142
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:32,950
very low volumes but they are growing

143
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:38,500
and I think that in the last few months

144
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:44,050
they get over over the spot markets and

145
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:50,350
traded volume what what we have what we

146
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:53,589
see on I am yttrium is well there are no

147
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:57,280
no not much depth which have any

148
00:09:53,590 --> 00:10:00,210
attraction and direction ABB's depths

149
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,819
which with some traction right now are

150
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:07,770
mainly in define decentralized finance

151
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:12,030
because with centralized solution you

152
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:15,760
usually have counterparty risk you are

153
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:21,310
giving up privacy with kyc procedures

154
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:27,010
and the centralized solutions right now

155
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:32,079
are being built mostly only on atrium so

156
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:35,710
first you need to hold dollars somehow

157
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,690
so they came up with stable coins most

158
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:42,400
of them are centralized probably the

159
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:46,540
only exception is dye from maker dow

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:49,660
which is decentralized and it's backed

161
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:53,880
by ether but they seek how to extend it

162
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:58,270
to other asset specially to bitcoin

163
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:00,090
recently there are two stable coins

164
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,850
which which

165
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:09,420
tries to port bitcoins value to

166
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:17,720
aetherium and allow well Bitcoin value

167
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:20,760
in in d5 projects on aetherium you have

168
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:24,030
exchanges such a finance decentralized

169
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:29,670
exchange Yunus hope you solve this

170
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:33,959
really simple smart contract they all

171
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:38,640
have Bitcoin stable coins units of and

172
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:41,310
Finance decks that they are built on

173
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,270
atrium smart contracts and many many

174
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:47,459
holders do not want to take their

175
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,860
Bitcoin the majority of their Bitcoin or

176
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:55,050
big part of their bitcoins and to risk

177
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:58,590
it on a tea room or even centralized

178
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:12,900
stabler coins between stable coins on

179
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:15,360
aetherium so next to in lending maker

180
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:19,230
Dow is a smart contract where you can

181
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,870
lock eater right now either later they

182
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:25,770
seek to add Bitcoin and other real world

183
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:30,960
assets as well and create stable Cohen

184
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:34,490
die it has I believe about slightly less

185
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,290
than 100 million dollars value locked in

186
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:41,040
compound has great traction

187
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:45,719
it has about 150 million value locked in

188
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,150
and and growing the disadvantage of

189
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,720
these lending solutions is that you have

190
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:58,319
to put in collateral with much higher

191
00:12:51,720 --> 00:13:00,740
value then is your loan and so if you

192
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,700
want to take 1 million

193
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:09,750
one-way $20,000 loan you have to walk

194
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,710
probably at least thirty thousand value

195
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:17,060
of

196
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:20,750
here either or compound allows stay

197
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:24,880
Bitcoin stable coin as well and there

198
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:28,970
are some some smart contracts which

199
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:36,100
leads which tries to allow derivatives

200
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:38,660
as well and I will try on next slide

201
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:42,590
explain how this is completely

202
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:45,469
unnecessary and we can build it all on

203
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:52,630
top of Bitcoin without need for smart

204
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:56,720
contracts just the we need just one

205
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:59,810
important thing and that is future by

206
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,880
combination of spot Bitcoin and future

207
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:09,199
we can replicate all these things on the

208
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,230
previous slide first if we want to have

209
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:17,150
a stable coin on top of Bitcoin

210
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:22,370
we just need to combine one here I have

211
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:25,490
one Bitcoin which is my my I can have it

212
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:29,650
on on a margin on exchange or in my

213
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:33,290
wallet and I open a short position in

214
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:37,670
future and the combination of the short

215
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:40,839
position in future and holding of one

216
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:44,780
Bitcoin will always lead to value

217
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:47,000
$10,000 regardless of price of Bitcoin

218
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,670
the Bitcoin can can go up or down

219
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,790
I still have 10,000 if Bitcoin goes up

220
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:57,530
my Bitcoin is depreciating but I'm

221
00:14:52,790 --> 00:15:02,000
losing on the short and vice versa so

222
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:05,930
this is why how to hold dollar value and

223
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,770
potentially any other asset on top of

224
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:12,439
Bitcoin if I want to exchange it to

225
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:19,100
Bitcoin get out I just closed the

226
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:22,209
position that's very helpful for anyone

227
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:25,120
who accept bitcoins and doesn't want to

228
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:32,660
be exposed to the volatile

229
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:38,810
such minors ATM providers ecommerce

230
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:46,579
accepting bitcoins or riders though it's

231
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:48,949
it's mmm well yeah traders now I'm

232
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:55,029
getting to the loan which which I

233
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:59,439
promised I two years ago I started

234
00:15:55,029 --> 00:16:04,550
thinking about my own neat and and other

235
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:06,740
my friends hollers that they have they

236
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,889
have gone all into Bitcoin they believe

237
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:15,290
in in appreciation to future that don't

238
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:18,610
have any other big source of income and

239
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:21,740
they want to finance some consumption or

240
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,230
would like to invest more money more

241
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:31,699
capital and bitcoin but don't have any

242
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:37,160
and the only way how to do it right now

243
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:42,290
or not only by the main is to take a

244
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:44,750
loan let's say I assume an example where

245
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:48,740
I have one Bitcoin at ten thousand

246
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:52,639
dollars and I need to buy thousand

247
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:59,389
dollar TV I can either sell one tenth of

248
00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:03,429
Bitcoin and be left with 0.9 or I borrow

249
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:11,829
thousand or four in collateralized loan

250
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:17,750
and I am left with one Bitcoin - debt of

251
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:21,799
$1,000 it's it's same net wealth III my

252
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:23,869
net worth is $9,000 but my dynamics with

253
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:31,480
which it will change is different in

254
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:34,560
both cases I can replicate this loan

255
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:38,130
using future because

256
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:41,730
the need that I don't want to sell my

257
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:44,370
bitcoins is that I want to keep exposure

258
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:51,200
I want to keep the exposure to whole

259
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:53,689
Bitcoin not just 0.9 so it's very simply

260
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,940
very simply can be replicated by

261
00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:04,850
actually spending that 0.1 Bitcoin and

262
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:09,180
opening a long position and future at

263
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:12,719
$100,000 in this way I kept exposure to

264
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:21,360
whole Bitcoin though I have only net

265
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:26,880
wealth $9,000 and actually here if

266
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:29,610
someone has a short position here I am

267
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:35,280
that that's my that's my one Bitcoin

268
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:39,719
I opened while I spent one tenth of it

269
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:43,020
I opened long position in future here is

270
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:49,020
my counterpart a and the counterparty is

271
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:53,210
having completely complete position with

272
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:59,100
their 0.1 BTC so they basically locked

273
00:18:53,210 --> 00:19:02,850
$1,000 as I explained before and using

274
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:06,060
these futures they are borrowing me or

275
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,699
lending me the liquidity so this guy who

276
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:15,770
is short and long Bitcoin and short

277
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:15,770
future is borrowing me $1,000

278
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:25,700
he should have been table

279
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:37,330
during that double cabinet from your

280
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,330
weight

281
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,670
Oh

282
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:13,570
mm-hmm

283
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:30,310
here I have three different strategies

284
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:33,520
what I can do if I start with one

285
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:37,919
Bitcoin at $10,000 and I want to buy a

286
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:41,680
TV for $1,000 I can either spend 1/10

287
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,680
and I will be left with nine thousand

288
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:49,930
dollars net wealth or I can borrow it

289
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:53,890
with some centralized solution or I can

290
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:59,440
spend one tenth of Bitcoin and open long

291
00:20:53,890 --> 00:21:02,320
position in futures in all strategies I

292
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:07,210
have same same outcome if Bitcoin goes

293
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:11,590
to twenty thousand dollars here my net

294
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:14,290
wealth doubled to 18 thousand dollars in

295
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:16,540
these two strategies I have 19 thousand

296
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:21,159
dollars because I didn't spend my

297
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:24,850
Bitcoin or here I did buy I compensated

298
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,670
for it by opening long position here

299
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:32,260
it's 20 thousand - thousand dollar depth

300
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:36,130
and here it's 18 thousand plus 1000

301
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:38,650
profit from the long position in the

302
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,350
last column there is a situation with

303
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:45,790
Bitcoin going down to five thousand

304
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:48,330
where I would be best if I spend my

305
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:51,460
Bitcoin and didn't take a lot because if

306
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:56,860
I'm taking a loan I'm basically

307
00:21:51,460 --> 00:22:01,840
leveraging myself a little bit and both

308
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:04,090
wise I'm getting more I'm going gaining

309
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:09,629
more profit if it if Bitcoin goes down

310
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,629
and I'm losing more if Bitcoin goes down

311
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:26,210
Bitcoin not become but futures in

312
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:30,529
general tend to trade at a little bit

313
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:34,580
different price than spot if there is a

314
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:38,750
lot of people who want to go long they

315
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:43,939
have to pay something extra to be able

316
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:47,779
to go long to short side so in a bull

317
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:51,379
market the future price tends to be

318
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:55,279
above the spot market and in bear market

319
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:58,428
when there is more sellers the future

320
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:02,539
price tend to be below and that is

321
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:05,720
implicitly an interest rate in this

322
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:09,529
replication strategies so anywhere when

323
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,990
where I mentioned that you go long and

324
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:15,590
bull market you will have to pay for it

325
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:21,889
some interest rate covered in this

326
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:27,049
market dynamics if you get short you are

327
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:31,879
paid so in this stable coin setup where

328
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:37,059
you buy spot and open short position you

329
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:40,039
have very well-funded interest rate in

330
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:48,139
last bull market you could get about

331
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:50,539
thirty percent interest rate VI the

332
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:54,620
difference between these two approaches

333
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:58,179
either normal loan and future

334
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:02,268
replication by future is mainly in

335
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:05,539
capital efficiency because in loan you

336
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:09,679
have to put down collateral which is

337
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:13,220
manifold higher than the nominal value

338
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,129
of the loan and in future you have to

339
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:21,370
put just margin which might be about 20

340
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:25,668
to 40 percent so your capital at risk

341
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:29,799
with counterparty is much smaller

342
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:32,470
you can open bigger positions but

343
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:36,639
you might trigger capital gains that's

344
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:41,549
the disadvantage because loan as text

345
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:52,119
Metro think what future you might get

346
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:58,860
capital gains so wait defy I'm arguing

347
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:58,860
that all this defy can be built on BTC

348
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:06,190
only with with correct combination of

349
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:10,239
spots stable coins combination of spot

350
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:14,109
and short short position in future if

351
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:16,929
you want to exchange get from dollars to

352
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:22,658
Bitcoin you just close the position or

353
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:25,210
open the position landing it's its spot

354
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:32,590
and long position and if you want to

355
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:40,230
trade you can you can just just go for

356
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:45,340
it the only disadvantage of this is the

357
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:50,049
exchange exchange itself and if you go

358
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:54,459
for current exchanges you have to go

359
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:56,529
either to regulate it exchanges worried

360
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,509
where I don't expect so much

361
00:25:56,529 --> 00:26:01,659
counterparty risk but I am risking my

362
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:04,720
privacy or to go to unregulated

363
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:07,179
exchanges where I'm exposed to

364
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,220
counterparty risk the exchange can be

365
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:12,059
hacked it's not insured

366
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:17,049
if it goes bust I will not get anything

367
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:20,859
so I think we should build a

368
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:24,399
decentralized future because out of this

369
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:30,789
future we can build many different

370
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:35,649
products on top of it and simple future

371
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:39,970
as a peer-to-peer contract might be only

372
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:41,979
a contract between two people the

373
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,779
simplest possible is just between two

374
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:49,109
friends who trust each other

375
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:51,940
and they decide that one has for example

376
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:56,799
dollar liquidity and and seeks some

377
00:26:51,940 --> 00:27:00,879
interest some profit and the other one

378
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:06,279
wants to bet on the coming bull market

379
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:09,389
so they agree that they open future

380
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:17,759
position between each other one goes

381
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:21,279
short future and buy the spot so if if

382
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:24,639
the nominal value is $10,000

383
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:28,359
this guy will buy one Bitcoin for

384
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:33,008
$10,000 and open short position the

385
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:35,379
other guy well just agreed that he will

386
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:39,099
take long position and pays for it an

387
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:42,399
interest rate I think that 15 to 20

388
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:45,609
percent is completely reasonable and

389
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:49,059
they regularly settle in a way that the

390
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:53,019
first guy who wants the interest rate

391
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:56,289
has always $10,000 plus the interest

392
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:58,479
rate if Bitcoin goes up his bitcoins

393
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:58,929
which he bought in the beginning at the

394
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:03,820
spot

395
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:05,979
are slowly moving to the counterparty if

396
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:09,450
Bitcoin goes down it goes the other

397
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:15,549
direction if they don't trust each other

398
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:19,419
they might at they might get down some

399
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:22,109
margin and to multi-sig 2 or 3 with an

400
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:30,029
arbiter which they choose and they trust

401
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:31,899
and in case of dispute this arbiter can

402
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:37,450
kind of resolve them

403
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:41,908
and I'm working together with few people

404
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:44,909
here on on a concept how to build

405
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:44,909
decentralized

406
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:55,710
future with a network effect on top of

407
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:58,590
unchain and lightning and which shared

408
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:01,950
liquidity and if you are interested

409
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:07,760
definitely stay for next talk of Patrick

410
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:07,760
J Gordon well who will talk about this

411
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:24,300
and it's probably all from me okay thank

412
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:32,090
you very much do we have questions from

413
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:37,740
the audience so maybe I will share my

414
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:43,040
experience what how I can how I realized

415
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:48,530
that I can use these Bitcoin futures so

416
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:54,570
I realized that I can actually do what

417
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:57,480
Tamar said with having dollar balance on

418
00:29:54,570 --> 00:30:01,050
my bank account exactly by this strategy

419
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:04,890
so if you have a I don't know thousand

420
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:06,659
dollars you can and you don't want to be

421
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,490
expose you want to keep it in dollars

422
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,990
you don't want to be exposed to crazy

423
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,540
price movements because you've had

424
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,640
enough and and so on you just want to

425
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:19,560
keep your thousand dollars you can put

426
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:22,980
it in the bank and pay fees and negative

427
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:25,020
interest rate or zero interest rates to

428
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,270
the bank so you wouldn't do anything

429
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:30,930
it's just you know you give someone your

430
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:33,840
money and it sits there and I realized

431
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:37,590
as a Bitcoin person that what I can do

432
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,679
is I can take these thousand dollars by

433
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:45,179
Bitcoin worth of thousand dollars so so

434
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:47,880
I get the spot position in Bitcoin and

435
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:50,040
then I go to beat Max and I short

436
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,590
thousand dollars on

437
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,870
on a Bitcoin future I still have

438
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:57,000
thousand dollars it's in Bitcoin and I

439
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,149
get paid an interest rate which is

440
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,790
positive so this is one of the use cases

441
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:07,710
and the only problem with this approach

442
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:11,850
is what if it makes gets hacked or what

443
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:15,810
if something happens to to my money but

444
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:18,120
for me just realizing that I can do it

445
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:20,639
do this means that I can have a much

446
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,850
better bank account because I still keep

447
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,910
my thousand dollars I don't I don't need

448
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:29,370
to worry about exchange rates and wake

449
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:33,210
up every morning and see if it's red or

450
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,909
green I can I can have the stability and

451
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:40,770
get paid some money in order to do this

452
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:43,710
so so this came out of discussions with

453
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:46,370
Tomas and Patrick and it's a really

454
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:50,220
useful thing because when you talk to

455
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:51,899
people about Bitcoin they say oh I don't

456
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,270
have the stomach for the for the

457
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,690
volatility therefore I cannot use it and

458
00:31:54,270 --> 00:32:02,340
it's not true but you need to kind of

459
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:06,440
dig a little bit deeper and and look for

460
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:08,879
solutions so okay now an actual question

461
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,720
thanks and thanks for the presentation

462
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,180
actually um can if we use this over here

463
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,040
in Ronnie police for pricing the goods

464
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,740
which are there on the table like you

465
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,530
want the Vitis on things and it it's

466
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,940
dominated as 150 Czech crowns why did so

467
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,760
many didn't hundred fifty Czech crowns

468
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,920
why it's not normally in Satoshi's can

469
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,010
we use it well I asked there and the

470
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,810
answer's up because of the volatility

471
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:38,790
because of the Bitcoin mortality so we

472
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:42,849
could use this actually to to doubt if

473
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:47,359
they accept Bitcoin catch it in two

474
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:50,840
into Czech crowns or dollars but they

475
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,939
would have to change the amount of

476
00:32:50,840 --> 00:33:02,090
bitcoins paid for it like everyday

477
00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:03,710
almost yeah hello thanks for a talk can

478
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,809
you provide a little bit more of

479
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,909
technical details how do you see it

480
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:10,340
implemented especially in decentralized

481
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:14,690
version because you have mentioned that

482
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:17,869
we can Alice and Bob can go 203

483
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:20,450
multi-sig with an arbiter but then I

484
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:26,599
guess arbiter becomes the central point

485
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:30,070
of further and yeah in a situation like

486
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:36,009
maker Dow you would need price Oracle's

487
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:39,529
etc etc thanks but I would recommend

488
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:43,279
talk of Patrick because I will be all

489
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:45,229
about that okay okay thank you do you

490
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,409
have a github or something that I can

491
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:47,409
follow

492
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:55,089
we are very in a conceptual phase we

493
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:59,570
want to publish extended white paper

494
00:33:55,089 --> 00:34:01,269
soon and push rather the movement we

495
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:04,070
don't want to build it only ourselves

496
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:07,729
would be helpful if there will be more

497
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:10,250
companies trying to build it okay but

498
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:12,020
there there is a description on how to

499
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,668
do it on top of Lightning Network is

500
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,599
well not only multi six so there is a

501
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:17,629
big paper due

502
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:22,460
yes so there's a paper but Patrick will

503
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:25,788
talk about it but what I what I really

504
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:28,569
like is like the low tech version which

505
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:31,369
we used in peril police in Bratislava of

506
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:34,099
collateralized loan which you can really

507
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:38,119
do with people physically so you say

508
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:40,909
okay please lend me thousand euros

509
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:43,970
here's the collateral and we can make

510
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:46,309
really a low tech paper contract and and

511
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:48,828
do it within the community so like that

512
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:52,250
the step zero is actually not to write

513
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:54,049
any software but to really do it

514
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,540
in the community and and that works and

515
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:59,150
we have tried it and it's very very

516
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:02,569
useful way how to how to finance stuff

517
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:05,569
and these steps are a kind of

518
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:09,890
technological evolution that will create

519
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:11,540
more liquid market I guess any thanks so

520
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:15,230
exam I'm very excited personally about

521
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:17,569
the project of and the possibilities of

522
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:21,140
how to sort of spread it you know spread

523
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:23,599
this type of new financing but as so far

524
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,430
we have examples with 1000 euros for

525
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,390
example it's great for an interpersonal

526
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:31,160
basis but I'm wondering if you guys have

527
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:33,140
some more information perhaps in the

528
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,540
subsequent talk that we could address

529
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:39,170
how this can be scaled up perhaps one or

530
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:41,450
more larger b2b scale where perhaps we

531
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,790
can integrate the participation of

532
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:46,250
minors for example who are natural

533
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:48,470
clients for this product and other you

534
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:51,500
know large scale you know Bitcoin

535
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:55,640
centric people and corporation or

536
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:59,180
cooperatives and perhaps also link this

537
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:02,990
up in terms of how to hedge sequestered

538
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:04,848
coins or under your structure how to

539
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:07,308
link them with perhaps existing

540
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:12,520
exchanges even you know you mentioned

541
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:15,760
very Bert or others to smooth out the

542
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:18,530
the hedging requirements within those

543
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,530
just something to consider thanks that's

544
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:26,059
thank you thank you about scaling that

545
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:28,819
work we'll definitely talk about netting

546
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:31,309
out the positions and and Quattro needed

547
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:35,079
for the positions we don't have the

548
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:35,079
solution for that not yet

549
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:51,969
I understand the need would be very

550
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:53,619
helpful it's for in future hi thank you

551
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:56,169
for for your talk

552
00:36:53,619 --> 00:37:00,999
I have a question about the interest

553
00:36:56,169 --> 00:37:03,808
rate on Bitcoin how is this what is the

554
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:08,788
fair interest rates the same Bitcoin and

555
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:12,039
since the future price I guess is really

556
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:15,099
sensitive to interest rate do you

557
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:17,769
believe that in there will be a lot of

558
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:22,989
arbitrary support unit in this market if

559
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:29,319
you I mean how efficient can be the

560
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:33,640
future so the future markets with with

561
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:34,779
not with a not stable interest rates so

562
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,169
the first question is how do you

563
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:40,569
calculate the interest rate what is the

564
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:43,929
fair interest rate for BTC for Bitcoin

565
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:46,959
because III mean we use the with the

566
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:49,929
so-called risk-free interest rate in

567
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:55,058
future contract for stocks and but there

568
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:57,099
is no free three thank you I would

569
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:58,719
question if there is even a risk

570
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:05,640
interest rate the international finance

571
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:09,729
but yeah here I wanted to show how

572
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,308
futures market and basically trading is

573
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:16,419
interconnected with lending that it can

574
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:24,159
be replicated with each other so the in

575
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:26,558
premium on future derivatives is very

576
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:29,199
closely connected with interest rates in

577
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:31,719
lending they influence each other were

578
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:34,359
heavily so if the market is very bullish

579
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:37,419
and seeking for any in dollars you can

580
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:44,140
lend to buy more Bitcoin the interest

581
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:45,848
rates will go up and vice versa if I

582
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:49,419
might just follow up on that point so I

583
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:51,350
think it's very very valid I've observed

584
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:55,009
I haven't been a personal use

585
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:58,009
but you noted opera services like block

586
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:59,840
by and Nexo and my understanding from

587
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:02,360
what I've heard is that they pay a

588
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,910
stable interest rate in return for the

589
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,010
coins that you lock up I which equates

590
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:09,500
to approximately 6% per annum

591
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,760
on average so I don't know if we you

592
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,830
know maybe you might want to look at

593
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,320
that as a starting point and then see

594
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:17,150
how that balances out with other market

595
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,890
rates or services and actually I have a

596
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,290
question on that if anybody knows the

597
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,200
answers how those companies block fire

598
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,730
operate their you know how they actually

599
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,160
serve to guarantee that sort of right I

600
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:31,700
don't know but something to look into

601
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,700
thanks guys well I know that they lock

602
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:37,339
the interest rate for a month you cannot

603
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:40,660
lock it for longer than one month though

604
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:45,050
they don't change it regularly and they

605
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:49,210
borrowed assets to counter parties which

606
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:53,510
they personally believe for shorting and

607
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:55,280
trading and for for capital requirements

608
00:39:53,510 --> 00:40:08,630
for operation like for exchanges and so

609
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:12,110
on are there any other questions okay so

610
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:14,710
if there is no other question I have one

611
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:19,120
one more thing it's a work in progress

612
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:19,120
but I would like to share it with you

613
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:28,310
well I believe that we are before

614
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:32,510
another bull market and I would like to

615
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:34,430
bet on it but I'm not a trader and I

616
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:38,710
don't want to time market and be

617
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:41,629
stressed about I like simple things like

618
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:46,220
dollar cost averaging strategy which is

619
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:51,200
I think the best possible strategy how

620
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:53,899
to buy in bitcoins so you bi-weekly or

621
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,779
monthly sum regular amount and you don't

622
00:40:53,900 --> 00:41:01,880
care about what price is doing I was

623
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:05,430
thinking if this sort of

624
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:10,289
simple dumb strategy can be ported to

625
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:13,220
futures and profit on oncoming bull

626
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:16,920
market so basically just betting that

627
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:19,919
there is bull market coming it will play

628
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,109
out in the next two years and I don't

629
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:28,230
want to time the market but I want to

630
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:30,750
profit off from it and so okay I went

631
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:34,260
from the door cost averaging Thursday

632
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:38,490
she I started and I back tested it on

633
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:42,210
last last bull market which doesn't mean

634
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:45,029
anything but it's well it's indication

635
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:49,920
nothing more and I'm working on some

636
00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:56,880
analysis of it I start six months before

637
00:41:49,920 --> 00:42:02,670
housing and I set some given percentage

638
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:07,619
of my capital which I every week open or

639
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:10,259
add to my position in futures and I keep

640
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:12,690
doing it regardless of what is going on

641
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:17,039
if my capital is going up I keep

642
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:19,559
increasing there are few more nuances

643
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:24,900
but I'm not timing the market

644
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:29,789
I'm just regularly adding if I did it in

645
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:35,430
last bull market and I decided to add

646
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:38,190
one percent weekly which means that even

647
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:44,970
if nothing happened for two years I

648
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:50,460
would only build leverage to I would end

649
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:54,049
up and and I started six months before

650
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:59,450
having and quit 18 months after howling

651
00:42:54,049 --> 00:43:04,549
which was month 1 month after

652
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:07,779
the top I'm not trying to get the top I

653
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:12,859
was in the calculations getting out at

654
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:18,950
$12,000 if I took one percent I would

655
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:22,788
end up with 2.2 fold more bitcoins than

656
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:29,058
I started with and at any point I was my

657
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:33,250
leverage was below 1.5 the highest

658
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:36,769
possible weekly increase would be 15%

659
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:38,779
where I would get to two at one point

660
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:42,669
after after one big correction I would

661
00:43:38,779 --> 00:43:45,769
get to leverage 14 which which is

662
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:48,260
probably way too risky but I still

663
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:51,709
wouldn't get liquidated and I would end

664
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:55,900
up with two hundred seventy four times

665
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,900
more bitcoins than I started with

666
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:05,509
if anyone is interested to write me an

667
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:08,899
email and as soon as I will or we will

668
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:16,430
get more results we want to publish it

669
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:16,980
and release it that's it okay thank you

670
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:21,899
very much

671
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,900
[Applause]

672
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,900
you
