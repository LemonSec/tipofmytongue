3
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:32,960
welcome to next lecture I would like to

4
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:43,100
warmly welcome our guest speaker dr.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:47,960
maxim Orlovsky exactly thank you yes you

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,640
understand well mr. arlovski is or dr.

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:56,000
Orlovsky sorry you have to keep the

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:59,810
academic habits is our speaker from

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,040
previous year and last year Maxim has

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:07,040
introduced us his research about

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:10,280
artificial intelligence and how to make

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,970
it independent on any auditorium

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,960
pressure I would say and this year

14
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:22,399
Maxime is gonna talk about following

15
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:25,160
topic which puts together other new

16
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:30,830
technologies and make some future vision

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:34,340
of how our potential digital amore amore

18
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:39,740
tablet amore immortality story could

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:47,320
seem like Maxim is long term researcher

20
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:50,110
and he established a company focusing at

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,619
decentralized technologies and

22
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:59,090
structures based in based in Switzerland

23
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:05,479
and the company is called Pandora core

24
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:09,140
and I would like to pass the word and

25
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:13,310
after after the talk you can ask

26
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:18,410
questions of course so thank you thank

27
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:21,709
you mr. Olaf today I would like to talk

28
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:24,470
about quite a complex topic it's complex

29
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,900
both from a technical and philosophical

30
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:30,109
perspective and it's very hard to

31
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,919
discuss such matters of not going into

32
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:37,790
some crazy science fiction or being

33
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,829
sound even a bit scammy because

34
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:44,090
today all those words digital

35
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:46,640
immortality and decentralization ico

36
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:51,140
blockchain their more and more often Li

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,409
used by people who try to raise some

38
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:58,399
money for something but my point here is

39
00:02:54,409 --> 00:03:01,790
not rather review the way we can achieve

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,720
the digital immortality but find how we

41
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:12,170
can avoid a big tribals on the road

42
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:16,700
forward to singularity Who am I well I

43
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:19,548
have multiple backgrounds the most the

44
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,069
regional one I'm neuroscientist being

45
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:25,989
doing a neuroscientific research for

46
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:29,119
many years but I'm also a hacker from

47
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:33,950
Wow much even earlier probably from a

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,530
school time and I used to even to wrote

49
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,388
some viruses and later I decided to go

50
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,849
into medicine because I was interested

51
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:43,879
in a way the neural system and the brain

52
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:47,750
works how it can be broken an efficient

53
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:50,690
way so I was also interested in machine

54
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,790
learning for that reason and just quite

55
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,760
a recently I became a Bitcoin or

56
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,828
understanding the value proposition that

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,209
Bitcoin provides as a censorship

58
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:04,459
resistant money so today I'm joining all

59
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,530
of those directions in the bruit

60
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,260
projects that we are doing at Pandora

61
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,989
core we basically saying that we are try

62
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,078
to scale the future and throughout the

63
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:21,349
presentation I will explain why I think

64
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:24,139
the scalability is needed today we see a

65
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:28,400
lot of progress in different areas of

66
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:31,159
technology and first of all a lot of

67
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,750
things happens in the field of the life

68
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:39,110
extension medical progress fighting not

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:42,199
the death itself yet but rather a

70
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,960
million of reasons why somebody can die

71
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,150
basically different aging diseases

72
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,200
different diseases of civilization one

73
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,650
by one is being fought and probably with

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,889
a

75
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,138
in genetics we will see the constant

76
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:59,240
increase of the life expectancy so there

77
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:03,979
is no big science fiction here it's

78
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,979
already happens and that's why people

79
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:08,479
saying that there is a potential

80
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,729
immortality when it's not that you are

81
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,620
not going to die it's well sorry

82
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:16,060
asymptotically and mortality it's not

83
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:19,070
that you are not going to die but rather

84
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,850
the medical progress will postpone your

85
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,130
death basically the ad infinitum in the

86
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:28,340
next 10 years we will find a way to

87
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,260
extend life for another 20 years in the

88
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,570
next 20 years we will find a way to

89
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:37,669
extend life for another 50 years and so

90
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:40,400
on and so forth so it's coming and it's

91
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,169
not only about extending the life but

92
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,169
it's also about extending and

93
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:47,539
intelligence you already heard a lot

94
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,479
probably about Europe brain computer

95
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:51,979
interfaces neck neuro computer

96
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:56,389
interfaces and implants I wouldn't be

97
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:59,539
talking about that today and with a

98
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:01,990
better methods of research we with a

99
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:04,880
functional magnetic resonance and

100
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,680
tractography we understand more we

101
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,159
understand more and more about how the

102
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,810
brain is actually functioning providing

103
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:14,120
a hope that at some point we will be

104
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,190
able to grasp where the actual

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,860
intelligence is coming from the

106
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:24,169
neuroscience neuro scientific background

107
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:26,900
and additionally to that we have a big

108
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:28,760
developments in computing like machine

109
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,750
learning technology quantum computing

110
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:35,419
applied to biochemical studies and

111
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:38,630
together that allows us to assemble the

112
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:41,448
data and generate extract the knowledge

113
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:44,150
from this data on genome on proteome

114
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:47,930
which is basically how we express all

115
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:50,150
our genes in proteins and connectome

116
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,599
which is how the brain neurons are

117
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,698
connected across the brain this gives us

118
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,159
a promise that at some point we will

119
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:01,400
understand most of the causes of

120
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:05,610
diseases and the death and mechanics of

121
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,679
this thinking process so event

122
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,409
surely that leads us to this idea of

123
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,479
immortality which is which starts with

124
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:15,840
asymptotic life extension that I just

125
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,860
explained when we are fighting against

126
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,609
aging and up to potential immortality

127
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,530
when we just don't have any causes of

128
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,629
the desk itself in terms of our

129
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,750
biological body it's still questionable

130
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:32,159
is it possible at all or not but there

131
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,139
is a lot of research and a lot of

132
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:39,360
finding goes into this direction and

133
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,789
extension of our intelligence promising

134
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,849
at some point to allow us to transfer

135
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:48,628
our personality identity intelligence

136
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:51,300
into some non biological substrates so

137
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:53,939
up to the non-biological immortality

138
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,629
where we can continue to live not as a

139
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:59,370
biological bodies so maybe it's a

140
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:01,740
science fiction but it's happening

141
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,979
billions of dollars are spent on that

142
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,289
and actually there is not a lot that

143
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,270
people sitting in this room can do we

144
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:13,620
don't have that amount of researchers to

145
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:16,440
drive investigation in the new jet in

146
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,289
the new therapy methods we don't have

147
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,229
access to billions of human genome data

148
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,029
which are required to run those

149
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:26,219
investigations we don't have access to

150
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:28,770
supercomputers to quantum computers

151
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:30,839
where basically have no resources to

152
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,838
proceed in this direction but we know

153
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:36,390
that humanity does that and basically we

154
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,060
probably can sit back and relax waiting

155
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:42,630
with our constant life expectance

156
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:46,589
extension happening well not really and

157
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,720
that's why what that is actually a topic

158
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:50,880
of my talk what is the problem there

159
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,000
because it looks so smooth and nice

160
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,730
today

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,730
but you can think that with these

162
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:03,860
developments people will become aware of

163
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:09,300
this idea of immortality or very long

164
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:12,690
very long life expectancy so if humans

165
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,689
fought wars for a promise of life after

166
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,029
the death can you imagine what will

167
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,449
happen for a promise of life without a

168
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:20,449
death

169
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:32,620
in order to move into the direction of

170
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,900
immortality and in terms if not even

171
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,860
immortality itself but the proper but

172
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:41,650
the progress itself we need a couple of

173
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,900
prerequisites and you all know them they

174
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:47,470
start with the ideas of free trade and

175
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,840
not forced exchange or information

176
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:53,410
disclosure by lower requirements our

177
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:57,130
regulations not a licensing and not a

178
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:00,069
different taxation on importing we need

179
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,890
free and open research instead of beer

180
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,370
ethics eco activism drug research and

181
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:10,000
use regulations and we need unbreakable

182
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:13,270
private ownership of the data basically

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,420
which requires privacy and we need to be

184
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,760
able to explicitly trade our own data

185
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,979
because it's not just about protection

186
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,220
of privacy it's also about you wouldn't

187
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,470
be able to discover new methods of gene

188
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,040
therapy without accessing billions of

189
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,630
genome data so you can't just prohibit

190
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,569
companies from collecting the personal

191
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,240
data you have to allow the trade for the

192
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,400
private data so people will be selling

193
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,420
their data earning something in reward

194
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,760
and this is done not in a way of today

195
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:50,800
we have with the GDP per our regulations

196
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:53,400
and the rest of them so I'm just trying

197
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,930
to explore this idea of what can happen

198
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,110
for the promise of life without the

199
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,569
death basically from the one side we

200
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,030
have this progress which I have just

201
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:06,490
have described and this progress

202
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,640
requires these different forms of free

203
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:12,970
markets and from the other people are

204
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,740
scared of the risks they're scared the

205
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,600
government scared of the risks because

206
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,330
basically they don't want people to live

207
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,750
longer it takes more for Setia social

208
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,610
care it takes more for welfare and it

209
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,990
creates actually a lot of problems and

210
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:31,750
there are all other risks there related

211
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,800
to gene to therapy so government usually

212
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,529
explore

213
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,199
exploit those risks to create a fears

214
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,420
and to put a basis to create and

215
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,370
regulations I will I was just covering

216
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,120
all those regulations that have already

217
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,640
happened

218
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,010
and basically what it leads it leads to

219
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,959
the problems with a future progress and

220
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:55,860
while we have all these requirements for

221
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,869
the progress we have actually a

222
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,320
prohibition for most of those things to

223
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:05,589
happen by licensing gdpr and the plenty

224
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,730
of other regulatory stuff why because

225
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:11,980
this is the matter of national security

226
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:13,810
you know this phrase access to the

227
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,870
knowledge and technologies to produce

228
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,790
the knowledge must be regulated it is

229
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,040
the opinion of the government because it

230
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:24,339
can create a threat to the national

231
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,180
security like atomic weapon because if

232
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:30,880
people will be promising to life live

233
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:34,529
without death they can be exploited to a

234
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:38,560
different reasons and different

235
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:42,250
different clerical things as government

236
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,140
says usage of knowledge must be limited

237
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,930
because of the social problems we can't

238
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:50,140
allow everybody to do whatever they want

239
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:53,529
and military force will be used to

240
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:56,380
enforce those above so it's not like

241
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:58,810
please don't do a research in these or

242
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,420
that direction it is it will be a

243
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,819
government it will be courts it will be

244
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,610
military forces applied to those who are

245
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,730
doing different stuff as today you you

246
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:12,130
know ready that even at smaller scale if

247
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,529
you do a medical research you will be

248
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:17,560
strictly regulated by be your ethics and

249
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:19,570
you will if you will try to avoid those

250
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,939
regulations probably your laboratory

251
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,520
will be destroyed not yet by the

252
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:28,270
governmental forces by a people who are

253
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:32,319
drivin by some crazy ideas of protecting

254
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:35,170
animal life or something like that so

255
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,770
this knowledge will become classified

256
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,779
and we we still have a progress in all

257
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,000
those areas one of the main reasons for

258
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:46,150
that is the internet it is a great

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,660
enabler and we are very happy that it

260
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,270
acts

261
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,520
this technology have gone into the wild

262
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,890
because it allows a lot most of our

263
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:58,210
knowledge exchange today international

264
00:13:53,890 --> 00:14:01,020
trade and unfortunately the internet

265
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:04,450
while being a great enabler provides no

266
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,520
intrinsic means of the privacy and

267
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,640
that's why we are getting harder and

268
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,010
harder push from their governments for

269
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,620
to sender it to limit to national

270
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:19,540
borders and they are quite successful in

271
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:22,480
doing that so the idea is that wherever

272
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:25,689
you will try to do something outside of

273
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,510
the government which can create a threat

274
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:31,000
to national security interests like

275
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,550
creating of advanced technology for life

276
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,120
extension or artificial intelligence or

277
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:40,180
whatever you will your actions will be

278
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,760
attributed to you and you will be

279
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,040
retribute it for those actions with a

280
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,640
force and you wouldn't be able to do

281
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,040
anything against that so that's the

282
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,110
thing that goes wrong with all that

283
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,660
progress is basically the progress

284
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,120
becomes a private property of the

285
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,819
government and even large corporations

286
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,770
they're still sort of kind of part of

287
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,920
the government itself because of

288
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:09,630
different ways the actual politics and

289
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,250
countries can control those corporations

290
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:15,340
there was a great talk

291
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,740
last year by smuggler he presented this

292
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:20,380
idea and definition of crypto UNAC ISM

293
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,200
and his point is that we need to break

294
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,439
this sequence from the egg to the

295
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,650
punishment from the public forces just

296
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,560
to make observation and attribution of

297
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:35,709
the actions impossible because of the

298
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,979
privacy technologies so we can basically

299
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:41,950
start fixing the internet adding privacy

300
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,230
into that and it is not not only a

301
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,270
privacy that is required we also require

302
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,400
an embedded economy that can't be

303
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,620
stopped by the regulation basically this

304
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,380
economy will require uncensored bill

305
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,450
money and we have Bitcoin but bitcoin is

306
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,700
not the part of the inch stack of the

307
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,240
Internet protocols themselves so it can

308
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,829
be separated still

309
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,259
we need to do that in a very

310
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:06,209
decentralized way which is really hard

311
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,490
because even internet thought to be

312
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:11,429
decentralized have a lot of centralized

313
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:14,850
parts like the domain name service

314
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:16,860
structure and how we can fix the

315
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,660
internet there are different ways and

316
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,449
different ideas I will start probably

317
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:26,969
with the wrong one this magical unicorns

318
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:31,949
the problem with that the ideas are good

319
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:35,730
but there is no real research and rather

320
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:37,649
the the rather than research just young

321
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,079
people create some strange stuff which

322
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:42,360
is constantly broken and at the end of

323
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,269
the day it leads to more governance than

324
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,819
less basically all these projects for

325
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:51,689
putting down governance or whatever

326
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:55,498
basically defines in you tyranny of my

327
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:57,449
or majority of people who will vote for

328
00:16:55,499 --> 00:17:00,269
something and unfortunately I don't have

329
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:03,059
today a time to cover that topic but in

330
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:05,490
fact the democracy itself is contrary to

331
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:08,459
capitalism and it's contrary to freedom

332
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:11,429
because basically in democracy and

333
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,669
majority abled is able to force you to

334
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:17,069
do something or not to do something so

335
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:19,289
this all democratic unicorn ideas they

336
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,408
are really magical fortunately they do

337
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,398
not work there is a lot of reasons why

338
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:27,240
they do not work

339
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:29,428
starting from well I wouldn't spend time

340
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,289
on that there is mystical tack they are

341
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:34,409
saying about charring shots for serenity

342
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:36,779
helium plasma whatever shouting problem

343
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:38,909
being researched and tried to solve by

344
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,549
computer science in a computer scientist

345
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:44,970
for 20 years and now some students are

346
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:48,690
aiming to solve it with a plenty of

347
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,179
others stuff all together basically the

348
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,710
truth is that it's just high school

349
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:56,429
science project plus billion dollar

350
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:59,899
marketing and we can not be afraid of

351
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:05,250
that because it's not going to happen

352
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:06,870
what is why it all started this ideas of

353
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,510
doing a theorem because people were

354
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:12,270
saying we can't program Bitcoin due to

355
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,620
its limited functionality so we have to

356
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:17,310
invent something you

357
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:20,850
is that really true well let's look into

358
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:22,770
what actually Bitcoin does Bitcoin is a

359
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,860
form of digital programmable hard money

360
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:28,080
which we all know be built of layers the

361
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,320
first one is a blockchain Bitcoin

362
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,270
blockchain not arbitrary one which

363
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,030
serves the purpose of store of value and

364
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,550
the second one is a lightning Network

365
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,920
which is means which provides means of

366
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,020
payment these to the other renders

367
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,110
Bitcoin as a unit of accounting and

368
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,540
three these three poor properties digit

369
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,870
store value means of payment and unit of

370
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:54,840
accounting makes Bitcoin a real digital

371
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,810
programmable money but there is more to

372
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,389
Bitcoin than just money first of all the

373
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:02,879
Bitcoin blockchain layer can be used as

374
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:06,260
economically secure trustless time

375
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:10,260
stamping and proof of application system

376
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:12,660
second lightning network can be utilized

377
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:16,020
in a way it already provides a onion

378
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,630
message routing that we can do and build

379
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,600
economically incentivized private

380
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:24,510
messaging systems completely private and

381
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,490
protected with money being paid for

382
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,700
message delivery to lightning network

383
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:34,050
nodes and just that's just a few

384
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:36,510
examples of how of why we can talk about

385
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:40,320
bitcoin protocol and lightning network

386
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:44,190
protocols not just as a money or payment

387
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,980
system but as about but as of new type

388
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:51,750
of technological stack that can be

389
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:54,780
compared to tcp/ip but unlikely to see

390
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:58,380
PAP it has an embedded privacy and it

391
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:01,170
has an embedded money in it again I

392
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,720
don't have a time to explain

393
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:07,380
all those ideas in details today I would

394
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:10,200
just rather recommend you to listen to a

395
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,740
talk of Giacomo Zuko just Google Giacomo

396
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,370
Zuko

397
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,190
Ln PvP and he explains why Allen PPP is

398
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:21,629
a new alternative to the internet

399
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:25,110
approach comparing to more less private

400
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:27,120
tcp/ip so a lot of new developments

401
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,029
happens in this fear and

402
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,939
me and my company we are participating

403
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:35,789
in a number of projects starting from

404
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:39,240
the building private digital assets that

405
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:42,720
main word here is private not public

406
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:48,360
like ear c20 meaning that everybody can

407
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,799
track the ownership publicly we on top

408
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,649
of that there is a decentralized

409
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,539
exchange technology for asset and goods

410
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:58,739
can be created on top of lightning

411
00:20:54,539 --> 00:21:00,990
network without a token storage and

412
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,730
messaging with economic guarantees so

413
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,789
you can Google for a storm project

414
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:08,850
better side chains multi-party channels

415
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:10,529
and up to computing including high load

416
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,529
forms of computing like machine learning

417
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:16,590
there's a Prometheus project I will be

418
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:19,559
really briefly covering technical

419
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,889
aspects of these things not to explain

420
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:25,950
you how this thing works but to give you

421
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:29,748
understanding of what can be really done

422
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:33,029
with a such system as Bitcoin and

423
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:36,210
lightning Network and why I think that

424
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:39,059
they can be a technologies that can help

425
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:42,450
us fix the Internet and create all those

426
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:44,610
free markets and Ungerman

427
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:49,139
systems that can push the progress

428
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:51,709
forward there is a lot of technologists

429
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:54,389
probably nobody really heard about

430
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,029
developing being developed in Bitcoin

431
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:59,939
community today and with these

432
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:02,759
technologies we can do a lot of things

433
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,789
that were promised by the theorems smart

434
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:08,389
contracts proof of stake not on a

435
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:11,789
blockchain level because nobody needs it

436
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:13,830
shouting and other stuff so if you are

437
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,049
interested in those you can just write

438
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:18,928
down and search and look for those

439
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:20,940
pieces of technology but all of them

440
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:22,889
allow us to do everything that can

441
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,169
imagine Allah be done for decentralized

442
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:27,689
systems in a scalable and secure way

443
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:30,629
without doing I see us inventing new

444
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:33,499
tokens no token economies and other

445
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:39,240
stars that will be regulated by second

446
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:40,470
traded on a regulated exchanges so we

447
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,809
just need to use the

448
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,679
bit of science they are not crypto magic

449
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:50,100
and the core components to build those

450
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:53,490
systems are game theory for developing a

451
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,990
models sustainable models and again when

452
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,330
I'm talking about game theory I'm not

453
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,950
talking about token economy I'm not

454
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,379
talking about creating talk and

455
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,679
designing how it has to flow through now

456
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:08,640
I'm talking about using money which is

457
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,860
Bitcoin to settle a system where to set

458
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,799
a system where all relations can be

459
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,479
settled in a trustless manner having a

460
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,299
Nash equilibrium so I'm talking about a

461
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,030
scientific game theory zero knowledge

462
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:23,539
which is one of the strongest tool we

463
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:26,750
have today to build private systems and

464
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:29,190
different primitives of this alone PBP

465
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,159
technological stack like complex

466
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:35,640
escrowed contracts lighting network used

467
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,460
them there they can be hdl-c based or

468
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,110
other forms multi-party payment channels

469
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,380
with a partially signed Bitcoin

470
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,260
transactions reach off state of change

471
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,470
state with a client-side validation

472
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:53,070
paradigm which protects blockchain from

473
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:55,140
growing in size indefinitely will so

474
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,510
basically the idea is that data and

475
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,400
state is not served on the layer one in

476
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,140
blockchain they store it on the clients

477
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,419
and by those parties only by those

478
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,150
parties who are involved in some

479
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:10,169
economical gain and economical system

480
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:15,570
but not by everybody in the world so

481
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:17,940
this this promise us that we will be

482
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,600
able to fix those problems of modern

483
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:25,530
internet with this technology stack and

484
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:29,309
I will just run briefly through the

485
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:33,299
details of those technologies okay in

486
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:37,049
which state we know that smart contracts

487
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:40,020
they do require more than just a list of

488
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:42,809
accounts with a balances of them the

489
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,240
complex smart contracts should require a

490
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:48,750
more complex functionality but keeping

491
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,429
data on blockchain doesn't scale so the

492
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:53,110
proper state should be stored somewhere

493
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:54,700
above it on the layer two

494
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,100
and with this idea of client-side

495
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,780
validation and the two mystically

496
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,060
defined cryptographic commitment

497
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:05,889
commitment history we can build

498
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:12,570
completely off chain state histories

499
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:15,220
like a DAC I ought promises but again

500
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,649
there is a trade off between blockchain

501
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,440
and Dec system in blockchain you have a

502
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:22,810
you have a global state but you have a

503
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,910
scalability problem with exact systems

504
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:27,520
you don't have a scalability problem but

505
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:30,070
you have no global state so the proper

506
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,250
way of doing this is just use the layer

507
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,470
1 for a global state but don't store the

508
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,690
data there and store the data but only

509
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:40,930
by those who are interested in those

510
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:43,660
data but commit those data into the

511
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:48,580
security model of the bottom box in a

512
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:52,240
layer it is succinct means the size of

513
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:54,790
these proofs is about zero you can use

514
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,150
electrical curse cryptography to add

515
00:25:54,790 --> 00:26:01,240
information into the public keys without

516
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:04,110
increasing the size of blockchain it is

517
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,240
very private because again you don't and

518
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,580
the state is not in blockchain nobody

519
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,030
other those who have this proofs of the

520
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:17,439
state can know anything about it even

521
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:20,500
miners they can't see that this Bitcoin

522
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,950
transaction has something more than just

523
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,950
a Bitcoin transfer because of the state

524
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,320
bound to this transaction is bound with

525
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:32,050
a zero knowledge and it can't be defined

526
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,629
whether there is some information or

527
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:36,520
assets or anything being passed with

528
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,340
this Bitcoin transaction so the minor

529
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:44,950
incentives to censor transactions

530
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:47,740
doesn't change the use case for this

531
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,720
technology are very broad starting from

532
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,470
a digital assets which we are doing an

533
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,260
RGB project also we are working on the

534
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,300
way how you can even take bitcoins

535
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:02,080
themselves and put them into the state

536
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:05,800
system of chain so adding another layer

537
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,168
of privacy for Bitcoin payments you can

538
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,509
use it to store

539
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:13,629
historically proven records that can be

540
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:15,850
audited by third parties without any

541
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:17,649
blockchain or corporate blockchain or

542
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,799
permission blockchains being required

543
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:25,090
for this case and you can do a decent

544
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:27,460
relies social media systems starting

545
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:30,129
from decentralized github I mean not get

546
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,669
the central decentralized itself but all

547
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:35,590
this but push requires pull requests

548
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:37,629
discussions issues as a social media

549
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,639
they can be decentralized I'm not saying

550
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:41,439
that we need to decentralize Facebook

551
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:44,979
but because I don't know why we need it

552
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:49,059
but if somebody wants you can do even

553
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:51,519
that and we are also using that in our

554
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:57,759
protocol to do a state management in

555
00:27:51,519 --> 00:28:00,129
machine learning tasks the ideas of this

556
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,499
idea the various of this protocol comes

557
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:04,269
from Peter Todd who is also present here

558
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:07,419
and will be giving a talk but on a

559
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:10,480
different topic and it's now developed

560
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:12,759
as a part of our GB project so I propose

561
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,879
everybody who is interested to Google

562
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:18,340
for it because basically I think that is

563
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:20,889
the proper way forward for doing a

564
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,769
proper smart contracts and proper

565
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:26,019
economical systems not a blockchain

566
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:29,559
technology but Ln PPP Bitcoin based

567
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:31,149
technological stack another technology

568
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,129
which is very important is

569
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:34,840
probabilistically checkable proves that

570
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:37,418
can be used it's a form of zero

571
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,980
knowledge being known for decades again

572
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:42,730
it wasn't created by the blockchain

573
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,649
community at all fortunately and it can

574
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:51,009
be combined with the escrowed smart

575
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:55,508
contracts to prove some facts without

576
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:57,700
exposing the original initial data so

577
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,889
you can prove to some party that you

578
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,549
have something or you have computed

579
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:07,299
something and that party still don't see

580
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:10,299
what you have done but it can be argued

581
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:12,429
that actually it was done in a correct

582
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:15,490
way or you really have those data

583
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:18,879
available it sounds like a solution even

584
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,740
to data privacy thing because you can do

585
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:23,409
a genome research

586
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:26,500
without asking everybody to provide the

587
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:29,260
genome data but instead for each of us

588
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,690
computing some something on our own

589
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:34,120
genome and then collecting all those

590
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,350
results together without exposing the

591
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,559
actual genome data

592
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:41,678
it's a scalability technology and today

593
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,750
we use that for creation of data storage

594
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,360
proof in decentralized storage and

595
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,870
messaging protocol and for computational

596
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,850
integrity arguments in machine learning

597
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:55,540
protocol so all these technology it's

598
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:57,669
very well layered I'm sorry I'm ending

599
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,070
with this not interesting technological

600
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:03,309
details and go into more philosophical

601
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:05,669
questions and they are built on top of

602
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:08,620
Bitcoin and you can basically create

603
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,690
different new and new layers of the

604
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,699
centralization starting from data

605
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,070
exchange messaging as cells and good

606
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,470
tokenization storage of the layer 3 on

607
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:20,260
top of that you can build a free open

608
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:23,350
trading system computing search

609
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:25,150
facilities and up to enabling research

610
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:28,360
artificial intelligence progress and

611
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:30,880
immortality as a result of this privacy

612
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:37,050
of this technological stack it's unit

613
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:40,660
for privacy and open markets so by using

614
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:43,270
cryptography to break the observation

615
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:48,580
and attribution we can really achieve a

616
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:51,629
lot and why we need this well who wants

617
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,860
to live forever in a concentration camp

618
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:58,929
you see the answer to those questions

619
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:02,020
are different everybody and no one so we

620
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:04,809
should not trade freedom for a security

621
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:07,559
or sweet promises of some progress or

622
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:10,240
something that somebody will give to us

623
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:12,639
observation and attribution are claimed

624
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,309
to be security measures taken by the

625
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,620
governments but in fact they're anti

626
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:21,250
sovereignty and anti-progress measures

627
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:23,550
and serenity self sovereignty

628
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,020
individualism is the only suit

629
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:29,559
sustainable way for achieving both

630
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:33,129
security and the progress that is the

631
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:34,690
fact which I was trying to show through

632
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:39,580
the presentation

633
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:42,129
today and let's I invite all of you to

634
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,499
participate in breaking an attribution

635
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:47,529
loop the ultimate tool of the

636
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:52,169
government's so what we are building

637
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:55,299
today with a Krypton ARCIC society is a

638
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:57,519
sequence of different sovereignty

639
00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:00,039
technology starting with a Bitcoin as a

640
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,190
digital money adding a private digital

641
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:05,559
assets assets to that enhancing that

642
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,869
with a pure privacy tools tor

643
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:09,869
client-side validation stage channel

644
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:12,129
Onion Routing zero-knowledge

645
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:14,799
building on top of the data sovereignty

646
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:17,168
with a decentralized storage and not

647
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,359
with a GDP our and other technologies I

648
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:22,059
don't have even space to name all of

649
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,189
them and with that with the data

650
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:26,289
integrity and with the financial

651
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:29,649
stability we'll start building a

652
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:32,889
computational Sorority which we have a

653
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:37,449
dedicated protocol here and for which

654
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:40,959
and this all together will help us to

655
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:43,570
build a immortality not in a way that it

656
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,749
will be controlled by a government but

657
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:48,668
in a way that it will be so wearing so

658
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:50,859
you will have a knowledge how to achieve

659
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:52,769
something and nobody will be able to

660
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:55,149
take that knowledge from you

661
00:32:52,769 --> 00:33:00,789
additionally to that of course we need

662
00:32:55,149 --> 00:33:02,469
not only just a privacy and serenity

663
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:05,710
technologies but also a lot of

664
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:08,320
biomedical and neuro computer interface

665
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:11,470
research on euro computer interfaces

666
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,019
which again probably not being wouldn't

667
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:16,269
be done by a more than scientific

668
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:18,580
institutions because of be different be

669
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:21,190
our ethical regulations so the rest of

670
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,080
my time I would like to devote to the

671
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,720
questions of machine learning and

672
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,119
biomedical and neural computing research

673
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,239
so this product I already mentioned it a

674
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:34,599
couple of times this protocol basically

675
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:37,450
enables supercomputers not in the cloud

676
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:41,918
but in a decentralized forms paid with a

677
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:43,690
Bitcoin private and trustless we spend a

678
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,830
lot of resources on doing this research

679
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:48,460
and creating this technology I wouldn't

680
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,679
spend time

681
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:55,300
technical details that utilizes some a

682
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:58,210
lot of game theory and basically we were

683
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,770
able to feed all those different complex

684
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,110
settlement schemes into Bitcoin

685
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:04,720
transaction layer so you don't need a

686
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:09,429
turing-complete smart contracts or ECU

687
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:12,850
and with that we hope that we can make a

688
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:16,379
digital immortality to because the way

689
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:19,360
to build it is spend tens of years

690
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,880
building serenity layers one by one

691
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,950
make machine learning unsensible and

692
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,080
distributed which we try to a queue

693
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:28,480
because you wouldn't be able to do any

694
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,330
modern research any genetics any

695
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,580
biochemical drug research a lot of

696
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:37,120
things without using a machine learning

697
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:40,000
at large at a very large scale and we

698
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,580
are also looking into biomedical and

699
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,920
neuro computer interfaces research that

700
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:49,110
we'll be able to merge you all tissue

701
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:54,040
with a computing do you know what it is

702
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:58,810
it is a NMDA receptor which is present

703
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:01,390
in the brain today for modern processors

704
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:04,240
architectures for inanimate meters is

705
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:07,600
the cutting age while this receptor

706
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,089
which can be probably threaded as a sort

707
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,390
of bio transistor is less than five

708
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:16,270
nanometers so brains are more powerful

709
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:19,180
than any modern percent processor

710
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:22,120
because they probably there is a lot of

711
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,830
research it's not a theory yet it's

712
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,339
hypothesis they probably already

713
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:30,160
suitable and able to utilize some form

714
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:32,770
of quantum computing it can be thousands

715
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,020
of times larger than any modern CPU GPU

716
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:37,810
it doesn't have any problems with

717
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:40,509
cooling did you ever seen a processor of

718
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:42,310
the size of the human brain well it is

719
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:46,390
impossible because there will be huge

720
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:48,820
cooling problems it is more resilient to

721
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:52,000
environment because it is self repairing

722
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:55,780
if you will smash processor with a

723
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,970
hammer it will be destroyed while human

724
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,340
can still survive and continue thinking

725
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,649
sometimes

726
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,700
[Music]

727
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:06,890
so the the the truth is that

728
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:09,740
self-repairing mechanisms of the brain

729
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:12,589
and Ural tissue are magnet use or magnet

730
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:16,549
use of all order larger than of any

731
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:19,670
motor silicon processors so we think

732
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:24,470
that growing chips from neural tissue is

733
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:26,450
actually the future and it can help to

734
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:30,439
solve a lot of problems in machine

735
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:33,169
learning industry and we think with all

736
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:37,940
those tech that I was describing today

737
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:39,740
that event horizon is inevitable we

738
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,890
already have a censorship resistant

739
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:45,350
money in form of Bitcoin we are building

740
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:47,720
new private and free Internet in the

741
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:51,500
form of stack of these protocols that I

742
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:54,680
have described we are trying to create a

743
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:58,430
world unsensible cheap supercomputing

744
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:01,129
for doing machine learning and we are

745
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:05,020
working on some kind of radical AI

746
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:07,430
research that can significantly enhance

747
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:10,190
machine learning that we have today it

748
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,470
is very limited and actually it's not

749
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:14,180
neuromorphic so first of all we need to

750
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,189
create a new neuromorphic type

751
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:20,509
architectures of cognitive architectures

752
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:23,270
and then to intermix hardware with a

753
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:25,490
buyer where I don't know the proper what

754
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:29,270
word of saying that but basically if we

755
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:31,959
are going to achieve some kind of

756
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:35,720
immortality we need to be able to

757
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:39,350
enhance our cognitive abilities and to

758
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,839
be able to interact with a world of

759
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:44,120
computers and machines in a direct way

760
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:48,560
so we need to merge our words two worlds

761
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:54,470
together so this is an ultimate opt-out

762
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:57,259
we aim in to work the humanity parallel

763
00:37:54,470 --> 00:38:01,580
economy with unsensible money and free

764
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:05,180
trade that is what required for that

765
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:08,569
future we need an ultimate darkness of

766
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:10,399
the privacy we need to build a research

767
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,870
outside of the mainstream

768
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,420
government-controlled

769
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:16,279
science with a bioethics committee

770
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,630
and all that kind of stuff because you

771
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,990
wouldn't be able to do all of that

772
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:23,930
without opting out from the current

773
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:25,759
system and we need to work on the

774
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,950
exponential increase of intelligence

775
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,450
abilities developing machine learning

776
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,040
uses in these machine learning to

777
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,049
develop stronger forms of machine

778
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,240
learning to develop stronger force to

779
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:38,329
merge that into our own intelligence

780
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,879
until the exponential process will

781
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:43,220
happen and of course our two normal

782
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,500
swarm weapon systems and a symmetric

783
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:48,140
defense has to be developed as well

784
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:51,650
because outside without that you will be

785
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:55,490
forced by government by a military force

786
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:59,690
to comply to the regulations and not

787
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:02,180
present a national security threat so

788
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:05,359
for those who are interested in this

789
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:08,270
research we are open to discuss that

790
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:12,020
there is there will be no return on any

791
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:14,240
investments no tokens nothing at all

792
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,670
other than maybe this research will help

793
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:21,290
to create some breakthrough technology

794
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:24,109
someday maybe not and I also ask you to

795
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:26,450
visit this manifesto dot ai and maybe

796
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:30,109
sign it if you will agree with with what

797
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:32,618
it says so let's trigger the sequence of

798
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:35,390
events that will lead to something

799
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:41,509
interesting thank you very much

800
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:44,578
[Applause]

801
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:47,640
thank you for very inspiring and

802
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:54,059
provoking presentation in the same time

803
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:56,519
and I think it brought some questions so

804
00:39:54,059 --> 00:40:00,989
if some of you would like to ask don't

805
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:03,209
hesitate to to rise your hand if you

806
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:07,469
still let me some time I would like to

807
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:09,660
ask myself one of the projects you were

808
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:12,499
presenting is called prometheus

809
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:16,769
yeah and it seems you are quite far in

810
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:20,459
in terms of research of possibilities

811
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:23,339
and you have some proof of concept so

812
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,150
what are your upcoming ambitions with

813
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:28,229
this project

814
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:29,609
what sorry the the other ambitions for

815
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:31,819
future with this project with this

816
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:35,759
particular project where you want to

817
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:37,229
what is the what is the other roadmap

818
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:40,469
for this project

819
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:43,078
yeah well this project is a part of that

820
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:45,359
alone PPP technologies and it also

821
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,249
depends on other parts of this

822
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,160
technological stack so right now we are

823
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:53,999
building layer 2 and layer 3 solutions

824
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,249
and on top of that we will be launching

825
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:59,089
the computing network for decentralized

826
00:40:56,249 --> 00:41:01,799
machine learning which will be scalable

827
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:03,900
that's the heart the most hardest the

828
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:05,700
hardest problem because right now with

829
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,130
the current version of Prometheus we are

830
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,049
still depending on Bitcoin transactions

831
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,059
and Bitcoin transaction they don't scale

832
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:15,538
themselves so we are will be putting

833
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:18,989
that into side channels into sorry into

834
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:20,849
state channels into side chains and that

835
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:23,519
Sparta is being developed today and

836
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:25,650
again when when it will be launched

837
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,200
basically it will be a very cheap tool

838
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,630
for doing machine learning stuff and

839
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,618
decentralized and distributed paralized

840
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:38,630
way ok thank you very much space for

841
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:38,630
your questions please raise your hand

842
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,910
so about decentralized machine learning

843
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:51,680
so see this decentralized system will

844
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:54,350
probably be more expensive than the

845
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,589
centralized system like AWS or Google

846
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:59,810
cloud so what is the typical use case

847
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:02,120
for a decentralized system why would

848
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:06,920
they pay more to run my code there

849
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:08,990
rather than on AWS I wouldn't agree that

850
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:14,060
it will be more expensive I will explain

851
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:16,640
why it probably wouldn't but even if it

852
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,279
would be more expensive the main use

853
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,980
case is to do a censorship resistant

854
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,500
computing because if you will be

855
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,060
prohibited from doing some ports forms

856
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,120
of computing and machine learning will

857
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,070
really in a very short term prosperity

858
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,460
will became a national security threat

859
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:36,140
like atomic weapons with each day of the

860
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,210
progress in the artificial intelligence

861
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,460
you will see a more and more censorship

862
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:43,340
today we already have forms of

863
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,020
censorship censorship like open eye they

864
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,430
developed some technology and then

865
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,860
saying that they are not going to

866
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:52,339
publish it because it can create a big

867
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:54,290
problems to all the humanity United

868
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,050
States and Chinese government's saying

869
00:42:54,290 --> 00:43:00,200
that research on artificial intelligence

870
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:02,570
is the national priority and national

871
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,669
security priority so the next step they

872
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:08,030
will be just regulating it and at that

873
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:10,790
point you will have no choice other than

874
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:13,340
to run into some decentralized and

875
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:15,410
censored private environment or not do

876
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:20,570
that with Amazon but it's still it will

877
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:23,000
be cheaper probably because the resource

878
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:27,470
base for these conversations are

879
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:32,960
personal computers and those personal

880
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:35,480
computers as a capex investments people

881
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,070
already have them and they already

882
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,550
maintaining them for the different

883
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:43,180
reasons so if they provide a spare time

884
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:46,940
to do some computing it will give them

885
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,740
some return in terms of money but just

886
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:51,650
to cover electricity and something plus

887
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:53,899
but it still will be much lower expenses

888
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,930
than a larger data center

889
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:59,030
today so the centralized network is

890
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:02,390
economically more efficient especially

891
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:06,460
it has it has some lateral use like any

892
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:08,720
computer has gentlemen in the first row

893
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:11,120
picking up on what you just said Maxine

894
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,549
it wasn't that somewhat of a similar

895
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,859
promise with Bitcoin as Satoshi said one

896
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,240
CPU one vote and then we later still see

897
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,830
SH by a specialization in hardware and

898
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,290
especially the infrastructure of running

899
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:24,370
the hardware so how do you see this

900
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:28,520
playing out compared to a cig mining

901
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:30,859
well it's different spheres the actual

902
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:35,140
plan at some point when the system will

903
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:37,700
be operational is to create cheap nodes

904
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,379
that are able to run the stack of

905
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,259
decentralized protocol starting with

906
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,650
before Bitcoin node self serenity boxes

907
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:48,260
full Bitcoin node lightning Network node

908
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:50,840
storage which will be sold to third

909
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,640
parties so you will be earning money by

910
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,410
having such box because you provide

911
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,930
services to the centralized network and

912
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:59,270
being paid with a Bitcoin you will be a

913
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:01,520
routing lightning network traffic and

914
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:03,800
probably these boxes at some point will

915
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,830
have a special machine learning

916
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,900
processors so they will provide

917
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:11,960
computing they will be as Asics

918
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,700
but the idea that it's not a mining it's

919
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:17,210
a it's better than mining because

920
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:19,970
actually you do a useful work or you

921
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,710
earn some money you buy this device for

922
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,870
I don't know even two thousand dollars

923
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:26,840
but if it earns you a hundred to two

924
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:30,380
hundred dollars each month it's a form

925
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:33,380
of investment and it can be very popular

926
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,750
thing so basically the more people will

927
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,870
buy it the more decentralized network

928
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,880
will be and just don't do as a miners

929
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,470
don't connect them to some pool and you

930
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,340
don't need to pool here because there is

931
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:49,129
no proof of work there is no benefits of

932
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:51,890
assembling into a larger entities so

933
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:57,490
that's there's some initial ideas how it

934
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:57,490
can be done thank you very much

935
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:08,598
please raise your hand more oh thanks

936
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:12,440
thanks so my question is related to

937
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:15,440
Ellen PBP so this is a software layer

938
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,619
and do you think is possible to go

939
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:23,630
completely dark in terms of privacy

940
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:26,630
before these chips with the neural

941
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:29,059
networks you know the the the brain on

942
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:31,520
the chip because you know I don't think

943
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:34,010
we can achieve the privacy total privacy

944
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,549
now because we don't know we don't own

945
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:40,490
our hardware and until we do it's not

946
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:42,380
possible so I think the most important

947
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:45,979
question for the crypto Anarchy right

948
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:49,280
now is to somehow develop our own

949
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:54,170
hardware that that is verifiable through

950
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:57,589
the crypto mechanisms what is the

951
00:46:54,170 --> 00:47:00,849
question yet do you think we can achieve

952
00:46:57,589 --> 00:47:03,470
the are you sure that the getting

953
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:06,200
towards tor towards the complete

954
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:09,890
darkness so in terms of privacy is

955
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:12,078
achievable now with the Allen PPP only

956
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:14,589
because this is a software stack and we

957
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:18,440
still need the hardware yeah well

958
00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:21,369
technically you can do privacy in in a

959
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:23,599
lot of possible ways so there is

960
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:26,270
mathematics for doing that we have

961
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,970
sufficient amount of research but in

962
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:32,990
practice there is a lot of has to be

963
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:36,520
done the thing is that right now in the

964
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:39,799
CPU you can have a backdoor that just

965
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,960
it's it's C it has direct access to the

966
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:44,480
random number generator so what what

967
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,150
stops you you mean that we need an open

968
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:50,420
hardware yes we need we need complete

969
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:52,039
open CPU that we we control the harbor

970
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:55,430
from from the grown up

971
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:58,010
yeah that's an actual problem and this

972
00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:00,410
is very hard there is no easy way to

973
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:03,289
solve it because producing hardware is

974
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:05,660
much harder than software maybe maybe

975
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:08,539
one of ideas I'm not saying that it is

976
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:11,808
the route forward but we can start with

977
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:12,590
a modern unsecured and private way even

978
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:14,750
we will have

979
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:16,190
more efficient decentralized

980
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:19,520
supercomputing which is censorship

981
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:22,850
resistant it can be used to design open

982
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,920
standards for hardware because the next

983
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:27,350
generation of hardware can be created

984
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,540
opened but we wouldn't be able to

985
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:32,089
replace the modern generation of

986
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,340
hardware easily it will take a lot of

987
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:37,100
time fortunately it still will be hard

988
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:40,670
to censor through the hardware much

989
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:42,319
harder than through the software thank

990
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:45,980
you very much we are running out of time

991
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:48,260
so I would like to thank you thank you

992
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:57,820
for your presentation thank you for

993
00:48:48,260 --> 00:49:02,410
coming and in in 10 minutes you can

994
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:02,410
attend another lecture thanking

995
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:10,599
you
