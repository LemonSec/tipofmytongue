00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:34,290
hello litecoin is prime is cheap and

4
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,980
fast therefore it is the future moon

5
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,129
arrow is private and has scaleable box

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,610
size therefore it is the future some

7
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,580
other coin has quantum resistance

8
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,850
therefore is the future

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:53,580
let me introduce economists longtime bit

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,890
corner and trader tone ways who will

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:06,360
explain to you why all these claims our

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:12,030
 so enjoy thank you for that Wow

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:14,850
no pressure at all everyone Wow full

14
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,160
room this is excellent thank you so much

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,559
thank you everybody for coming thank you

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,170
hackers Congress for inviting me back I

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,840
believe this is my third straight year

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,750
here speaking how many of you were here

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,750
last year and watched me present right

20
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,160
here on the same stage alright oh not

21
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,569
that many people I show brought the same

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,179
presentation back this is a brand new

23
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:38,759
one so we have to change it up those

24
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:41,940
that work here last year would have seen

25
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,890
my presentation on called Bitcoin value

26
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,470
proposition where I talked about the

27
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,380
history of Bitcoin and why it's

28
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,020
economically useful and why the world

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,250
will most likely adopt it in this

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,899
presentation we'll take a slightly

31
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,929
different turn and we're gonna talk

32
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,599
about why Bitcoin will be the only

33
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:02,280
cryptocurrency left standing when it's

34
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,360
all said and done I'm not gonna spend

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,729
too much time talking about myself

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,110
everyone knows how to use Google so you

37
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,419
can go ahead and just throw my name in

38
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,420
there I have a have a youtube channel

39
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,799
where I do daily videos lately they've

40
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,500
just been asleep been about price

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,080
analysis just been travelling too much

42
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,730
other than that there's lost shows

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,040
there's used to be new shows I'll try to

44
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,720
bring those back the crypto scam series

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,720
was very popular I have a couple of

46
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,280
conferences called uncomfortable

47
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,230
understanding Bitcoin and the financial

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,870
summit I don't have that logo in this

49
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,488
particular photo so now my other

50
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,069
presentation on bitcoins value

51
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,480
proposition ran a little long and

52
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,399
this was the last slide of that

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,319
presentation that I never had time to

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,469
get to so I decided to build a

55
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:49,560
presentation specifically around my very

56
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:52,049
last slide in the presentation on

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,019
bitcoins value proposition and I wanted

58
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,879
to just classify all of the stuff we

59
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:01,109
have in the crypto space other than

60
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,239
Bitcoin into a Venn diagram and I

61
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:07,530
quickly realized that I have to use a

62
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:10,139
four circle Venn diagram and now that

63
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,849
many coins are starting to merge my with

64
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,239
Bitcoin because they can't survive on

65
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,469
their own this may have to be a five

66
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,599
circle Venn diagram in the future

67
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:20,668
because everybody keeps pivoting but

68
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,948
we're gonna stick with the four Venn

69
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:26,489
diagram for now so how are we gonna

70
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:30,750
break down these old coins we have proof

71
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:32,069
of work we have icos and air drops we

72
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,349
have proof of stake

73
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,510
I believe nem is proof of importance I

74
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,698
use proof of other you can use proof of

75
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,530
trees whatever you like IBM was talking

76
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:44,189
about proof of time whatever the hell

77
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,409
that means but on so this is proof of

78
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:48,540
other and then we have our databases

79
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,269
this is your blockchains your

80
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,698
decentralized Ledger's and anything

81
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,939
that's really a database but they call

82
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,739
it a blockchain so let's go back to the

83
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:02,009
beginning almost every single one of my

84
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,349
presentation begins with the same slide

85
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,668
I'm sure how many of you here have read

86
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:09,268
the Satoshi white paper

87
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,900
all right the majority of the hands that

88
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,290
that's great

89
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,879
now you really almost didn't have to

90
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,709
read the Satoshi white paper unless you

91
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,649
technologically inclined all you had to

92
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,358
do was read the abstract of the Satoshi

93
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,698
white paper and you really start to

94
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,340
understand what the innovation is and

95
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:30,150
what Satoshi accomplished so I'm just

96
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:32,580
gonna read two sentences from all three

97
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,460
sentences from the abstract of the white

98
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,740
paper digital signatures provide part of

99
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,948
the solution but the main benefits are

100
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,979
lost if a trusted third party is still

101
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:45,840
required to prevent double spending we

102
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,760
propose a solution to the double

103
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,400
spending problem using peer-to-peer

104
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,688
network the network timestamps

105
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,119
transactions by

106
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:57,029
hashing them into an ongoing chain of

107
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:59,549
hash-based proof-of-work forming a

108
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:03,269
record that cannot be changed without

109
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:04,558
redoing the proof of work that is the

110
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,409
innovation right there

111
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:10,169
that's what Satoshi solved he solved

112
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:13,110
double spending and he solved it with

113
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,419
proof of work that's it the word

114
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,759
blockchain does not appear anywhere in

115
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,068
the Satoshi white paper the word

116
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,639
blockchain was a note in the code I

117
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,379
think that's my next slide actually that

118
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,619
yep that's why it's gonna come up next

119
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:30,629
and I just want to point out you really

120
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:32,249
want to read the references the

121
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:36,119
references Toshi white paper is very

122
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:39,899
important so four of them refer to the

123
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:42,389
work by I think I think person is Steve

124
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,949
stone Etta I actually met him at a

125
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,349
recent conference had an interview with

126
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:48,899
him was very interesting and Adam Beck's

127
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:52,558
work on Hashcash was also very very

128
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:54,809
critical so what does that mean like

129
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:56,849
where does this word blockchain even

130
00:05:54,809 --> 00:06:01,319
come from well it comes from here it

131
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:04,739
comes from a note a comment in in the

132
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,050
code that says when they solve proof of

133
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:09,628
work they broadcast the block to

134
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,989
everyone and the block is added to the

135
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:15,149
blockchain in Satoshi's original work I

136
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:17,609
don't have screenshots of that he

137
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:20,189
referred to it as a time chain and then

138
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:23,519
he changed the wording to blockchain but

139
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:25,589
that's not the innovation the innovation

140
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,269
is proof of work so anytime you hear a

141
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:28,739
proof of stake solves the problem proof

142
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:31,739
of stake has existed even before

143
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:33,748
computers the concept is not is there

144
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:35,518
whoever has the most gets to earn the

145
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:36,839
most and gets to control the most that's

146
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,239
proof of stake

147
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,610
there's nothing innovative there proof

148
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:43,709
of work was the actual innovation so

149
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,219
let's stick with proof of work why is

150
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:50,909
that so important and for that we're

151
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:53,129
gonna go and look at a footnote from the

152
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:55,139
Bitcoin standard a book that I recommend

153
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:58,800
everybody read how many of you have read

154
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,419
the Bitcoin standard excellent now put

155
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,329
those hands down how many of you should

156
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,840
read the Bitcoin standard every other

157
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:08,310
hand should go up

158
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,560
all right so here it is a lot of

159
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,590
projects demonize mining mining is now

160
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,710
like what the a Viet country mining

161
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,510
takes up more electricity then the only

162
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,489
like like 80 countries take up more

163
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,750
electricity than mining and eventually

164
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,910
it's gonna be in the top 10 and

165
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,760
eventually we'll probably more than any

166
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,710
single country but proof-of-work yet

167
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,389
demonized for being bad for the

168
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,430
environment that could be a whole other

169
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,650
presentation but let's just talk about

170
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,650
the economics of it the question of

171
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,380
whether Bitcoin wastes electricity is at

172
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,289
its heart a misunderstanding of the

173
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,850
fundamentally subjective nature of value

174
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:48,610
electricity is generated worldwide and

175
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,680
large quantities to satisfy the needs of

176
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,810
consumers the only judgment about

177
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,440
whether this electricity has gone to

178
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,540
waste or not lies with the consumer who

179
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,450
pays for it people who are willing to

180
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,940
pay the cost of the operation of the

181
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,760
Bitcoin network for their transactions

182
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,280
are effectively financing this

183
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,070
electricity consumption which means the

184
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,580
electricity is being produced to satisfy

185
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,870
consumer needs and has not been wasted

186
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,050
functionally speaking proof of work is

187
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,660
the only method humans have invented for

188
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,640
creating digital hard money if people

189
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,419
find that worth paying for the

190
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,380
electricity has not been wasted ok so

191
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,439
keep that in mind

192
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,530
that of proof of work now let's talk

193
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,870
about how proof of work eventually came

194
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,539
about a lot of people think that Bitcoin

195
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:44,140
just randomly got created by Satoshi and

196
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,330
about six months later someone who is

197
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,580
able to change three lines in bitcoins

198
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,970
code says I solved the problem I did it

199
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,760
better

200
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,520
these are your vitalik and everybody

201
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,270
else so let's go back let's go back a

202
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:02,920
while let's say this is an email

203
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:04,930
exchange from 2001 I'll mention who sent

204
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,680
the exchange after but let's read the

205
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,939
end of this like the end of this email

206
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,290
and then I'll talk about who it's from

207
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,500
so here it is

208
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,180
someone has wrote in this in an email

209
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,839
personally I like the idea of hash cash

210
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,250
this is going back to Adam Beck's

211
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:25,000
personally I like the idea of cash cash

212
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,430
cash if and only if it's structured like

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,160
a real currency as opposed to simply

214
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:33,459
proof of work in the real world you pay

215
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,860
for resources used in many cases this

216
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:38,619
should also apply to peer-to-peer and

217
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,020
other computer systems of course getting

218
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,149
Hashcash workable as a real currency is

219
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,410
extremely difficult I've thought of a

220
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,050
scheme that would work

221
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,209
coins are signed by owner and can only

222
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,839
be changed signed to a different owner

223
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:55,449
by the owner except you need a

224
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,570
decentralized central database of all

225
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:01,839
the hash cash that's been minted

226
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,730
unworkable spend twice problem.the

227
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,899
spend twice problem and attempting to

228
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:11,649
solve it has been worked on for a long

229
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:13,209
time this is 2001 okay and this was an

230
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,370
email to Hal Finney

231
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:17,589
and a couple of other people from the

232
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,230
free net project who wrote this email

233
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:22,110
that was Peter Todd who may or may not

234
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:26,860
be in this room but he's in the building

235
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:28,420
and he wrote this when he was 15 in a

236
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,240
conversation with Hal Finney on a

237
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,420
Saturday afternoon at 12 o'clock in the

238
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,829
afternoon so people have been trying to

239
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,560
solve this problem for a really really

240
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:40,359
long time a lot smarter people than the

241
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,329
ones that came around immediately after

242
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,730
bitcoin came out so when you hear

243
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:47,410
someone that says I solved it like I I

244
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,839
solved the problem well it was the one

245
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,699
that's popular these days hash graphs or

246
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,980
whatever like people are coming up with

247
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,779
these things like yesterday you gotta

248
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,880
realize that people have been working on

249
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:01,029
this for 20 years very very smart people

250
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,300
and bitcoin is the end result of the

251
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:06,670
best thinking that there was okay and

252
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,819
that's another so next time somebody

253
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,260
releases some other cryptocurrency ask

254
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,450
them what they were doing when they were

255
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:16,800
15 years old on a Saturday okay were

256
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:19,089
they trying to solve proof of work okay

257
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,810
we're trying to create proof of work to

258
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:25,240
solve double spend I mean okay so what

259
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,959
makes Bitcoin unique what gives Bitcoin

260
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,690
value well the same thing that gives all

261
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,229
currencies value and that is confidence

262
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,420
in

263
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,250
not currency people always talk about

264
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,110
how the US dollar is gonna get the

265
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,060
throne as the world reserve currency or

266
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,250
really which country is gonna be the

267
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,000
next world reserve currency who you

268
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,720
gonna trust

269
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,160
I keep hearing Russia has all this gold

270
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,630
Russia is gonna back their currency buy

271
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,410
gold and they're gonna work together

272
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:55,960
with China unless you can send the up

273
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,089
airplane full of rubles to Russia and

274
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,710
expect Putin to send you a smaller

275
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,480
airplane full of gold back

276
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,680
no one's gonna trust the Russian

277
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,440
currency as the world reserve currency

278
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,329
I'm sorry okay the reason why the US

279
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,160
dollar is the world reserve currency is

280
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,530
because the world trusts the

281
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,980
transparency of the US government and

282
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:17,530
the the and that's the money you want to

283
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,800
hold in your pocket anywhere in the

284
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,720
world over any other fiat currency so

285
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,140
this is where Bitcoin also gets its

286
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,540
value the immutability is not a feature

287
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,150
of the Bitcoin software which is trivial

288
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:34,030
to change for anyone with coding skills

289
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:37,449
but rather is grounded in the economics

290
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,670
of the currency and network and stems

291
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,980
from the difficulty of getting every

292
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,439
member of the network to adopt the same

293
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:47,080
change to the software again I'm quoting

294
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,320
from the Bitcoin standard right here's a

295
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,600
quote from Satoshi himself in six months

296
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,320
after Bitcoin was released the nature of

297
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,590
Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1

298
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,950
was released the core design was set in

299
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:05,260
stone for the rest of its lifetime the

300
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:08,590
fact that Bitcoin can't be easily

301
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:11,470
changed is what gives the world and the

302
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,810
people confidence that there will be 21

303
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,000
million bitcoins their transactions will

304
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,709
go through that there will not be anyone

305
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,470
in the middle of those transactions and

306
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,420
for me the most important part and I'm

307
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,540
kind of wearing it on my shirt is the

308
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,939
fact that Bitcoin is the only asset

309
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,670
humans have ever owned that is

310
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,590
uncomfortable anything else you have

311
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,449
ever owned in your life could be

312
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,640
confiscated from you by someone with a

313
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,860
bigger gun

314
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:42,189
except Bitcoin okay that's the one thing

315
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:45,880
you can keep that's valuable and the

316
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:48,280
events of Cyprus and Greece

317
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,460
if you guys remember you're not too far

318
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:56,260
here in Europe will not happen to your

319
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:58,360
money if it's in Bitcoin so sticking

320
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,000
with the book talking about hard money

321
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,550
so now we're about to get into the

322
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,490
concept of why is it gonna be Bitcoin

323
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:09,699
and not other cryptocurrencies so quick

324
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:12,670
quotes on hard money hard money by

325
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,470
taking the question of supply out of the

326
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,170
hands of governments and their

327
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,510
economists would force everyone to be

328
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,699
productive to society instead of seeking

329
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,610
to get rich through the fool's errand of

330
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:27,280
monetary manipulation international

331
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,410
economic summits are convened where

332
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,110
world leaders try to negotiate each

333
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:35,170
other's acceptable currency devaluation

334
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:39,280
making the value of the currency an

335
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:41,770
issue of geopolitical importance for

336
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,170
every other money as its value Rises

337
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,210
those who can produce it will start to

338
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,819
produce more of it whether it's rice

339
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,010
stones seashells silver gold copper or

340
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,970
government money everyone will have an

341
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:57,250
incentive to try to produce more Bitcoin

342
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:00,190
is the hardest money ever invented

343
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,860
growth in its value cannot possibly

344
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,890
increase its supply it can only make the

345
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,680
network more secure and immune to attack

346
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:12,939
and it makes Bitcoin fundamentally

347
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,650
different from every other money so

348
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,830
that's the background now let's talk

349
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:21,640
about specific cryptocurrencies in the

350
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,990
space now they can pretend that they're

351
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,510
not competing with Bitcoin but in

352
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,300
reality they that's what they want to do

353
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:31,180
that's the only reason why you would go

354
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:35,349
ahead and invent it so let's talk about

355
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:37,780
the most popular one and that is light

356
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,460
coin the badges that you guys are

357
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,990
wearing you can go ahead and spend light

358
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:45,400
coin so why is light coin I'm gonna make

359
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,350
the case that light coin will not

360
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,140
succeed and why light coin will go to

361
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,810
zero so here's a quote from Charlie Li

362
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,000
light coin is the silver to bitcoins

363
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,969
gold it must be true since it's written

364
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,950
in the Bitcoin blockchain okay so once

365
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:04,570
again the Bitcoin blockchain is rough

366
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:08,350
even encoding how it's gold and then

367
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:12,730
there's a statement right below someone

368
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:15,460
replied to Charlie Lee if it's true that

369
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,529
Bitcoin is the gold to mine arrows

370
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,529
platinum and we'll get to Manero in a

371
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:24,040
minute so here's a little more detail

372
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:26,890
from Charlie Lee on I know like coin

373
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,770
being silver to bitcoins gold Bitcoin is

374
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:33,040
gold like corner silver and XRP are

375
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:35,319
diamonds that was a quote from Charlie

376
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,439
Lee I was actually really curious on the

377
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,330
XRP our diamonds part I don't know if

378
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,510
anyone here has seen my crypto scam

379
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:46,660
would Peter thought about Ripple so as

380
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,640
everyone knows I'm not a fan I just sent

381
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,719
out a recent tweet about ripple and it

382
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:56,610
had like 450 comments and I think over

383
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,589
400 of them bore by ripple people and I

384
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:02,529
speak at like 40 conferences a year I'm

385
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:05,290
probably between meetups and public

386
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:07,720
events and events I'm probably a close

387
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,449
to 50 events a year never once had I

388
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,120
seen an actual person of the ripple army

389
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:15,370
wearing a ripple t-shirt Vernor ripple

390
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,780
hat like they're all bots they're all

391
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,948
fake they're probably getting paid

392
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,470
because ripple is just printing money

393
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:23,230
anyway a little side pension so I was

394
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:26,220
curious on the diamonds part so Charlie

395
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:29,650
Charlie Lee elaborates the extreme

396
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,630
centralization of XRP makes him share

397
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,730
specific characteristics with a diamond

398
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,220
market first of all centralization

399
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:39,910
allows for some manipulation charlie

400
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:43,630
also commented that holding ripple is is

401
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:46,240
good news for fiat lovers so I was

402
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,070
curious on ripple chart versus the price

403
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,830
of diamonds and it's actually very very

404
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:52,928
similar so so right here the blue is the

405
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,540
price of diamonds that went unreasonably

406
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:58,179
high in 1980 and there's your price of

407
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,800
diamonds today and of course it is fully

408
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,260
controlled and completely manipulated

409
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,350
and that's very easy to tell because

410
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,780
diamonds do not have futures contracts I

411
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,270
am NOT able to participate in the price

412
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,129
discovery of diamonds but I am able to

413
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,379
participate in the price discovery of

414
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,760
oil

415
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,710
gold/silver it doesn't matter and

416
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,230
there's your chart of ripple right there

417
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,419
next to it that it's a little old now

418
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,980
it's from back in July the year is

419
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:26,080
almost over I should probably update I

420
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,840
do expect this to keep going down

421
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,230
because ripple is totally centralized

422
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,580
and completely useless so so here's my

423
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,039
case for why

424
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,020
litecoin is not much different and I'm

425
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,020
gonna quote once again from the Bitcoin

426
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,539
standard by the 19th century however

427
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,149
with the development of modern banking

428
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:49,210
and the improvement in methods of

429
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:52,600
communication individuals could transact

430
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:55,750
with paper money and cheques backed by

431
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,709
gold in the Treasuries of their banks

432
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:02,799
and central banks this made gold backed

433
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:06,100
transactions possible at any scale thus

434
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,500
obviating the need for Silver's monetary

435
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,379
role and gathering all essential

436
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:14,020
monetary saleability properties in the

437
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,880
gold standard and that is a very very

438
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,220
critical statement that a lot of people

439
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,230
haven't really considered a lot of

440
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,409
silver promoters you know the gold bugs

441
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:26,710
that also think that silver can go to

442
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:29,590
$5,000 an ounce they're basing this on

443
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,890
like multi thousand year history that

444
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:35,110
silver was more money more common money

445
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,510
than gold and that made sense because a

446
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,580
thousand years ago even a gram of gold

447
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,440
would buy you too much stuff so if you

448
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,740
wanted to buy a cup of coffee you had to

449
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,590
use silver it was the micro payment to

450
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,320
gold but all that changed with the

451
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:53,289
advent of electricity and modern banking

452
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,350
and in today's world the internet so

453
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:59,770
once you're able to use gold at any

454
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:02,020
scale there's no longer a monetary need

455
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:04,629
for silver and this is why recently we

456
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:08,559
saw the silver to gold ratio hit a

457
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:11,320
hundred where geologically it's 17 to 1

458
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:15,279
or so and a lot of people are saying

459
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,439
well if there is 17 times more if gold

460
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:22,149
is 17 times more rare than silver they

461
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,130
should be priced at 17 to 1 but Gold's

462
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:26,289
value is mostly speculation on its

463
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,070
monetary property which is also for

464
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,399
silver

465
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:32,678
less so every single decade and people

466
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,620
will realize that so you don't need a

467
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:39,399
micro payment if your actual better

468
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:42,518
harder money can scale so as Bitcoin

469
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:45,340
scales with lightning

470
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:49,059
litecoin will no longer be needed as

471
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:51,580
that micro payment and this was actually

472
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:53,379
pointed out by looked at Junior who

473
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,320
explained it very very well

474
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,269
and this was back in 2013 where he

475
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:03,250
stated well I should I'm gonna read this

476
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:06,580
part to Bitcoin by Nature can only

477
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,279
provide the same value put into it so in

478
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,799
its raw state it functions as nothing

479
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,200
more than a pump and dump scam as it

480
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:17,049
simply redistributes money from the

481
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,070
buyer to the seller the reason why

482
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:22,980
Bitcoin itself escapes this category is

483
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,269
that it is a major technological

484
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,539
innovation bringing something new

485
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:30,879
trustless currency that has value to the

486
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:33,460
world by being adopted as a currency

487
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:35,980
Bitcoin can benefit even those who buy

488
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,340
into it last so he makes the point that

489
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,019
because bitcoin is an actual innovation

490
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:44,918
that's what prevents it from being a

491
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:48,279
pump and dump scam like tulips because

492
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,740
tulips were not an innovation he goes on

493
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:52,720
to say litecoin and other scam coins

494
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,000
like it on the other hand do not bring

495
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,440
anything new to the table they are just

496
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,899
mere clones that retain the

497
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,059
pump-and-dump nature of bitcoin but

498
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:03,639
without the innovation that makes

499
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:06,370
Bitcoin viable as a currency like coin

500
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:08,860
specifically made 3 irrelevant changes

501
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,289
they changed the proof-of-work function

502
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,610
from shaw to script and then he explains

503
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:18,070
how that's not any better faster target

504
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,199
block time this is often passed off as

505
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,110
faster confirmation but in reality it

506
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,870
isn't at all to get the same security as

507
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:28,059
six Bitcoin blocks like coin would need

508
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,668
24 blocks and I believe that's even more

509
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:33,519
now because they have a lot less mining

510
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:36,340
hash rate and finally larger currency

511
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,710
supply we all know that one Bitcoin is

512
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,220
divisible to a decimal places so there's

513
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,970
more micro Bitcoin

514
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:46,360
then litecoin so no silver to gold so

515
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:49,519
all of this has been debunked you know

516
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:53,449
six years ago now that you're not going

517
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,769
to need a micro payment so that's one of

518
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,659
the biggest problems but like coin I

519
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:01,149
don't have I don't have this in the

520
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:03,649
slides but I'll add the fact that so

521
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:06,100
bitcoins hash rate continues to grow

522
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:09,469
more and more people continue to mine it

523
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,719
and for Bitcoin because the hash rate is

524
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,850
growing so fast Bitcoin will probably

525
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,980
need to more than double in price every

526
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,439
four years just think about it right

527
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,720
Bitcoin that way does way better than

528
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,700
doubling in price every four years there

529
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,940
were only ten years in we have to give

530
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,909
it more time but in reality as long as

531
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,190
Bitcoin only goes up doubles in price

532
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,720
every four years the current level of

533
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:36,080
mining will continue to make the same

534
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,250
amount of money and Bitcoin can continue

535
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,990
doing this for like another hundred

536
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,269
years all has to do is just double in

537
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,669
price every four years and our current

538
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:45,649
hash rate and security stays the same

539
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:49,039
and it's so much higher than any other

540
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:51,168
currency for some like light coin if it

541
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,559
doesn't double in a four-year stretch if

542
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:57,080
it doesn't double by the next having who

543
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,509
would mine it and that's a big problem

544
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,840
so every single proof-of-work coin

545
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:04,970
besides Bitcoin is that risk of like a

546
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,980
mining death spiral like no one would

547
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,750
mind it also who would invest in

548
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,500
research and development to create new

549
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,820
mining technology for other coins if

550
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,879
they don't trust the fact that they're

551
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:21,559
going to be around so these other before

552
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:23,059
coins have a major problem with with

553
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:25,129
their mining structure which is why

554
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:26,990
they're either gonna all switch to proof

555
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:29,059
of stake you're seeing a theory I'm

556
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,039
trying to do that already but they

557
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:33,529
always said that from the beginning so

558
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,370
you're gonna see all of these coins they

559
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:40,580
have three choices they will either

560
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:43,879
drastically increase the number of coins

561
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:46,908
they to reward the miners they can

562
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:48,649
switch the proof of stake or what's been

563
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:51,139
happening already you're gonna start

564
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:53,560
merged mining with Bitcoin because

565
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:56,290
otherwise your mining will simply fail

566
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,909
so let's talk about Manero see I'm an

567
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:00,399
arrow sign right there I'm not exactly

568
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:04,030
sure what that is but I'll find out

569
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,590
so the privacy side well you need to use

570
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:09,970
Manero because it's more private than

571
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:13,060
Bitcoin well sure an arrow does have

572
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,280
privacy at its base level but it's

573
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,090
debatable whether that's a good thing or

574
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,860
a bad thing

575
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:21,790
it makes Manero a lot more complicated

576
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:24,310
to work with and it also creates

577
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:27,399
potential inflation bugs that you may

578
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:31,030
not know exists that's that's the same

579
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:35,700
problem that people speculate on easy

580
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:38,889
cash and here are all of the privacy

581
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,780
improvements to Bitcoin that are either

582
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,970
already implemented or going to be

583
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:49,870
implemented soon our signatures taproot

584
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:52,150
bulletproof music coin pay joint joint

585
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,610
markets mass crafts for confidential

586
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,930
transactions for sabe wallet and samurai

587
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:59,290
wallets they're already mixing

588
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:01,600
transactions lightning / Thor the liquid

589
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:04,889
side chain so a lot of people use manera

590
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,810
well if you have Bitcoin and you want to

591
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,670
the anomalies your Bitcoin just moving

592
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,560
into Manero and then move it back into

593
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,300
Bitcoin but now you're using some kind

594
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,280
of a centralized exchange so you're not

595
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,379
really being that private but moving

596
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,330
your Bitcoin into liquid Bitcoin and

597
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,670
then moving them back out without taking

598
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:25,990
on any currency risk or any exchange

599
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:28,540
risk surg does the same gives you the

600
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,790
same kind of anonymity and as far as

601
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,760
your transaction anonymity that's coming

602
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:35,970
and maybe you will never be as good as

603
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,300
Manero but certainly be good enough for

604
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:42,970
99.9% of the people using it so here's a

605
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:45,250
little slide I put together of how all

606
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:49,450
of these old coins and we like to call

607
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:51,760
ship coins come about well ever since

608
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,010
Bitcoin and I have to give credit to my

609
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,930
friend Giacomo Zuko on this one we were

610
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,730
just chatting or he might have mentioned

611
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:59,950
it in one of his presentations and he

612
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:03,460
didn't even probably realize how

613
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:06,880
critical that statement was but Satoshi

614
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:10,510
was able to create Bitcoin and he knew

615
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,890
was going to be money and after that

616
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:18,370
happened people suddenly saw way to

617
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:20,770
monetize a line of code so it goes

618
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:23,080
something like this oh my god

619
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,870
I just coated the greatest privacy

620
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,060
encryption protocol of all time and you

621
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:30,310
can reply to that but is it backwards

622
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:33,730
compatible with Bitcoin can it be

623
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:35,710
implemented as a soft fork and here are

624
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,320
your choices if the answer is yes and

625
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:40,810
it's a great improvement to Bitcoin and

626
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,439
it could be backwards compatible it will

627
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:47,320
be implemented if it's not has anyone

628
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,540
tried to monetize it yet yes it's a

629
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,520
coin and no then it's gonna be a future

630
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,620
ship point because it will never get the

631
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,129
critical mass of Bitcoin what makes

632
00:27:53,620 --> 00:28:00,340
Bitcoin valuable is the fact that its

633
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:04,000
first two years of existence is not

634
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:07,689
replicatable miners were mining it at a

635
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,210
loss it was worthless developers were

636
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,480
coding it because they wanted to it was

637
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:16,690
worthless this is why you have thousands

638
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,320
of Bitcoin in landfills on old hard

639
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,070
drives

640
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:24,639
you cannot monetize a piece of code

641
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:26,560
today promote it and everyone that buys

642
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,650
into it from day one is expecting to get

643
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,350
rich on it that's not how it works

644
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:35,740
that's not how decentralization works ok

645
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:37,810
so ever since Bitcoin every time someone

646
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,240
comes up with a line of code that they

647
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:43,179
think is innovative where in the past it

648
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,250
would simply be an interesting piece of

649
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:48,160
code to be implemented for encryption

650
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:50,860
today I'm gonna make a currency out of

651
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,890
it and get rich and those projects will

652
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,419
always fail alright let's take a look at

653
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,240
a few more of these I got about 5 more

654
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:00,250
minutes so let's take a look at Zee cash

655
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,680
well what's the problem with Zee cash

656
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:06,070
well they are essentially controlled

657
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,230
company so so here is the cash when

658
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,429
building Zee cash the Zee cash company

659
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,690
chose to take a slightly different

660
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:17,460
approach allocating a portion of issued

661
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:20,170
Zee cash to early investors and founders

662
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,730
distributed over the first four years of

663
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,450
the prod

664
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,950
historically they have been very

665
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,249
transparent sure

666
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:30,549
80% of issued Z cash goes to the miners

667
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:32,590
three percent goes to the foundation 2.8

668
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:34,269
percent is going to the Z cash company

669
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,360
that controls everything and the

670
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:39,580
remaining 14% is basically given out to

671
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,769
employees who the creator himself and

672
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,570
the four years is almost up and they're

673
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:45,700
about to go broke so how are they going

674
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,710
to pay their developers this is why they

675
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,869
want to take more money from the miners

676
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,309
these are all simply for-profit

677
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:53,408
companies they have absolutely nothing

678
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:55,990
to do with a distributed currency

679
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:59,019
Zuka Wilcox pushes for new developer

680
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,970
fund to support Z cash so basically you

681
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:03,190
have a person that just simply wants to

682
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,840
make money by writing code the rest of

683
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,879
his life that is totally useless and

684
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,139
people will continue to pay for that so

685
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:11,259
he wants to basically pay himself

686
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,729
another I don't know I don't know what

687
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:14,230
he pays himself two hundred thousand a

688
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,029
month hundred thousand a month whatever

689
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,249
it is he just wants to keep paying that

690
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:19,690
forever in order to just program Z cash

691
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,399
for as long as possible even though no

692
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:26,080
one in their right mind is ever gonna

693
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:30,369
use it we can talk about - as well

694
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,990
- started out as X coin then they

695
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:34,149
rebranded to dark coin then they

696
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,070
rebranded to - pay and they're probably

697
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:37,748
gonna rebrand again because of all the

698
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:40,720
scam in nature in the beginning of it

699
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:43,899
basically you create a bunch of currency

700
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,490
in the first hour of its existence and

701
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:47,289
then you claim that it was by accident

702
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,879
but it's a good thing because now we

703
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:52,210
have money to you know pay our

704
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:53,980
developers you also lie about how many

705
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,529
coins you're gonna have and then a day

706
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,029
later you divide that by four so that

707
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:01,679
the amount of currency you create for

708
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:04,749
yourself is no longer 5% but is now 20%

709
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,360
so there's lots of lots of lots of scary

710
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:09,249
things that went on from announcing that

711
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,258
it was going to be a for-profit project

712
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:15,279
from the before the launch

713
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:16,840
- clearly doing it on purpose at the

714
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,389
launch and printing a bunch of money for

715
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,519
yourself let's move over ice to do these

716
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:24,879
graphics I got about a few more minutes

717
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,999
so let's move over to steam it another

718
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:29,859
amazing concept of I will just create my

719
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:32,799
own money and I will pay you in my own

720
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:34,960
money to post on my website and we will

721
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,360
have the most centralized

722
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,120
website like credit known to man where

723
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,240
20 or 30 people decide what is displayed

724
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,239
on the front page of our website of your

725
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,480
content all under the disguise of it is

726
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:53,980
a decentralized blockchain of some form

727
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,260
so this was my knowledge chart and I

728
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,840
used to it was great I had the Dow right

729
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:01,270
here I had the Dow I tweeted this out

730
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,530
with the Dow right before my own stupid

731
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,690
and that was like a week before the Dow

732
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,010
imploded so that was perfect timing

733
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,080
I think people are starting to realize

734
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,760
by now that steamin is basically a bunch

735
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,240
of guys printing their own money trying

736
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,680
to convince you to put your content

737
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,750
there they will pay you in their own

738
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,060
money and then somebody is buying that

739
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:23,140
from you and you're basically diluting

740
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:25,240
other people with monopoly money let's

741
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,100
go to very tasty I'm another one of

742
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,920
these IPOs that is currently in a lot of

743
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:32,290
trouble with the SEC I did an interview

744
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,790
in Reggie Middleton as he was launching

745
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:36,000
this and I questioned pretty much

746
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:38,920
everything that he's now in trouble for

747
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,990
tried to warn him but didn't work so

748
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,750
this is what happens when you do an IC

749
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:46,540
o---- though now what happened with iOS

750
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:48,460
just a little slap on the wrist and they

751
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,889
can go on and continue with their

752
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,920
security rootstock was another one

753
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:55,720
popular blockchain that was gonna do

754
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,240
smart contracts on top of Bitcoin

755
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,520
unfortunately for rootstock the liquid

756
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,590
side chain will do everything that we're

757
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,720
going to do but better and simpler

758
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,870
because it's literally a Bitcoin

759
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,120
sidechain without an extra currency and

760
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,770
this is so if anyone is not familiar

761
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,600
with the liquid side chain now you

762
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,450
definitely want to look into it you can

763
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,600
put your I SEOs if you like right on top

764
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:21,760
of that instead of using aetherium and

765
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,469
finally my last slide I don't really

766
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,300
have time to get into all of them I

767
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,500
don't have a problem with our three or

768
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,950
hypo ledger because they don't have any

769
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,140
tokens they're just databases Ripple I

770
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,720
have a giant problem with we didn't get

771
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:37,300
to aetherium but I have three episodes

772
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,610
of crypto scam on aetherium just Google

773
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:43,810
crypto scam on my YouTube channel and

774
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:47,110
you will find those we can talk about

775
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:48,428
aetherium all day great tweet by Giacomo

776
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,459
Zuko Bitcoin

777
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:55,059
maximalism also known as moderate common

778
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:57,100
sense where bitcoin could succeed maybe

779
00:33:55,059 --> 00:34:00,519
could succeed is in the middle of the

780
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:04,539
spectrum the other two extremes are you

781
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:06,700
have Bitcoin cannot exist at all

782
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:09,879
that's your no coiner like Nouriel

783
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,699
Roubini or the multi corner extreme

784
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:15,219
where bitcoin is infinitely replicatable

785
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:17,319
and my clone is the best this is your

786
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:21,699
vitalik deuteron or anyone else that has

787
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:24,579
ever created an altcoin I think I'm good

788
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,439
I have some time for questions if the

789
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:28,179
Tyrian question comes up you know I'll

790
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,760
just mention it real quick to me

791
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:34,089
etherium has four critical problems

792
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,129
though one of them because of the EOS

793
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:38,349
because of the SEC not caring about

794
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:40,868
iOS's existence the first problem of

795
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:43,300
etherium is actually gonna go away but

796
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:45,579
from the beginning from day one I said

797
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,440
that aetherium is an unlicensed

798
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:50,919
unregistered security in multiple

799
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,200
violations of financial laws and I

800
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:54,730
expected the SEC and other regulators to

801
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,319
do something about it because they could

802
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,630
because it's centralized but they didn't

803
00:34:56,319 --> 00:35:01,180
and now probably not gonna do it at all

804
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:04,990
but I always felt that that aetherium

805
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:07,180
was a regulation risk if they declare

806
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,890
the security is basically screwed and

807
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,618
you can't trade it on all these

808
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,089
decentralized exchanges its second

809
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:16,869
problem is of course technological

810
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:18,790
aetherium just can't scale if you don't

811
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:23,589
believe me try to download an aetherium

812
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:25,359
full node good luck and the number of

813
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:28,058
nodes will just go down and down and

814
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,779
down the other problem is of course

815
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:35,290
economic in that you're not you don't

816
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:38,380
need to you shouldn't accept the stock

817
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:40,930
of your project as the currency of your

818
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,599
project so if you ever used Amazon

819
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:46,480
imagine if the currency on Amazon was

820
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,400
Amazon stock that fluctuates every

821
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,290
minute of every day that makes no sense

822
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
at all if you want to execute your smart

823
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,500
contract should be able to pay in

824
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,359
whatever currency you liked it should be

825
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,450
independent things so there's a huge

826
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,799
economic problem because smart contracts

827
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,989
on liquid side chain will will be

828
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:06,449
at least denominated in Bitcoin which

829
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:11,880
they need and the final problem with the

830
00:36:06,449 --> 00:36:14,729
theory 'm is conceptual decentralization

831
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,150
is very very costly this is why bitcoin

832
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:20,698
mining is so expensive and so energy

833
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:24,390
intensive decentralization needs to be

834
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:26,969
worth it and smart contracts a soda

835
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,969
machine is a smart contract put a put

836
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:32,219
your euro in get your soda out that's a

837
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:34,680
smart contract why does that need to be

838
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:35,999
decentralized it's using up an

839
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,618
unreasonable amount of resources for

840
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:39,718
something that's not necessary and if

841
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,690
you just work up the chain there's

842
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,759
almost nothing that requires

843
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:46,680
decentralization to prevent censorship

844
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:49,199
in a smart contract but at the end of

845
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,448
the day in a smart contract something or

846
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,430
someone has to do something in the

847
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:54,329
physical world and if it can be done in

848
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,910
the physical world

849
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:57,479
it cannot be decentralized it doesn't

850
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,549
work that way

851
00:36:57,479 --> 00:37:01,890
alright guys that's the presentation I

852
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:03,420
have time for questions thank you so

853
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:13,558
much and thank you for coming in

854
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:15,089
attending Hey

855
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:17,489
so have you ever thought about the

856
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:20,788
philosophical aspect of coins so

857
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:22,079
like I mean if you think about it every

858
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:23,489
 coin is basically just the

859
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,279
productivity inherent human greed

860
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:27,989
because you know Bitcoin is completely

861
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:29,989
unique as how it had started and

862
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:32,130
everything else is just created out of

863
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:34,049
human needs for more and more money

864
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,910
because you know if you take a look at

865
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:39,359
first and mozuku he's desponding his own

866
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:41,640
work yeah if you look at Charlie Lee

867
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,650
he's also doing it to make more money

868
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,279
and to make a living because he want to

869
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,440
live the good life

870
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:47,999
Zuka said that he he doesn't have to

871
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,319
worry anymore about going into the

872
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:52,468
shopping mall and then buying expensive

873
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:54,329
goods you get what I'm saying well yeah

874
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:56,400
but that's pretty much what I said as

875
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:58,229
well now I will give Charlie Lee a

876
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,920
little bit of slack I mean back when he

877
00:37:58,229 --> 00:38:04,288
created litecoin it was like the concept

878
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,690
of creating Bitcoin alternatives was

879
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:09,390
actually like new and interesting at the

880
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,430
time the fact that you could but a time

881
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,529
Zucco came around it was obvious that

882
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:16,190
this was an owl right

883
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:21,359
but back when Charlie Lee was doing it

884
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:23,760
that was it was better at that time so I

885
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,859
don't really about manage heartily for

886
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,869
doing it back then anybody could have

887
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:30,089
done that ripple is different they just

888
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:31,770
created up Billy a hundred billion

889
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:34,859
tokens from the Stars there was no

890
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:36,180
mining there was nothing but yeah but

891
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:38,790
that's exactly what's happening and

892
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,990
eventually people will you know stop

893
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:43,349
they're not gonna buy into this nonsense

894
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:47,098
right just the way that no one is buying

895
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:48,900
up dot-coms because it's a dot-com like

896
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,830
now people are like well what company is

897
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,160
if what do they do

898
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:55,080
went back in in the 90s you know you

899
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,299
slap a dot-com on it and all of a sudden

900
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,339
you have a profitable company and today

901
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,710
we all have a website it doesn't mean

902
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:03,930
that someone's gonna invest money in

903
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,220
your website so eventually the same

904
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:07,410
thing is going to happen here no one is

905
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,750
gonna invest in these things unless

906
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:12,359
there is actually clients and customers

907
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:14,280
in a profitable business and creating

908
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,200
your own currency is not a profitable

909
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:26,599
business its profitable for you it's not

910
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:29,609
profitable for anybody else either

911
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:31,560
thanks for the talk first of all I'd

912
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:34,020
like to suggest the correction to the

913
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,060
beginning of your presentation because

914
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,670
you claimed they were fixing the Powell

915
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:41,250
proof-of-work problem which they weren't

916
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:44,880
at all power already existed they were

917
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,230
fixing the but Byzantine general yeah I

918
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,060
meant they were fixing the double

919
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,369
spending problem with little work that's

920
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,290
what I which you claim that blockchain

921
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:54,300
was not instrumental for that and it was

922
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,880
because you needed a decentralized

923
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,490
ledger where everyone could agree for

924
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,070
for that problem to be fixed so it was

925
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:04,319
not Paul no it was not proof of work

926
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:06,119
which was fixed it was the Byzantine

927
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,190
consensus all right but the war

928
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:10,290
blockchain like everyone has their own

929
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,830
definition of blockchain my definition

930
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:15,990
of blockchain is proof of work okay

931
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:18,180
it's yours I'll I'll take it as it is

932
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:20,549
regarding some other stuff of your

933
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,830
presentation I deeply disagree with

934
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,349
several things that you mentioned first

935
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,810
of all your suggestion for privacy

936
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:29,090
you're suggesting to a

937
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:30,740
everyone to use a solution that first of

938
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,330
all is not trustless and you are

939
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,370
presenting it Stressless and there's a

940
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:37,100
great improvement over centralized

941
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:40,370
solutions like marketplaces and liquid

942
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:42,259
is not a decentralized solution so

943
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:46,370
that's that's that's I think should

944
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:49,160
concern but but my view of liquid was

945
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:52,460
moving your Bitcoin into liquid and then

946
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:56,660
moving it back out into Bitcoin which is

947
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:58,690
a lot more trust less than moving your

948
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,819
Bitcoin through a centralized exchange

949
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:04,630
into Manero and moving it back into

950
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:07,220
Bitcoin through the centralized exchange

951
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:11,900
you you don't need necessarily to move

952
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:13,730
it into Bitcoin at any point since that

953
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:19,610
you have also a great confidence on the

954
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:20,930
future of Bitcoin privacy I like to ask

955
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,760
you if you're willing and I know that

956
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:25,430
you're an older and I I do appreciate

957
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,290
your your show i watch it a lot I know

958
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,580
that you're older I would like to ask

959
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,950
you if you are willing to change your

960
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:33,259
Bitcoin for the most Tainted coins that

961
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:35,029
anyone in this room have would you be

962
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,400
willing to do that with a confident on

963
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:41,510
the privacy future techniques that you

964
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:44,630
claim Bitcoin will have I actually would

965
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:47,660
as long as it's not publicly known that

966
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,320
I did it okay so I wouldn't do it on

967
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,839
camera

968
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,580
and as long as I know that that person

969
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:56,720
won't take a bit like as long as that

970
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:59,029
transaction is not like public by

971
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,609
someone else in the room and I would not

972
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:05,720
mind okay and just just a final question

973
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:07,850
sorry you talked you you mentioned the

974
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,040
fifteen-year-old kids on the beginning

975
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:12,140
of your presentation and also that taps

976
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,509
into the artists money that you

977
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,580
mentioned that bitcoin is and the

978
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:19,100
security proposition of that Bitcoin has

979
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:22,160
are that fifteen-year-old kid that you

980
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:25,520
cited in the beginning as several doubt

981
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,490
that security model of Bitcoin as is

982
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:34,670
with the current emission rate will

983
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:37,129
sustain the security after 21:40 yeah so

984
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,240
I can comment on that also just on the

985
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:42,390
tainted Bitcoin thing

986
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:45,089
addition to that statement I would have

987
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:47,759
to not know in advance like if someone

988
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:48,990
told me that hey this is tainted then I

989
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,119
wouldn't do the transaction because

990
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:52,799
again I don't know that person but if

991
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,210
the Bitcoin is coming in I don't know

992
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,880
where it's coming from

993
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:58,349
but if someone tells me that this

994
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,220
Bitcoin was used in an illicit

995
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:02,130
transaction

996
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:04,109
I would then not take it because then I

997
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,820
know that it that it's actually tainted

998
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:09,810
the point is that you're not supposed to

999
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:14,430
know the bigger problem with using

1000
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:19,230
something like Manero is that it will

1001
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:21,540
not have a store value so it's okay to

1002
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:24,930
use it in transactions if you need the

1003
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:28,109
privacy but if no one is willing to hold

1004
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:29,359
it for a longer period of time it kind

1005
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:32,369
of becomes like a hot potato

1006
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,848
this is what the B cache people haven't

1007
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:37,650
figured out and basically why their

1008
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:39,300
currency continues to drop because that

1009
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:42,599
currency is for spending and not for

1010
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:45,859
saving so for example I think the

1011
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:50,880
currency right now in the world that is

1012
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:53,250
most use used for transactions it's

1013
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,560
probably the Venezuelan Bulevar because

1014
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:58,020
the moment you acquired the Venezuelan

1015
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,880
Bulevar you are trying to spend it as

1016
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,160
soon as possible because if you don't

1017
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,859
spend it immediately it will do nothing

1018
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,770
but lose value okay and this is the

1019
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:10,410
problem with something like Manero is

1020
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:13,740
that if you hold on to it for any length

1021
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:15,899
of time it's going to lose value so the

1022
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:19,109
moment you acquire it you need to

1023
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:21,180
immediately suspend it and that's the

1024
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:25,319
and that's one of the problems because

1025
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:29,399
it just it will not be something to

1026
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:31,770
store your wealth in and and I'll admit

1027
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,720
Manero is more private than Bitcoin but

1028
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:38,009
bitcoins privacy will be more than

1029
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,618
sufficient for and it will be fungible

1030
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:42,599
it just needs a little more time because

1031
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:46,320
things are an instant to talk about

1032
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:48,660
mining incentives in the year 2140 I

1033
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,869
mean I'm not gonna be alive I have no

1034
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,500
idea I'm trying to be still be alive in

1035
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:57,000
2004

1036
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:58,349
but the odds are not with me and so

1037
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,540
what's gonna happen 10 that's a common

1038
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:06,480
question what happens to Bitcoin when

1039
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:08,040
mining reward is is no more and there's

1040
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,470
a couple of things here so first of all

1041
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,109
like I said earlier as long as Bitcoin

1042
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:15,720
doubles in price every 4 years that's

1043
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:18,480
not an issue then people will still mine

1044
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,730
at today's hash rate the hash rate just

1045
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,550
probably won't increase I believe that

1046
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:27,680
Bitcoin can do better than doubling in

1047
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:31,290
price every four years now my

1048
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,549
transaction fees should be able to pick

1049
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:35,790
up the slack as more and more people

1050
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:38,490
start to use Bitcoin so transaction fees

1051
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:40,800
is the common way to answer the question

1052
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:44,009
as to what would be the mining incentive

1053
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,520
in the future I have another answer I

1054
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:50,220
believe that even if the mining fees are

1055
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,540
not sufficient people will still mind

1056
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:58,919
people will mine at a loss for example

1057
00:45:53,540 --> 00:46:02,220
do you earn money directly from paying

1058
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,050
for your internet and the answer is no

1059
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,450
right the internet is not monetized the

1060
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:10,589
way Bitcoin is monetized so why are you

1061
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:13,950
willing to lose money every year every

1062
00:46:10,589 --> 00:46:15,299
month on paying an internet bill and the

1063
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,460
answer is because your life will really

1064
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:21,150
really suck if you did not have internet

1065
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:23,940
and and for most people you may not even

1066
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:26,720
have a job like the reason why people

1067
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:29,820
are investing in Internet infrastructure

1068
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,490
still today and the reason why you pay

1069
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:34,890
an Internet bill is because the internet

1070
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:38,279
brings you more value than the bill that

1071
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:40,920
you pay so what happens when you want to

1072
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,470
protect your savings you want to protect

1073
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,290
your on confiscate able savings what

1074
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:48,598
happens when a business is earning a

1075
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:51,509
billion dollars a year because of

1076
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:54,359
bitcoins existence how much money do you

1077
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:57,450
think they'll be willing to spend mining

1078
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:59,369
at a loss I think it's easy 200 million

1079
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,490
300 million they get to keep the other

1080
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:05,580
700 million just buy bitcoins existence

1081
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:06,180
I think there will be enough mining out

1082
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,120
there

1083
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:15,270
at a loss to protect the system because

1084
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:16,920
the system helps you I'm sorry we don't

1085
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:20,400
have more time for questions but you can

1086
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:23,600
catch him after no and thank you for

1087
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,600
coming all right thank you

1088
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,670
you
