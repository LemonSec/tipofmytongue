good afternoon I would like to introduce

4
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:39,620
Michelle posnansky he's an architect

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:43,010
living working in Florida according to

6
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,739
his bio and he's going to talk about a

7
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:51,430
concept of opt out in relationship to

8
00:00:45,739 --> 00:01:00,589
the cities of the future so welcome

9
00:00:51,430 --> 00:01:01,490
thank you before I start to talk I would

10
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:07,040

trust that I will know what I am talking

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,910
about because it's a differently theme

14
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:20,810
or topic which you are not talking every

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:23,229
day about so just small intro about

16
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,899
myself I'm an architect

17
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:29,390
yes I am a living class 19 years 19

18
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:34,130
years in United States recently in

19
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:39,020
Florida just this is my biggest project

20
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:43,220
I ever did in my life building here you

21
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,649
can see here it was quite interesting

22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,830
experience now I'm coming back and

23
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:51,680
forward last three years I am

24
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:54,439
collaborating with Czech Institute of

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,840
Informatics robotica cybernetic here in

26
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:01,490
Prague on Park six with Professor magic

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:04,010
and I he gave me opportunity to open a

28
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:08,179
city of the center of the city of the

29
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:11,330
future which means we are bringing

30
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:14,269
partners together it's an academic

31
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,910
partner platform natural politically

32
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:19,880
neutral we don't care with who

33
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:23,240
and it is actually natural platform also

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:27,890
to ours vendors so yeah we have vendors

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:30,230
from of course from commercial side from

36
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,190
business but you also have a lot of

37
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:36,230
municipalities and we have a lot of

38
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,630
academics working with us so we are

39
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,090
trying to connect it together and one of

40
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:48,019
our teams of our topic we are talking

41
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:51,560
about is also a distributed services

42
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:54,530
sharing shared services and then so on

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,290
and we are talking about how we should

44
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,960
organize the city of the future so when

45
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:04,070
I am talking about cities of the future

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:08,260
I'm always looking at to the Past how

47
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:13,760
our predecessors only saw our future and

48
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:16,420
maybe some there will be some things we

49
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,010
could they saw very precisely this is

50
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:24,079
you can see this picture is showing

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:28,370
cities growing up to do high vertical

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:32,210
cities they expected to use a lot of

53
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:36,400
planes in today what we are talking

54
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:40,220
about drones and and using some kind of

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,820
transportation through the air and I

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,070
like this picture because it it says

57
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,790
something about micro mobility we are

58
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:53,329
trying to solve today and it's very it's

59
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:55,790
very important term in topic again for

60
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:00,580
today's cities because we are trying up

61
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:03,859
to out the transportation using cars

62
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:07,490
inside the cities inside the downtown's

63
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:11,240
and we are talking a lot about micro

64
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:14,959
mobility but as you can see today cities

65
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:18,799
have a problem is all those bikes and

66
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:22,010
they actually their reactions always are

67
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:25,159
always the first reactions ok we will

68
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,039
say they cannot operate here this is the

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,690
easiest way but what is the real

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,350
opportunity for the future how we can

71
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,920
really observe

72
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:39,440
from those from those vehicles where you

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:42,530
have one one person on you know 2x3 so

74
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,400
it's a on 6 square meters going going

75
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:50,239
through the car tongue my butt is but

76
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,130
what this picture also says so that's my

77
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,200
question how it's gonna look in the

78
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,950
future if you will allow everybody to

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,349
use something like this some kind of

80
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:06,920
miracle maker ability making up micro

81
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:09,590
mobility transportation vehicle and what

82
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,020
if it will be autonomous so you don't

83
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,659
even have to do anything just it will go

84
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,690
anywhere view say it will go and so it

85
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,850
will be accessible for everybody so what

86
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,130
may happen is the street will be full of

87
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:26,150
that I mean the city will be full of

88
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:29,750
this all those robotic early automate it

89
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:33,200
out on or mostly driverless vehicles

90
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,560
what's gonna happen next this is

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:40,280
interesting picture those two pictures

92
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,430
are actually those renderings were done

93
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,919
by the company which is called Otis or

94
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,410
this is elevator company lifts they do

95
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,120
they do list till today even in my

96
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:53,960
building we have actually wrote this or

97
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,330
there but how days it's what is

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,080
interesting how they saw the future in

99
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:05,469
the past so they hope that we will be we

100
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:09,530
will have we will separate all those on

101
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:12,350
fast vehicles and I'm so slow going

102
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:17,900
vehicles and and pedestrians and we will

103
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:18,380
have nice green yes in on the floor of

104
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,620
the city

105
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:27,050
open open city space and it didn't

106
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,250
happen of course we are still you are

107
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,860
still you know in one space and we will

108
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,740
have to find some solution we we will

109
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,690
really have to find what to do for the

110
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,279
future because that space is more and

111
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,319
more crowded

112
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,779
people are the last one who are actually

113
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,269
allowed to that do that space because

114
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,399
there are all those vehicles there so

115
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:52,789
what are we gonna do in the next and I

116
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:56,109
always say I believe we will again with

117
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:59,899
it autonomous drivers cars and other

118
00:06:56,109 --> 00:07:03,019
things I believe we will have to really

119
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:06,469
find out how to change the whole space

120
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:10,699
in the city that all and I'm talking

121
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:12,979
about new authorization of cities Osman

122
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:18,110
Ozma's Asian postman was architect who

123
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:20,419
changed parties from 1853 to 1870 it may

124
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,219
happen again in our features differently

125
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:25,339
of course I'm not saying we will we will

126
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:28,639
go and we will take down knocked out of

127
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:33,459
our beautiful cities mosque is not the

128
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:37,519
first one who is doing hip roof a loop

129
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:40,309
there wasn't so many ideas before but

130
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:44,749
again if I am talking it's we are trying

131
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:49,669
to free the land and move everything

132
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:52,939
somewhere else but I don't know is it

133
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:59,869
really opportunity for our account three

134
00:07:52,939 --> 00:08:02,839
because you know are they d1 equal it

135
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:05,749
highway but really small parking space

136
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:09,349
for the cars between plaque and a bird

137
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:13,579
no so it is it are we really able to do

138
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:15,519
that it's very interesting this is very

139
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:20,659
interesting picture for to me they

140
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:24,439
always heard about a moving sidewalks I

141
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:26,329
never know what they mean I also always

142
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,929
meant that its sidewall which will be

143
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:32,089
moving but this is what actually was the

144
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:34,688
their imagination their vision of the

145
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,459
moving sidewalk and is this an

146
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:39,860
opportunity we can use for our cities I

147
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:42,289
don't know probably not not maybe

148
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,990
somebody in some theme park or somewhere

149
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:49,130
else but again

150
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:52,589
they were they were trying to solve some

151
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,300
somehow the future transportation inside

152
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:57,750
the cities and you see the same here

153
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,819
again couple of levels so but the

154
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,910
problem is it's very expensive and we

155
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:04,130
just don't have technology to do it we

156
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,589
do have technology but we don't have

157
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:11,610
like opportunity to do it in our city

158
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:14,579
and so if you go of course if you go to

159
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,500
Los Angeles or Sowers you can see many

160
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:21,029
layers of intersections and then

161
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:25,470
highways but even there it's problem but

162
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:27,420
this is our we not mine but I just took

163
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:31,050
it from internet versus some of visions

164
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:34,620
of the city of the future today so they

165
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:38,758
are doing is we are we are moving from

166
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,220
the from the country from villages

167
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,630
everybody is moving in to the city not

168
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,790
I'm not saying everybody that many

169
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,550
people is moving into the city space and

170
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:50,790
we have to go higher we have a lot of

171
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,500
regulations today coming from master

172
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,079
plan but saying we cannot go

173
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,459
specifically prac we cannot go higher

174
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:01,769
more than a 150 meters and so on and so

175
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:03,719
on I think we have to do we have to go

176
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,990
much higher and buildings will be much

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:11,569
bigger because all that climate change

178
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:14,339
issue and other things so we will try to

179
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:19,130
probably in the future accommodate more

180
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:22,790
functions in bigger bigger structures

181
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:26,459
but we will see what's gonna happen next

182
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:30,410
this is one of other interesting

183
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:33,979
pictures of the future city you know

184
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:36,870
these guys with its famous french guy

185
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,779
architect who is doing all kind of these

186
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,699
renderings and we are trying to move he

187
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:45,600
saying we are we will go to move we will

188
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:49,229
go and move to to the ocean and we are

189
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,889
trying to basically occupy other

190
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,889
unoccupied

191
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:59,290
because cities will have to probably if

192
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,430
they if the true is that ocean will

193
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,740
raise up couple meters maybe in the

194
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,699
future there's a lot of cities on the

195
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,790
coast and they will have to move

196
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:13,750
somewhere so and this is a this is the

197
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:15,640
version of city on the ocean actually so

198
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,700
this is our ability where we are right

199
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,990
now we are connecting everything we are

200
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:27,330
we do really have a lot of technology we

201
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:34,180
can talk to each other across the ocean

202
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:36,880
I am my work 70% of my work is done over

203
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,609
the Internet

204
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,660
I'm using of course whatsapp it was

205
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:47,520
Skyped before or other different

206
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:51,699
communication tool so I can really reach

207
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,069
and manage many things in one time one

208
00:11:51,700 --> 00:12:00,940
of one of things we are also doing right

209
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:02,950
now is working with health the health

210
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,050
about guys from Health Department and

211
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:09,790
from other affirm that in the health

212
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:13,479
industry and we are working on tulare

213
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:19,810
habilitation we build up one unit which

214
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:22,480
will be introduced next week for one

215
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,310
fireman who injured he is not able to

216
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,380
move too much but now we will be

217
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:31,989
rehabilitating and this foundation which

218
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:36,990
was called Reggie base we just prepare

219
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:40,030
this this unit it's like container

220
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:43,510
solution and we brought it to his house

221
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:47,560
so he doesn't have to go every day to do

222
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,700
to to exercise and rehabilitate so we

223
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,160
brought it to him

224
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,200
and now we are this is not a picture of

225
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,779
course but we are connected

226
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,040
men who is rehabilitating a woman who is

227
00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:04,120
about rehabilitating with him who is

228
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:07,540
using just very simple things and then

229
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:11,070
they have face-to-face contact she can

230
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,990
she can arrest him or he can always

231
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,779
control him if push poster and then

232
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,850
everything is right if we do things

233
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:21,670
right so we have a huge opportunity to

234
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,440
talk to each other and do finding we can

235
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,899
find new type of businesses but you can

236
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,130
also find new type of services and very

237
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:33,930
how to do things but this is right now

238
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:36,189
big for many cities around the world and

239
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,899
sometimes I think that we don't talk

240
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,760
about anything else

241
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:46,480
then about smart so-called smart cities

242
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:49,420
you call it smart cities 0:07 as aj want

243
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,019
you know he has all those tools and then

244
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,060
I'm kind of I also wrote of course

245
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:59,949
couple articles about smart cities but I

246
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:07,510
didn't expect it will grow to this this

247
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:10,300
I would say and I would call it nicely

248
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,370
but to this situation that everybody

249
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,589
says talks about smart city and that

250
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,060
it's everything but you can you can talk

251
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:19,300
about everything it's always smart city

252
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:22,630
so what true is we are implementing

253
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,660
technology in two ns and I think what we

254
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:29,519
what we can so it's smart energy

255
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,519
networking smart meter and compute

256
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:36,279
automotive industry medical I was

257
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,760
talking about that all industry which is

258
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:42,010
using a different team which is called

259
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,670
our name for them it's called industry

260
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,589
4.0 it's basically on the same they have

261
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,819
the same principles everything is

262
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:50,639
connected to everything there's a

263
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:54,040
vertical I mean vertical and horizontal

264
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,949
connection correction human to robot

265
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,920
robot to human we will see further what

266
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:02,560
I'm what I am meaning by that and and

267
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,110
the trace it's helpful of course we are

268
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,119
we know how to organize things better we

269
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,720
know we we can

270
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,879
a lot of data so I can have better

271
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,649
knowledge about existing cities use it

272
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:20,279
using beam building information

273
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:23,189
management tools and software so I can

274
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:27,029
build our own project new cities or new

275
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:30,329
buildings through those tools I can

276
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:34,649
share everything with everybody on the

277
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:38,160
team which is very very good but a true

278
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:42,120
is that when I started I had draw areas

279
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,399
I had to draw everything by hand and my

280
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,709
brain was working with my hand

281
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,069
it was very quick it is very quick

282
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:52,998
connection but we are losing this scale

283
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:56,128
and sometimes we are focusing only on

284
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:57,720
shape of the building and anivia and now

285
00:15:56,129 --> 00:16:00,930
everything will be connected in insight

286
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,879
that we are losing knowledge about how

287
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,189
it should be organized inside so it

288
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,339
works for the people the same as with

289
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:14,998
the city I'm that chair the building

290
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:18,720
where I am right now Prague 6 is it's

291
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:21,720
actually the building 1 some price for

292
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,509
architecture but it's very difficult for

293
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,360
us to live inside that building they

294
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:32,870
call it smart building but it's not

295
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,350
really smart because you know always the

296
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,920
how do you call it

297
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:40,980
Rolla t-shirts are always moving up and

298
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:45,059
down how they want you know you want to

299
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:48,779
you want you don't there's no there's

300
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:52,759
not either one switcher so you know you

301
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:57,420
cannot switch on and off simplify your

302
00:16:52,759 --> 00:17:01,079
your light everything is controlled by

303
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,839
something it doesn't work always very

304
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:08,220
but I have a I have a I have space like

305
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:12,270
this and above me is a kitchen and when

306
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,860
they end the day work I can hear

307
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,990
everything going out because now

308
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,658
whatever thinking about how to insulate

309
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,650
everything so technically it's very

310
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:21,600
smart building

311
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,930
but my guests things they are sitting

312
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,270
under the toilets and there's thousand

313
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,700
people coming in one side and putting

314
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,800
all their what they have inside

315
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,680
themselves they put in one time so it's

316
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,800
so we are losing sometimes that that

317
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,480
knowledge to the technology because that

318
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:45,180
so I think there's this there should be

319
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,980
some I believe there should be some you

320
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,950
should focus more on our skills own

321
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:53,040
skills as a people not about what we can

322
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:55,170
do only with technology this is what is

323
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:00,750
of course you know this better than me

324
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:02,270
probably this is about IOT everything

325
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,770
will be connected to everything

326
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:09,809
everything will be talking to everything

327
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:14,210
so and we can use it for any type of

328
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:17,428
Industry and any type of things we have

329
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:21,020
beaver on ourself so we will of course

330
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:25,320
be also monitor we are always already

331
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:29,580
monitor big brother knows everything

332
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:32,178
about us how we can avoid it I don't

333
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:35,428
know I don't think there's even

334
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:40,170
possibility to be there's no possibility

335
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:42,750
to be watched 24/7 and we are relying

336
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,000
more and more on the technology even are

337
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,370
those variables I don't have any right

338
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,660
now I am phone and technically

339
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,949
everything what we are talking here

340
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:54,420
about can hear somebody else and it

341
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:59,160
could be used against me if I say

342
00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:04,700
something maybe in the future so what is

343
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:10,380
the what is the reality check is this

344
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:12,059
this picture to me is showing what so we

345
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,250
have some kind of opportunity that's

346
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:17,610
what we are right today what we are now

347
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:20,910
today see nobody talks to anybody

348
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:26,770
almost I mean maybe you have different

349
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:32,490
experience but if you go to metro or

350
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:35,590
if you used rum or some whatever

351
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:38,950
transportation service how do you see is

352
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:42,280
people watching - to their mobile phones

353
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,020
or computers or something careless and

354
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,980
and they almost don't connect to each

355
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:52,240
other you can go to small kids are you

356
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,200
know sent in sent box are just playing

357
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,190
quiz please

358
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,520
so so this is where you are right now

359
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:03,820
and again I'm using those two pictures

360
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,700
this is what you're really we are

361
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,870
creating right now what is happening

362
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:12,430
slowly but this is really happening

363
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:18,010
you are younger much younger than I am

364
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:21,610
but I don't think we really want this we

365
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:27,100
have to be able to have an opportunity

366
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:30,100
to not be connected 24/7 to technologies

367
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,639
and we have to survive it out there this

368
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:36,580
picture is from 54 if I am right 1950 it

369
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:41,290
was it was issued this this magazine at

370
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:45,399
1954 it basically shows what's gonna

371
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:48,570
what may happen in the future so robots

372
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,510
are revolting against people again human

373
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:56,050
humans because we in the future we will

374
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:57,580
be talking about robots rights how they

375
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:01,659
we will collaborate to each other how we

376
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:03,909
coexist to eat to each other and what I

377
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,610
did is I have four friends of mine who

378
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,620
was writing some book about future

379
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:13,840
cities so I did a couple of illustration

380
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:16,750
so before I go if I talk about options

381
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,659
on the opt-out for small cities I'll

382
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,700
show you what I think this about the

383
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,870
future city about the future people

384
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:28,900
because cities are really mayor of their

385
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,729
users peoples are they don't exist if

386
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,950
they don't have they don't exist if they

387
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,960
don't have users till now of course in

388
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,930
the future we may have some autonomous

389
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,070
automatic automatization ultimate data

390
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,860
cities

391
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,300
but let's don't talk about those those

392
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,610
are structures they can operate without

393
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,889
humans in the future we already have

394
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:53,020
Downers some structures like that but

395
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:56,560
they are more industrial structures then

396
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,600
then cities so what we are doing right

397
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,620
now we are creating I call it roboticus

398
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:06,790
or more roboticus for alternation to

399
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:11,139
Homo sapiens and we rely on two that we

400
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:12,670
believe it's actually great idea but of

401
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,950
course it's it's it's not going to

402
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,380
happen from one day to other day from

403
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,300
day to day it will go slowly now we are

404
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,060
able to put a lot of additions to our

405
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,919
body and we are trying to put yeah we

406
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:30,010
are able to put a lot of sensors in our

407
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:32,770
bodies alternate some kinds of parts of

408
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:37,210
our bodies all that we know what we have

409
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:38,920
technology now a lot of technology but

410
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,590
the problem is that for example in

411
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:45,820
United States where I live you have a

412
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:48,909
huge problem is people who are who rely

413
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:53,500
and live on drugs and don't mean I mean

414
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:57,100
drugs as a no heroine I mean the normal

415
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:00,010
drugs prescription prescription drugs

416
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:03,629
from the from medical drugs and then

417
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:06,760
there's no or they will focus on their

418
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:10,300
on their

419
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,610
psychic side and then you see there's a

420
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,760
lot of shooting and it's a lot of mass

421
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,679
you think I mean which is of course

422
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,780
popularized well that's why everybody

423
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,850
hit about America in America every

424
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,170
shooting to everybody it looks like but

425
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,179
there are mass shootings and those

426
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,490
people are mostly crazy it's not about

427
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:31,230
the guns it's about those people who are

428
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:36,310
really getting crazy that's very very

429
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:39,310
sad yeah we are able to right now we

430
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:44,320
will be talking a lot about human to

431
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:46,210
robot collaboration this is our field

432
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,399
this is our real future which is coming

433
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,380
right now it doesn't have to be rabat

434
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,760
like this but it can be just it can be

435
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,150
just software it still

436
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,820
it's all powered by AI you know or they

437
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:01,070
probably know more than me about AI but

438
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:05,629
this is where where we are looking right

439
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:08,899
now we're going there's a lot of even in

440
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:11,750
recent days nowadays is we are talking

441
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:15,980
about partnership but between human and

442
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:19,840
between a robot some of some of older

443
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:22,420
people for example they are using toys

444
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,980
which are looking very very

445
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:30,230
realistically very see more like like

446
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:33,590
look they look like small doggies or

447
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:37,310
some kind of pets and they really help

448
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:42,110
those old people they help them to not

449
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:44,690
be alone so they can survive their days

450
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:47,000
and they have some partner to talk to it

451
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,490
so I believe it's very important to have

452
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:57,380
friends and maybe our friends will be

453
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:59,060
more robotic Holly I poverty things but

454
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,780
what we really need to do is in the

455
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,270
future

456
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,520
we have to build a infrastructure

457
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:08,200
technical infrastructure for all those

458
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:11,180
new guys which are around us and

459
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,180
everyone everybody says okay we've in

460
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:16,810
five years we can drive everybody in

461
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,190
autonomous cars drive driverless cars

462
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:22,010
and it will help us a lot

463
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,710
it's not really true we will find couple

464
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:28,850
drivers cars which will be able to drive

465
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:31,730
through the through the cities but not

466
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,169
all of them because for all of them we

467
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,710
need completely different

468
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:41,240
infrastructures and we have today and we

469
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:46,280
will be relying a lot on things like 5g

470
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:49,550
technology which has to be spirit all

471
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,910
those beacons has to be spread around us

472
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:55,700
in the town so signal is not in a week

473
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,210
somewhere so it in function the proper

474
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,930
way

475
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:03,240
and it will taken many many years so yes

476
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:08,400
there well there will be some autonomous

477
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:11,220
Drive nice cars and but I believe much

478
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,240
sooner they may be a lot of different

479
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:18,210
things around us a lot of I'm not saying

480
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,930
that was looking Fridays but normal

481
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:24,900
small things which will be running

482
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:29,270
around you and you don't we will not

483
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:34,380
know what is their function for but

484
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:37,379
there may be even more more robots like

485
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,480
that more than people on those streets

486
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,340
and this is the future we have to count

487
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,130
on because it's going to happen right

488
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:48,570
now I think it was in Atlanta they were

489
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:55,280
solving a problem if small robots is

490
00:26:48,570 --> 00:27:00,120
which is varying pizza to his client

491
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:02,070
with I can end it immediately just let

492
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,570
me tell me how long you want me to talk

493
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:12,179
and I had so the pizza is going through

494
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:15,020
town crossing the crosswalk now who is

495
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:19,680
the right of the way on the crosswalk

496
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:21,180
Pizza Pizza robot or car or no it's you

497
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,950
would say it's normal it's it's simple

498
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:27,510
solution of bits are about has a why in

499
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,580
the future they will have to communicate

500
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:32,190
we in the future we may not have even

501
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:35,580
some crosswalks because why we should

502
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:37,710
never even have crosswalk if my body is

503
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:41,189
through some tools or America is

504
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:43,640
communicating with all those cars this

505
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,440
will be one mesh network somehow

506
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,270
connected together information from me

507
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,280
will be about me will be emitted or

508
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,530
somewhere else but how we what if I

509
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,899
don't want anybody to have information

510
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:57,090
about me moving through the town

511
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,500
it's cafe it's something where we have

512
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,649
to really find out how to solve this

513
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:06,150
problem how you can opt out from those

514
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:08,040
technical you know divert when everybody

515
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:11,020
knows everything about myself and they

516
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:15,970
can use this information

517
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:19,940
this is just picture I was trying to

518
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:22,850
talk about we talk about gender a lot

519
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,680
here - no I'm not I don't know if here

520
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,199
but in u.s. there's a lot of about

521
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,030
there's a woman there's a man and

522
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,170
there's some couple I don't know how

523
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:37,190
many too many genders also they are able

524
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:39,970
to define but what we will be talking

525
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:43,610
about our new relation kind of

526
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:47,030
relationships between people and her

527
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:49,639
about robot - robot and even our

528
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:52,310
relationship you can see it you can it's

529
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:56,450
it's completely different it was many

530
00:28:52,310 --> 00:29:01,760
years ago so what you are creating

531
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:05,500
really to me how I it is I call it

532
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:12,080
cybernetic cybernetic digital twin so

533
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:15,470
for the future cities we are talking

534
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,010
about we are talking about digital twins

535
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:23,600
of cities so we will be able to

536
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:29,000
manipulate or function or turn off turn

537
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,740
on some functions in the city so we are

538
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,630
using technology to connect everything

539
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,300
to everything as I said we have sensors

540
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:37,820
in everything so we can control the

541
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,250
usage and so it's perfect

542
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,970
the problem is that if you centralize

543
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:46,430
this control it's extremely danger

544
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:48,860
because somebody can take over a control

545
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:51,140
over it so what I am working right now

546
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:58,149
and I'm proposing you have to find some

547
00:29:51,140 --> 00:30:03,920
I call it opt-out we have to find some

548
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:06,860
way how to not be dependent we don't

549
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,680
depend on big guys or big or companies

550
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:13,250
really owning the city because they want

551
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,820
they turn on the gas they turn of the

552
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:19,070
they could turn of gas or electricity

553
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,870
you have no opportunity to then

554
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,510
to do what they say you have to pay them

555
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:25,610
whatever whatever they say so we are

556
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:29,629
working on I call it of a great solution

557
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:32,629
or Island solution and we are focusing

558
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,980
with with my with my group and at center

559
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:38,420
of the city future we are really

560
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:41,720
focusing on those on solutions when you

561
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:44,150
can really opt out from those big big

562
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:48,620
companies and big technology guys and

563
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:52,970
have have your own solution for the

564
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:57,739
cities of size five hundred thousand

565
00:30:52,970 --> 00:31:02,300
five thousand people like which is half

566
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:08,350
of the population living actually in

567
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:12,169
Czech Republic in central bohemian

568
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:15,649
region which are there are our partners

569
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:19,310
in in our center there's about thousand

570
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:22,940
thousand small villages and cities

571
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:27,080
having about thousand people only it's a

572
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:31,160
lot of people living there and they rely

573
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,990
on those big guys because they bought

574
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,450
all the technology all that

575
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:37,970
infrastructure most of them in most

576
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:40,100
cities they own it so they cannot do

577
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:43,510
what they want you have to ask somebody

578
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:46,580
if you want to put your PV photovoltaic

579
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:49,040
unit you have to ask you cannot just do

580
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:55,010
it you cannot you cannot be supplier to

581
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:57,320
the to the electric grid even you make

582
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,930
it and we are talking about smart grid

583
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:03,139
so cause moderate when you are not only

584
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:06,950
user or you don't buy but you supply

585
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:09,650
back that electricity or you can so it

586
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:13,760
means you have you let's say we have

587
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:17,300
factory air if some we have network of

588
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,940
your Institute around around the Czech

589
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:24,590
Republic and world and you you should be

590
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:27,560
able to have to send your energy

591
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,050
you actually made on your property and

592
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,300
send it to somebody else

593
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:34,790
on the other side of the city which is

594
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,290
normal it should be normal but you

595
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,950
cannot do this not now because the big

596
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:43,340
guys gonna do it because we own that we

597
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:46,970
own that infrastructure so you sell it

598
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:49,370
to them for small money and they sell it

599
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,390
back to you for big money so it's it's

600
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,709
it's nonsense

601
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:56,990
so we are trying to find out how to

602
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:59,720
create of Ireland solutions or cities

603
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:02,570
for water specifically were for water

604
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,100
and electricity because if you don't

605
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,530
have water and electricity you cannot

606
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:09,500
survive basically and we are trying to

607
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,570
do it not on I'm not saying on always on

608
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:18,110
the property of the city but we are

609
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:20,179
trying to do that in subsonic okay okay

610
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,979
I have to start talking so I'm sorry I

611
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:25,330
can't tell you everything what I want

612
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:35,900
right it would be a couple of hours

613
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:40,909
thank you so much do you have any

614
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:43,460
question yes but I didn't talk about is

615
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:48,050
cryptocurrency and things I didn't talk

616
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:51,260
about distributed distributed system

617
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:55,129
even to use in the future to control our

618
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:57,879
politics and money so I'm sorry I I

619
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,880
forgot

620
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,010
thanks for the talk my question that I

621
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:10,040
have is in the past the reasons because

622
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:13,699
the the big cities started to grow was

623
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:16,820
because of centralization and mother but

624
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:19,279
now nowadays with internet we are

625
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:21,440
decentralized in a little bit I mean you

626
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,500
still have the factories but we don't

627
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,080
need these central monitoring centers

628
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,290
anymore so do you think that the cities

629
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,600
are still going to grow in the same

630
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:34,429
speed or more decentralization absurd

631
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,159
this is interesting question 20 years

632
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,200
ago before I moved out to United States

633
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,470
I was working for small city for kids

634
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,779
and the biggest issue was that people

635
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:46,120
are moving out from that's

636
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:49,419
City going out to the bigger cities I

637
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:52,089
call it I call it a gravitation power of

638
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:56,859
those of those big cities they just no

639
00:34:52,090 --> 00:35:00,840
no suck everything in 20 years later the

640
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:05,260
biggest issue for the future and is that

641
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:07,840
in about 2050 there will be 70 people

642
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:11,530
70% people living in big cities but

643
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,410
that's what they say what you answer in

644
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,000
in our region I don't think that

645
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:19,089
everybody would like to move to city

646
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,190
there's many people moving out I mean

647
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:24,220
internet started I mean not been started

648
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:27,430
but in my time 20 years attorney 24

649
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:31,750
years ago I actually I had an office in

650
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:33,940
Prague and I let my employees I told

651
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,350
mine I police one day I'm not gonna pay

652
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,050
for office is here for you because

653
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,910
you're just now playing games here and

654
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,230
if I'm not here I was traveling a lot

655
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,210
and I find out they are doing nothing

656
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:46,210
there but they are using actually my

657
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,540
office for doing their work so I said ah

658
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,520
ah

659
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,400
I'm shutting down office so I gave I

660
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,830
gave 2/3 of those employees I had about

661
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,650
15 but I say bye-bye I don't need you

662
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:59,080
more so I gave three of my employees

663
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:01,900
computer and I told them you work from

664
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:05,110
home and I moved from City from Prague I

665
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,820
moved 50 kilometres out I was in the

666
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,500
middle of the now nowhere the only

667
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,950
problem was that internet in that time

668
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:16,480
it was a modem working through T

669
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:19,089
telephone so half megabyte it was very

670
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,620
very slow and that our drawings are big

671
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,200
so it was a litte bit difficult but in

672
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:25,060
the future I'm talking so we have the

673
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,450
same problem saying people are leaving

674
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:30,820
our small towns going to big cities and

675
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:32,859
then and then they ask me how would you

676
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,580
solve it I said very simply just you

677
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:39,790
know export export work from big cities

678
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:41,529
to to the countryside and how we will do

679
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:44,290
it and so you have internet why you have

680
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:47,040
so many opportunities to do that and

681
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:51,040
also you can set up those small hops

682
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:54,820
I call it hops on the wheels I just go

683
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,619
out and set up some hop provisional hop

684
00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:02,690
over there we in my time and I

685
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:05,749
a little small before there was there

686
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:08,890
were buses going with books libraries

687
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:15,049
their bus is going with the you know

688
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:17,900
they were doing two surgeries and you

689
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:19,940
have buses now going they are even in

690
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,160
the United States right now if you can

691
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,829
find out taking your blood or checking

692
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,470
your blood or or your sugar so there's a

693
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:29,299
lot of opportunist we can use but people

694
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,038
are always interested to go to cities

695
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:35,599
because there is there there are

696
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:41,660
different kinds of opportunities and of

697
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:46,999
course you can do a robotic orchestra

698
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:50,990
playing you know in in a known Symphony

699
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:53,689
Hall but you know you can transfer this

700
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,308
this experience absolutely internet but

701
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,869
you will you don't have the same

702
00:37:55,309 --> 00:38:00,049
feelings like we are talking to each

703
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:01,759
other right now we are we are using some

704
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:03,200
expressions and you can you know

705
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:06,319
understand what I'm saying because I'm

706
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,710
also using my hands and and but this is

707
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:10,970
this is different work if you just do

708
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,900
everything through the internet so

709
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:16,129
that's why you go to City probably an

710
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:22,930
but there's a lot of people who wants to

711
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:26,720
go out sorry so thanks for the talk

712
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:30,919
about micro mobility cars on the streets

713
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:33,230
so the future that a lot of people are

714
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,170
talking about is that we have electrical

715
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:38,960
cars and that we've electrical scooters

716
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:41,329
or whatever well I'm seeing and what I

717
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,539
find it's not very attractive to me that

718
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:46,519
we are now changing the fuel cars to the

719
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:51,079
electric cars and have even more cars on

720
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:55,220
the street plus autonomous cars do you

721
00:38:51,079 --> 00:39:02,049
think the this the story of owning and

722
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:05,209
car can be how to say can be can be

723
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:07,970
changed to a story of shared mobility

724
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:10,580
what what would be a nice incentive for

725
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:13,069
people to stop owning one car

726
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:14,960
but be the only person in the car to

727
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:17,240
share the car with other people and to

728
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,340
reduce traffic so we have better air

729
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,459
more space and nicer cities so you

730
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:26,630
probably know you have a thank you for a

731
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:28,940
question yes it has actually couple it's

732
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:32,720
a variety of answer because you said

733
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:35,300
sharing cars sharing cars you mean that

734
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,149
you other people are using also your car

735
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:40,010
that's what do you mean probably

736
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,320
because sharing cars also mean that you

737
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,510
can you don't have to own car you just

738
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,970
use sharing service yeah

739
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:48,830
because otherwise I don't think it's

740
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:51,439
very attractive it's only attractive to

741
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:53,900
to the to the to the card for car deals

742
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,620
for car companies to give out shared

743
00:39:53,900 --> 00:40:01,640
cars we're actually not yeah so but I am

744
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:05,890
I always say it's a great idea to share

745
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:11,569
cars of course but let's start with

746
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:16,540
updating our regular transportation

747
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:19,820
transportation service make nice seats

748
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:22,400
make it so it doesn't smell inside so

749
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:25,880
start here because it's completely

750
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,480
different if you are using tram or bull

751
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,880
bus or metro and you have hundred people

752
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,940
inside it in that and then when

753
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,030
everybody will be able to use his own

754
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:40,340
car or somebody else car because you are

755
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:44,290
not a little solving problem is I even

756
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:47,810
think that having all those drivers

757
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:50,420
driver less cars give opportunity to

758
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:53,120
everybody to travel so what is going to

759
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:56,060
happen this that picture when when

760
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:59,210
everybody was on that micro ball micro

761
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:02,180
mobility in that bubble I believe that

762
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:03,530
it will be even worst than today so you

763
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:09,190
have to find out how we will regulate

764
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:11,870
this situation of so you can have shared

765
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,520
surveys but you will not be able to use

766
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:15,859
it because there's too many our cars

767
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,740
already so this okay no no more vehicles

768
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:21,110
inside this let's say downtown or inside

769
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,089
inside the zone so so but I want to go

770
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,930
there so there'll be a lot of

771
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:27,410
interesting

772
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:30,319
chants how many how much many minutes

773
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:33,080
two minutes three minutes okay I think

774
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:35,360
it's a real huge problem waiting for a

775
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,850
waiting for us and then also you said

776
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:41,690
electricity this is the other thing we

777
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:44,390
are only going to going a lot to

778
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:47,960
electricity powered car but we have

779
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:52,190
other opportunities I think that you

780
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:54,730
know there's much better solution than

781
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:58,580
electricity because we will be again

782
00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:00,980
again depending the air we depend on the

783
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,500
big guys who will actually serve so it's

784
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:05,150
not actually the opportunity opt out for

785
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,300
our recent solution

786
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:12,050
yes it's a probably a little bit better

787
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:13,550
for environment but on the other side we

788
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,590
have to have batteries how we will

789
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:18,530
liquidate those batteries nobody talks

790
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:20,600
about that today way and then you are

791
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:23,060
still you are making car somewhere else

792
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:29,500
somewhere else and you are moving it

793
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:38,000
here so a lot of the co2 behind you so

794
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:39,890
is it okay the trains and trams I like

795
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,070
them very much and I use them a lot and

796
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:44,420
I think I just think it would be a nice

797
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,190
step to make it more attractive to

798
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,460
people to use it more but I think the

799
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:51,440
story of owning a car is still very

800
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,540
strong and is something we have to

801
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,280
change but can you imagine that you have

802
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,320
a lot of I mean maybe you have a lot of

803
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,980
money you have a lot of money are you

804
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:05,180
want to have some nice car which smells

805
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:08,090
only you know your way and any of your

806
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:11,569
things there and you are used you have

807
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:14,480
to give up all that III don't care - I'm

808
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:16,070
not I'm not using car in city I when I

809
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,180
bring here I mean I come here I'm using

810
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:22,400
only transportation like tram and Metro

811
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,470
but there's many people who are sitting

812
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,400
every day in that car going

813
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:34,189
I always I'm always having fun when I'm

814
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,210
going so I'm crossing the logic which is

815
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,480
nasty

816
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:41,000
every day so it's a lot of crossings I'm

817
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,710
doing no no a lot of there are those

818
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,849
cars my CDs bark all those big cars want

819
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:53,630
