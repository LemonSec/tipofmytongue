10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,470

republic is your guy he also worked for

13
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:01,339
socialbakers so maybe those of you who

14
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,500
are interested in social media and

15
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:05,720

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,850
company so he did the research and

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,030
development for the socialbakers and

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:14,390
also he is a head of fund supporting

19
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:17,390
independent journalist so I think this

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,939
is a very strong and nice combination so

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,740
yourself thank you for being here with

22
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:24,408

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:30,520
presentation here so for his yours thank

24
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:35,300
you thank you okay the first

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,789
introduction why I'm here and the

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,450
problem is that I have no specific

27
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:44,780
reason Peter my English is horrible I'm

28
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:49,130
not a libertarian yes maybe 5 10 years

29
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:51,500
ago I was data guy and honestly I don't

30
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,350
think so this stage is really bad I

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:59,659
think that taxes are some kinds

32
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:04,729
necessary that why I'm here and the

33
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:08,479
reason is in one graph this is the

34
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:12,319
project built by academic guy which try

35
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,470
to simulate how social network works if

36
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,060
you try to gain some kinds of parameters

37
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:23,359
like the tolerance influence and

38
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:26,000
unfriending you can see what is a

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,760
development of the network if you see

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,590
the network where people just

41
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,340
unfriending often with a no influence

42
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:39,520
with a no tolerance

43
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:43,630
and you can immediately see what will be

44
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,700
probably scenario of this this mean the

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,630
reason why I'm here is that I would like

46
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,810
to say something

47
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:53,920
Raja what is for me important in the

48
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:57,489
concept of parallel police and I would

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,440
like to support this project in one

50
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,989
specific reason and try to find some

51
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,120
kinds of partners of police in the

52
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:09,120
specific fight in the current culture

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,120
okay

54
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:17,619
the concept of parallel police is not

55
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:20,590
new the 40 years ago was established the

56
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,170
Civic movement which name was the

57
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,890
hardest said said in the South Salem cut

58
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:29,079
the 77 in English it's interesting there

59
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:32,679
is a the snapshot of the some people who

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,900
sign this manifest of some kinds of

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,590
documents if you look on this you can

62
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,799
see there and the left up corner is a

63
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,140
Vaslav Havel the son of one of the

64
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,660
biggest check cultural entrepreneur in

65
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,000
the first Republic

66
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:52,030
there's also eg Dean's beer one of the

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,570
prominent communist journalists there is

68
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:58,570
also Ladislav hedonic he was the even

69
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,730
Greek fella and Phyllis off and there is

70
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,820
also vassal benda he was Catholic

71
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:07,119
philosophy this completely different

72
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:11,579
kinds of people go together and build

73
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:15,579
something which names hearta and try to

74
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,680
defend one specific group of the people

75
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,930
the Czech underground movement the music

76
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,240
underground movement because the initial

77
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:27,669
trigger of the beginning of the parallel

78
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:30,460
police concept is in the music how many

79
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:31,599
people are in the room from other

80
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,340
countries and from Czech Republic

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:39,669
preserve apparent great you need to

82
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:43,299
understand what is means the mainstream

83
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:44,870
culture in the 17th the one of the

84
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:50,180
famous

85
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,180
version in Czech Republic was a curl God

and the color got was the prominent of

96

the regime and their shape what is a

97
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,499
culture in Czech Republic mean but in

98
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:45,360
the middle of the 70s

99
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:49,489
there was some interesting movement

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,989
connected with the underground music and

101
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:55,529

people of the universe this is just a

103

108
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:06,799
same time but this kind of Evans was

109
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:10,070
weekly prohibit and canceled by the

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:15,440
police forces many of these people was

111
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:22,159
press by the power and their starter

112
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:23,810
huge court was was this group and that

113
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,250
was the reason why hurt the

114
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:31,910
seventy-seven was beginning they find a

115
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:36,200
nice such kinds of heck in the system

116
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:37,850
they press the regime has criticized the

117
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,630
government for failing to implement

118
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:44,690
human rights they go to the city hotel

119
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:49,250
hey mister president you sign it this a

120
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:53,240
civic rights declaration and you are not

121
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:56,450
behavior in the line was this this is

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,210
injustice in the sense in your law if

123
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:02,060
you look on this from this perspective

124
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:07,310
they was able to use the system against

125
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:11,840
the system the first the first

126
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:15,530
resolution of this movement was a huge

127
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,010
anti camping and something which was

128
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:22,330
called anti Carta but after few months

129
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:26,510
there was yet another kind of reaction

130
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:29,599
it was silenced the regime find a way

131
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,909
how to deal with this problem regime

132
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:36,010
continues into pressing these people in

133
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:39,950
the in their jobs they lost many jobs

134
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:43,370
they lost opportunities for public or

135
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:47,480
public performance etc etc but in

136
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:52,610
official media was silenced this

137
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,550
interesting way because if nobody caring

138
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,920
about you and about your protest

139
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,359
probably you can nothing change it's

140
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,520
time without the internet

141
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,700
its food depend of the for Eden

142
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,280
Broadcasting like the wise of America or

143
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,550
free Free Europe are broadcasting but

144
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:14,720
the

145
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:17,990
ow and Carter 77 was immediately after

146
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,490
one year in crisis and they try to find

147
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:25,700
a way how to survive in the communist

148
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:30,500
regime in the tellurian regime they try

149
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:35,209
to find a way how to be attractive for

150
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:39,589
the people and how to do something what

151
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:43,040
is able state what is able to unify

152
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:47,329
together a power of completely different

153
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,290
groups if you go back to the photo there

154
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:51,589
was a communist

155
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:54,349
there was a past communist there was a

156
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,899
trust kissed a Catholic intelligence

157
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:01,329
there was also the people who are in

158
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:05,149
this moment of right liberal etc etc

159
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:08,329
completely differs if ik that there was

160
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:11,329
completely diversification and the mr.

161
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:14,540
bender one of very interesting

162
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:21,079
intellectual in the in the country start

163
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:29,990
with a concept of parallel policies the

164
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:34,910
main idea was we have to care about the

165
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:38,839
police we have to it's our moral

166
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:41,540
obligation it's our data there is no way

167
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:45,800
how to go to inner ghetto there is no

168
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:50,469
way how to start with closed groups we

169
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:55,849
have to care about it we have to start

170
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:58,760
build a parallel structure for the

171
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:02,029
specific reason because we have to

172
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,180
substitute a missing or beneficial

173
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:10,610
functions of the state as an origin of

174
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:13,239
the parallel police is not built not opt

175
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,730
out the system

176
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,700
but start working on the parole

177
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:22,589
structure build the structure and in the

178
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,589
future be ready to overtake country

179
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,740
Ravinder defined a seven a basic RS of

180
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,689
this F for the first one was the

181
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,140
constant monitoring and verification on

182
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:38,740
civic rights and freedoms what does it

183
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:41,500
mean in the communist regime was the

184
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,709
just a list with activities which are

185
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,589
illegal which was legal and the rest was

186
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:51,339
prohibit let's mean the first strategy

187
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:54,720
was try to fine the borders of the

188
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:57,760
system occupied zone and try to defend

189
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,550
this is the main reason this is this was

190
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,490
the main area of this effort now we are

191
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:06,939
in a little bit different situation

192
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:09,880
because you know I understand why the

193
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,690
people don't believe in this system but

194
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,610
believe me that the previous system was

195
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,950
terrible but we have the similar

196
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:24,570
situation in many area the second one

197
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:27,790
was defend the underground culture why

198
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:31,839
because the underground culture was the

199
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:34,980
one of the most free in the country the

200
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,040
aesthetics of underground culture

201
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:42,010
honestly it's not my choice

202
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,050
but it's free and the people like the

203
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:49,050
previous prominent communist journalists

204
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:52,750
they start defend this kind of culture

205
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:57,339
because this culture was free regardless

206
00:12:52,750 --> 00:13:00,040
to taste regardless to own aesthetic

207
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:04,510
preferences I mean the second was the

208
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:08,079
defend the alternative culture there's

209
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:11,500
also the search one was the start with

210
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,859
parallel education and science spiral

211
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,070
education and science why the reason was

212
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:21,699
that the Czech Education and Science in

213
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:24,550
these times was strongly paralyzed by

214
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:26,140
ideological point of view by the way

215
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,040
it's interesting to see the papers about

216
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,590
the

217
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,490
computer science from this time and one

218
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:36,310
small note and many of Czech dissidents

219
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,680
was in 80s good programmers and

220
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,520
employees of biggest check state

221
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,349
companies as a computer programmers

222
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:49,060
don't ask me why but there was a lot of

223
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:51,390
people of them this mean the guys in the

224
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,510
Curtis and Assad sudden start with a

225
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:57,610
parallel education system with workshops

226
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,530
they try to invite the many interesting

227
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,560
scientists and philosophers from the

228
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:05,370
West and build the own such kinds of

229
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,469
university after world what revolution

230
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,990
these people immediately was able

231
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,450
overtake the universities especially in

232
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:18,100
the philosophy of Arts and continuing

233
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:20,950
this work interesting part was that vas

234
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:25,150
la banda was focused on information

235
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:28,630
system again it's the time where the

236
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:33,000
tight right machines was on the top of

237
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:35,950
technologies but they need and the Herta

238
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,260
necessary need for they work some

239
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:42,400
distributing system and it's interesting

240
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:45,490
that vassal banda wrote about we need to

241
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,510
care about the frequency we need care

242
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:52,540
about the language we need to care about

243
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:55,330
in the end marketing and PR that's not

244
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:59,079
been the words but it's right I mean

245
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:01,060
there was a strong information network

246
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,430
for the semester publishing and

247
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:07,599
unofficial magazine the fifth was the

248
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:12,699
interesting concept of the parallel

249
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:16,150
economy why the reason was that many

250
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,340
dissidents was cut from the good paid

251
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:21,220
jobs in the country because the

252
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:23,770
ideological reason yes many of them has

253
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,770
a special sources for example for that

254
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,090
for what's novel for the play writing

255
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,199
for the West

256
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:37,450
Cedric performance but the main issue

257
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:39,970
was that the people was not able run the

258
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:43,540
standard trusted sir

259
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:47,110
this market and there they start to

260
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:51,099
thinking about the reciprocity and trust

261
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:56,769
that was the real money trust for the

262
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:59,170
people in the people in the sixth

263
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:02,290
creation of pearl political structures

264
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,689
and promotion of a development the

265
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,810
alternative political structures must be

266
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:12,879
incubated in parallel porous and develop

267
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:17,410
into a form which can replace this is

268
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:22,990
interesting why because if you go back

269
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:27,279
in your head hard a 77 was something

270
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:30,360
like mash up up come off completely

271
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:34,089
different points of view completely and

272
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:37,420
they try to build the structure which in

273
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:40,120
core in the core incorporate the idea

274
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:44,110
about the democratic discussions about

275
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,649
the problem build this kind of parallel

276
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:50,379
structure and be ready replace the

277
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:59,160
system not believe the system but

278
00:16:50,379 --> 00:17:04,260
replace and the last point was we need

279
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:10,270
run the parallel for eating structures

280
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:13,230
we need start discuss with the Western

281
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:17,589
countries as a such kinds of

282
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:21,429
representation of Phrygia Slovakia this

283
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:25,599
is important because it's important from

284
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:27,640
the resources of course because you need

285
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:31,629
to find somebody who will be able to pay

286
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,360
for your polish but it's also important

287
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:38,140
for the sharing information from insane

288
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,809
country and the results of this was the

289
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:44,679
famous breakfast when the Francois

290
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:49,360
Mitterrand visited Czech Republic in the

291
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:51,460
half of 80s the lunch has this guy

292
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,669
together with some mister who stuck our

293
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,520
president

294
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:57,980
but breakfast was together with a Vaslav

295
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,800
Havel and this guy start like the

296
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:06,340
official represent or alternative to the

297
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,340
official representation of the state

298
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:13,670
okay

299
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:19,160
the quick summary in the origin was a

300
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:22,720
parole policy strategy not only for the

301
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,340
resistance but also for the building

302
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:31,190
full functional structures which can

303
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:34,760
replace the state and also it was some

304
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:37,250
kinds of incubation of discussion

305
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:42,440
between completely different ideological

306
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:46,460
point of view okay now we move to the

307
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:51,140
escape from system this topic of this

308
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:55,480
conference I'm so happy that romantics

309
00:18:51,140 --> 00:19:00,460
and the rest of the guy start with

310
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:03,080
reborn of the parallel policies concept

311
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,270
but if you look on the topic of this

312
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,699
conference you can see something a

313
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:11,230
little bit different

314
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:13,690
there was the primary intention of

315
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,640
parallel policies in the bender times

316
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:20,660
this is the claims from the website and

317
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:26,990
there is a nice you state sheets to heck

318
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:29,870
the tyrant and much more better you can

319
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:34,190
see use a cryptographic technology to

320
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:37,939
regain privacy achieve new freedom using

321
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:42,410
globality and flexibility by the way

322
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:47,570
this photo is from the mondo 2000s it's

323
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:50,120
a more than twenty year or 20 yeah 26

324
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:53,629
year old you can see what was the

325
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,899
picture of the cyberpunk ER and hacker

326
00:19:53,630 --> 00:20:01,400
in this time there is some interesting

327
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:06,220
points like a scanner there was some

328
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:10,070
kind of micro camera there was

329
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:12,230
something similarly to the GPS system if

330
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:17,210
you look on this now we have all this in

331
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:20,840
one cell phone but big but back to this

332
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:23,750
point name of this conference is a

333
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,600
hacker conference usually if you try to

334
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,560
find what is a definition of the hackers

335
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,360
probably find the infinity lists of

336
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,970
definition there is something about the

337
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,820
technical screws guy somebody speaking

338
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:42,850
about the possibility to do something

339
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:45,830
when the system etc etc but I love two

340
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:51,139
points from this in the cyberpunk

341
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:53,870
literature is a hacker somebody who is

342
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,990
something like the digital code boy he

343
00:20:53,870 --> 00:21:03,679
is able provide the Shadowrun

344
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:07,340
he's able be free because plate was the

345
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:10,420
corporations and states and this

346
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:17,919
position is strong individual position

347
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:24,140
or we can define the hackers as a people

348
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:28,720
who are able used the system against the

349
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:31,340
system they they are able to find the

350
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,690
places in the design of the whole system

351
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,699
and use this system against the primer

352
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:40,550
since the primer goal and thus people

353
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:45,440
are hackers and the second one these

354
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:48,440
people usually long for autonomy we saw

355
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,380
that use the system against the system

356
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:58,040
was primer strategy of the Harter 77 by

357
00:21:51,380 --> 00:22:00,590
the way okay we have the hard ass 77

358
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:04,190
with a pearl polished concept as a

359
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:06,709
strategy how to build a new a better

360
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,770
society how to replace the state

361
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:13,010
structure but the new state structure

362
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:16,460
this initiative is running by the moral

363
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:22,580
obligation to police

364
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:26,450
and this is drive-by non-ideological

365
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:28,210
point of view in some cans against we

366
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,580
stay with a concept of hackers and

367
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,840
especial topic of this conference was an

368
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,720
opt-out system

369
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,549
let's mean I don't care about the police

370
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,850
I don't care about I don't care about

371
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:43,009
the local stuff I care about them myself

372
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,049
and I would like to leave this system

373
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:47,269
it's old-fashioned cyberpunk of

374
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:49,519
cyberpunk way if you go back to the

375
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:51,799
gypsum gibson's novel slide in every

376
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:55,429
woman said we can find this idea there

377
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:58,309
also it's mean nothing new in just in

378
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:11,690
the new gadgets and the new concepts but

379
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:14,779
it's just the revival but I think that

380
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:21,679
this is not real this is not real

381
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:26,749
antinomy between this concept the first

382
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:28,820
one the mood of the hackers is a little

383
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:31,869
bit similar to the dissidents in the

384
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:36,230
seventies think that personal autonomy

385
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:40,879
is on the first place and the will of

386
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:43,220
the people is second one I think that it

387
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:45,439
could be a little bit strange but I try

388
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,110
to explain if you would like to

389
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,029
legitimate the modern state you have two

390
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:55,899
possibilities one of them is the state

391
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:58,999
its expression of the will of people

392
00:23:55,899 --> 00:24:02,360
this is all school Republican point of

393
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:08,480
view and the will of the people is on

394
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:13,668
the top if people want to kill you they

395
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:16,549
can because it's will of the people you

396
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:20,899
can see in the current situation in the

397
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:25,158
a huge populism wave in the in the world

398
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:27,320
that this is rising star and I think

399
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,830
that the there is similarities between

400
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,309
the dissidents between the hackers

401
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:36,439
between the some human rights initiative

402
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:40,009
between Anwar sorry and the vironment

403
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,559
Ellis etc because they try to say in the

404
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:46,720
end the liberal point of view sorry guys

405
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:49,789
there is something what is impeachable

406
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,929
what is the core of the society and

407
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:57,919
that's not the will of the people it's a

408
00:24:53,929 --> 00:25:01,940
human rights like the private owning

409
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:06,649
like the freedom of speech etc etc and

410
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:09,909
this is the core of society and we long

411
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:12,830
for autonomic private autonomy and

412
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:15,289
somebody is able to do it with your

413
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:18,980
computer but there is many people who

414
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:22,519
are autonomy in their gardens in their

415
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:24,190
religious etc these people just to try

416
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:28,210
to say please

417
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:35,179
no well of the people on the first place

418
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:40,789
ok that's the first point I think the

419
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:45,350
problem in this situation is that people

420
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:49,009
like you and partially like me are not

421
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:51,678
connected with the local movement if you

422
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:54,590
are not from the specific regimes a

423
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,649
totally and totally Ernst regime we

424
00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:01,908
enjoy the stuff like the revolute cart

425
00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:05,750
uber Airbnb and we spend a lot of time

426
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:08,929
out of country we don't care about the

427
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:13,100
local place because we are usually use

428
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:16,190
the freedom of movement but if you look

429
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:21,379
on the data probably this kind of people

430
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:24,889
is just a 5 person from this country the

431
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:27,980
rest of the people maybe once time in

432
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:31,070
here moved from their city to other city

433
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:35,629
orders at the country these people has

434
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:39,590
no a deep a technological knowledge they

435
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:42,799
have usually a better education and

436
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,428
usually then just a care about the next

437
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:49,309
day

438
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:51,799
I mean these people are running the

439
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:57,918
populism wave in the country because

440
00:26:51,799 --> 00:27:02,658
they believe that there is a no reason

441
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:04,849
why prefer the human rights there is

442
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:08,419
just a question about the red

443
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:14,269
distribution of money and they believe

444
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:26,450
that in some kinds is a dictatorships

445
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:30,200
better way than democracy okay you can

446
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:33,440
see this track just a few metres out of

447
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:38,269
this room I think that the track power

448
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,399
poorest track it's perfect idea but if

449
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:43,639
you stay there and try to understand

450
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,879
what is a content of the species to the

451
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:49,279
people there is okay we are ready to run

452
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:52,939
through the country and promote the

453
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:56,089
parallel policy over and over and what

454
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,339
is the main topics the privacy the

455
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:59,320
second one is a freedom is escape from

456
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:04,849
the state

457
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:09,249
hey young guys nobody in this country

458
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:11,918
except you and me care about the privacy

459
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:14,539
there's no real problem of these people

460
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,419
they have completely different problems

461
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:19,639
and this is so abstract this mean I

462
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:22,429
think that is a great idea to trial try

463
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:27,228
to disseminate the parallel polish to

464
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:33,710
the other cities but not in this way the

465
00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:38,509
fine part I think that there is some way

466
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,749
how to try combined together the idea of

467
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:45,919
pearl police from the bender time and

468
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:49,239
from the time of this Congress sorry for

469
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,829
the marketing concept of distributed

470
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:53,700
Republic maybe you know the distributed

471
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:59,970
Republic at the term kind

472
00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:02,429
I drove by the Stevenson neo Stevenson

473
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:06,899
no well as the snow crashing Dimond H

474
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:09,000
and there is no deep theory of what is

475
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:11,689
distributed republic is yes there is

476
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,620
some book about the poor estate etc etc

477
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,620
but I love this term

478
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:21,750
maybe it's much better to thinking about

479
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:24,360
this idea similarly to the leaks in the

480
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:29,340
Greek Greek antiquity the Greek

481
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:33,928
city-state city-state Federation's it's

482
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:42,600
mean you can see over the whole old

483
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:46,950
Greek a network of the policies which

484
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:50,908
are based in local condition some of

485
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:54,240
them are on the top of technologies some

486
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:56,850
of them are just the marketplaces some

487
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,970
of these cities is driving by the dump

488
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:05,039
people but they still our

489
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:07,860
self-government and this policies are in

490
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,679
one Federation which care about the rest

491
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,110
of the stuff like the ok it seems that

492
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,960
Persians are going here it's time to

493
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:21,090
fight a called the stupid guys from the

494
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Sparta we need them this is the idea try

495
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:29,510
to distribute a concept of power

496
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:33,690
policies not in the technological life

497
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:37,700
but in the ethos in the moral scope the

498
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:40,620
same like in the heart of 77 because

499
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:44,909
people understand that something is

500
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:47,518
wrong but the what is wrong it's

501
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:50,340
different if you are in the village and

502
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:54,779
it's a different in the big city this

503
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:59,668
mean it's necessary to be ready start

504
00:30:54,779 --> 00:31:04,529
the real discussion and yeah I know if

505
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:06,879
you go out you can see many strange

506
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:11,899
people like a socialist

507
00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:14,570
environmentalist maybe there is some

508
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:20,629
liberals these people have completely

509
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:22,610
different type world you know in Prague

510
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:25,879
we have the specific experience with the

511
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:29,149
project which name was clinica like the

512
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:34,340
upside-down project for two parallel

513
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:38,029
police but all these people share the

514
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:42,529
same idea the idea is we prefer our

515
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:44,450
autonomy we prefer the rights we think

516
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:48,970
that sovereignty of the people is the

517
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:52,399
second one not the first one by the way

518
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:58,490
when I try to find some illustration to

519
00:31:52,399 --> 00:32:01,158
this this is the education material for

520
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:05,869
the high school it's a simulation how to

521
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:07,639
build the real Greek city and you need

522
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:09,678
to find a way how to manage the

523
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:11,840
resources and this is also interesting

524
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:19,490
why how to share with the people our

525
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:22,759
ideas I believe that the best regulation

526
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:25,999
is self regulation and the best

527
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:27,559
governance is the self governance but I

528
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:29,899
think that the idea of distributed

529
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,450
Republic offered to ask the interesting

530
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:33,830
opportunities like ok probably we are

531
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:39,470
not able to run the state like the

532
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:41,210
liberland on the 100 meter but we are

533
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,240
able offer to repeat to the people

534
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,879
something like the dual citizenship as a

535
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,220
membership in this Federation it's mean

536
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:52,279
if I come to the different city I know

537
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,289
that this is my friend police this is

538
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:57,799
the people who are the same like-minded

539
00:32:54,289 --> 00:33:04,299
like me I can find our help if something

540
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:07,668
is wrong etcetera etcetera we are able

541
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:10,340
slowly start with the concept of a poor

542
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:16,190
rural state outside of geographic

543
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:19,169
boundaries and we are able to change the

544
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:24,900
definition of the state from

545
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:28,530
a form of organized violation to

546
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:31,350
something like Express of my identity of

547
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:33,960
my values we need to understand the

548
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:38,689
people with the same values on the top

549
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:43,230
could be a radically different in the

550
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:46,920
specific area probably you are so smart

551
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:49,400
people and the reason is that you are

552
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:52,980
here and try to understand something new

553
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:57,540
its problem that smart people like you

554
00:33:52,980 --> 00:34:00,920
usually are able find a similarities and

555
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:05,010
differences more depleted under people

556
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:09,750
that's fine by in the end they usually

557
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:12,418
over valuate these differences from the

558
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:17,130
people from the street who try to push

559
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:20,219
some outer it in after 18 regimes my

560
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:23,669
position new position is the same it's

561
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:29,489
just small references between these

562
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:32,129
people and I think that if we are able

563
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,649
to run something like a network or

564
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:37,649
police distributed Republic the

565
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:44,159
Federation of the cities we are able to

566
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:47,880
completely change the map for example

567
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,600
there still is the same problem like the

568
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:55,260
testing the limits of freedom we need to

569
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,920
again again test what is possible for

570
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,690
example in this moment we spend a lot of

571
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,320
time of social networks like the

572
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:07,620
Facebook or Twitter but honestly do you

573
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,430
understand what is a legal on the

574
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:13,500
Facebook which kind of content will be

575
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:16,560
destroy immediately by the Facebook

576
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,470
though but the Facebook is in this

577
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,440
moment one of the crucial part of public

578
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:24,720
sphere nobody cares nobody press the

579
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,540
Facebook just a Mark Zuckerberg sit and

580
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,209
say hey tell me what I have to do why I

581
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:34,900
do it as a

582
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:37,930
and also the technological Underground

583
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:42,460
is on the first place I think that the

584
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:45,160
hackers in this sense I thumb are

585
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:51,130
something like the underground in the

586
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:56,680
70s the most free and also most freaks

587
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:59,559
in the in the in the project and it's

588
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:03,759
necessary open much more discriminated

589
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:05,800
to other people and bring to them the

590
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,790
possibilities which we know there is a

591
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:16,809
huge gap between our knowledge and

592
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:18,579
everyday life of the people so far

593
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:20,950
there's also education and science

594
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:24,460
against the similar situation like the

595
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:27,009
70s but the problem is that there is a

596
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,490
huge gap between the periphery and the

597
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:33,670
centers if you are born in Prague you

598
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:38,229
have probably good chance receive the

599
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:39,970
perfect education if you are born sorry

600
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,470
for the example example from Czech

601
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:46,930
Republic in Karlovy Vary

602
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:52,089
or dnad Lublin you will be punished for

603
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:54,640
the place then where you was born and we

604
00:36:52,089 --> 00:37:00,578
have technological way how to improve it

605
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:04,629
and nobody cares about these people and

606
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:08,680
these people then go and work for the

607
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:11,950
mr. O'Connor and etc there's also

608
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:15,970
interesting in the area connected with

609
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:21,578
local currency we still discuss about

610
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:24,520
the bitcoins but hey honestly if you are

611
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:29,410
work in the factory really would like to

612
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:31,000
receive your salary in bitcoins the

613
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:34,089
price of coffee change in the tens

614
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,420
minutes if you go there and back it's

615
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:40,299
nonsense it's interesting concept it is

616
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:44,030
fine I love the Bitcoin concept but for

617
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:48,290
the usual people is completely non less

618
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:50,180
senseless sorry but there is something

619
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:53,330
interesting the concept of local

620
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:55,970
currencies this mean currents is powered

621
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:58,940
by the communities but the local cities

622
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,890
if you are bill if we are will be able

623
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:04,160
to explain to the people why his good

624
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,868
way start with the local currencies they

625
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,109
probably understand in the future on the

626
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:11,240
concept of bitcoins etc but we need to

627
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:14,900
start with discussion hey what is your

628
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,609
needs usually we start with question hey

629
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:21,920
we have a problem and solution it's your

630
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:26,420
problem to know and there is a lot of

631
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:29,359
other possibilities and I'm not able to

632
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:33,490
see what everything is possible it's

633
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:37,279
been let's something new coming up okay

634
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:39,560
the 40 minutes is out I thank you for

635
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,020
attention and how so I hope so that

636
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,210
there is something interesting for you

637
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,880
maybe the video of Carl got and plastic

638
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:52,940
people of the universe and now it's time

639
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:56,119
for so thank you as f thank you for your

640
00:38:52,940 --> 00:39:00,260
talk I I definitely have to say that I

641
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:03,730
think we need to have this kind of talks

642
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:06,050
more often in Polish because it's very

643
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:09,349
important I think to negotiate the

644
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:13,400
meaning of the Polish and the purpose so

645
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:16,490
audience and now it's your turn to help

646
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,570
us to define the police so maybe you can

647
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,569
start with a question

648
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:32,520
I thank you for your presentation it was

649
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:35,669
interesting and you mentioned that it's

650
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:39,150
very difficult for a regular like normal

651
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:41,610
people to grasp the ideas of privacy and

652
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:45,960
everything so what do you suggest to

653
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:48,330
make it less like crazy for them what

654
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,600
how to bridge the gap between like

655
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:52,190
people like us and normal people if you

656
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,080
say so

657
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:58,080
yeah I understand you give me a second

658
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,450
it's it's it's hard to say yeah I think

659
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,590
that on the first place is education in

660
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:08,669
the end yeah we don't promoting the idea

661
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:12,390
of privacy on public space because

662
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:14,670
usually we are experts but many people

663
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:18,180
think that the right for privacy is not

664
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:20,190
real right it's something new but if

665
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:23,419
you're thinking about the you're right

666
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:28,440
for private correspondence it's

667
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:30,810
old-fashioned rights it's 300 oh yeah

668
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,710
and I think that we need to much more

669
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:37,100
say okay if somebody break your private

670
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:41,820
communication it's the same like the

671
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:44,940
start read your letters to the public we

672
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:48,480
need to find a much more a metaphor

673
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:51,060
cases which are understandable and the

674
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,540
second one I think that people usually

675
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:58,380
think that they opinion are not

676
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:03,090
important for their life they think that

677
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,320
okay what is my opinion who cares and we

678
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:06,300
need to encourage the people to

679
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,600
understand that they open in it's

680
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:16,760
important it's a long term in short term

681
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:16,759
I think that the way it could be was the

682
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:24,000
defending of broken this law publicly

683
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:26,010
this mean if we see some case where this

684
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,990
privacy is broken we need to go there

685
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:33,090
until hey this is the problem because my

686
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:35,759
job in this moment is a defender

687
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:37,850
journalist and in this case it's clear

688
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,670
because without the

689
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:43,130
the right for the privacy you are not

690
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:46,480
able run the good journalist work with

691
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:52,510
the sources and sometime somebody kill

692
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:56,120
let me try to find it in the local area

693
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:59,210
the cases I know that's not easy but

694
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,370
still there are good example and I think

695
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:04,430
that people care about it is a facebook

696
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:07,640
privacy cases because everybody has

697
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:12,560
everybody has the account there and if

698
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:14,629
you go ok really are you happy with that

699
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,970
I had Facebook knows that you this

700
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:22,370
girl sorry for this the Facebook know

701
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:30,169
much more than your wife and I think

702
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:32,089
that this could be interesting way I'd

703
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,910
like just to add a thought on what your

704
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:39,200
question was about so I think it's it's

705
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:42,319
about listening to them and both are the

706
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,649
existential threats yeah they are facing

707
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:50,300
in their daily life and if we start

708
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:54,110
asking them what are their fears and

709
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:56,030
start to build our stories the way we

710
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,950
explain things around that I think that

711
00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:00,230
would be a much better approach than

712
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,980
coming with our let's say intellectual

713
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,930
perspective

714
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,750
yeah and force it and push it and get

715
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,830
there yeah that's really yeah definitely

716
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,530
that's that's my point

717
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:12,770
but it's necessary to be said that

718
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:15,410
usually people if you ask what is your

719
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,840
problem usually don't tell me what is

720
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,390
your real problem it is necessary to

721
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:23,480
combine this is much more research yeah

722
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:25,310
for example and typically in Czech

723
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,610
Republic was a huge wave the

724
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:31,160
anti-immigration wave probably nobody

725
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:33,830
has a problem with the immigrants there

726
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,200
is something deeply but what we need to

727
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:38,240
find and solve but yeah we need to start

728
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:42,500
listening people and then offer this

729
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,259
ocean because we have for many cases a

730
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,970
technology technological solution but

731
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,300
usually this is no problem for the

732
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,299
people

733
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,009
okay anybody else okay maybe we have

734
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:59,440
still few minutes you can do questions

735
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:05,589
but you can just maybe share your

736
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:07,809
opinion with us also hi I really enjoyed

737
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:09,489
your presentation particularly because

738
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:12,099
you were comparing what's happening

739
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:15,970
today which was was happening the Czech

740
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:18,039
Republic in the past also agree with

741
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:21,970
your point of view I'm not an anchor

742
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:24,970
myself I mean new to this world and it

743
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:27,700
seems I have a bad impression that what

744
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:29,738
we are talking about here is really

745
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:32,529
disconnected from what's happening

746
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:33,880
outside just to give you an example now

747
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:36,640
I have a couple of friends in the Czech

748
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,239
Republic who are around 40 and they told

749
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,720
to me

750
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:43,599
Angela life under communism and life

751
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,029
under wide the capitalism apparently are

752
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,430
the same there is the same lack of

753
00:44:46,029 --> 00:44:50,410
freedom of expression and at least

754
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:52,960
during communism I was in tight or to

755
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,819
have a house so to come back to the

756
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,309
issue of what are the real problem of

757
00:44:54,819 --> 00:45:00,788
people I think about costing of houses I

758
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:04,559
think about a bit absurd lack of social

759
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:08,710
security nowadays and I think that

760
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:11,890
crypto people can play a role in that in

761
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:14,829
imagining an alternative a model of

762
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:18,940
social security based on a different of

763
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:21,609
idea of money and I see an opportunity

764
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:25,509
for dialogue but this is not going to

765
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:27,089
happen as long as you stay close your

766
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:29,499
closed environment

767
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:36,069
talking only to people who belong to

768
00:45:29,499 --> 00:45:39,220
your own environment I agree with the

769
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:41,410
many people in this country agree with

770
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:44,519
the statement that the communism and

771
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:48,879
capitalism was the same in the end I

772
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:49,910
think that this is just the cognitive

773
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:55,310
dissonance

774
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:58,759
not not the real opinion but where I see

775
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:02,210
the possibilities is the start caring

776
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:05,450
about the local problem yeah I know that

777
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:08,660
the prices of houses is so high but

778
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:11,450
there is a so many problem in your city

779
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:16,399
which is not connected with this for

780
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:19,430
example the environment for example the

781
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,800
culture in the streets for example drugs

782
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:24,890
in the streets this is the local problem

783
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:28,250
if the people start try to solve this

784
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:31,370
local problem they maybe will be able

785
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:35,240
against find a belief that they could

786
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:38,480
something change if you try it we lost

787
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:41,479
this belief we don't believe that we are

788
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,690
able to change something in the system

789
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:47,480
and this is the reason why we try to

790
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:49,610
find a way how to opt out this assists

791
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,130
them if you look for an example on the

792
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:54,410
slovakia in this moment after there was

793
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:58,400
two years one year ago there was killed

794
00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:00,230
the journalist which name was kodiak the

795
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,060
situation in the slovakia is it's a

796
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:04,100
capture state there is no difference

797
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:08,299
between the state and organised crime if

798
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:11,509
we look on this but after huge protests

799
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:14,450
in the streets after this horrible

800
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:17,090
murder people start again believe that

801
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:19,100
they could something change and start

802
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:23,240
with the self-organization the current

803
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:26,029
president of the slovakia was the NGO

804
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:28,399
activist who tried to solve the problem

805
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:31,790
with the garbage in the small slovak

806
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:34,180
city and she was able to it yet it mean

807
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:37,250
we need to start in the small things

808
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:39,680
which is different in the different

809
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:41,810
countries and the different cities it's

810
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,990
understand what i mean what is the right

811
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,990
way

812
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:54,340
okay we are running out of time so I

813
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:57,220
think this was the last note from yessuh

814
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:01,030
and I think it was just very right on

815
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:03,850
the point that we think not to go to

816
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:08,440
global but also look at local thing and

817
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:10,420
think more about the local issues but I

818
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,150
would like to add a one point thank you

819
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:15,280
for opening questions which we need to

820
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:18,250
be answered like I hope that you also

821
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,560
are here because you think of opting out

822
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:23,230
what does it mean how it refers to you

823
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:25,090
know what we need to opt out from and we

824
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:27,520
know that right now is behavior is

825
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:29,260
happening a panel discussion when people

826
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,380
from parenting polish and crypto

827
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:34,840
communities are discussing what it means

828
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,480
to be this like the specific communities

829
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:38,980
and even in Peroni polish Prague I can

830
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,530
see already the difference like that

831
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,360
opting out from the state is a very much

832
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,430
statement of Paula Paula loop dark and

833
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,900
romantic is because you were ever

834
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:49,089
referring to them in the beginning

835
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:51,760
it's much more tonal at all talking

836
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:54,250
about like creating a parallel structure

837
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,920
which work which not it's not

838
00:48:54,250 --> 00:49:01,390
cooperating it's a mom living next to it

839
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,980
and creating this new newness yeah but

840
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,350
what I would like to end in the end is

841
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,560
that what I found out and what I found

842
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:10,779
out from this like like how to people

843
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,670
teach about what is freedom while you

844
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:15,970
need to care about the privacy what

845
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:18,370
helps very well is materiality you need

846
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,649
to find the way how to materialize the

847
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:22,870
thing you know how to make it happen I

848
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:25,360
would say if you we talk about like all

849
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:28,509
the code we talk about the design you

850
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,550
know you weeks and UI so in this case

851
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,950
with these big topics we also need to

852
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:35,740
find this material where we can express

853
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:38,290
it and that's very more about design so

854
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,910
when you look at the black building you

855
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:42,220
will maybe stomach you can start to

856
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:45,100
think about how design and materiality

857
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:47,620
can help you to spread this dress so

858
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,470
definitely thank you yourself thank you

859
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,529
thank you guys

860
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,529
you

861
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:02,930
you
