interesting events are waiting for you

22
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:35,890
so before I would like to explain you

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,229
the slug and opt-out we decided to

24
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,929
choose for this year because every year

25
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:45,459
we have a bit different topic and this

26
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:49,530
year we decided for up out so what was

27
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:53,050
the idea behind behind this decision

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,759
firstly after so many years we realized

29
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:59,880
that we tripped on our kissed

30
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,700
voluntaries libertarian freedom lovers

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:08,288
be where we are and also we will be in

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:10,270
the future always in minority and and it

33
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:14,708
is really crucial to realize this

34
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:17,200
important fact so it means that that

35
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:21,580
democratic system we are just leading

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,019
now cannot lead to more freedom or more

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,790
free society

38
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,300
so it is really important to realize

39
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:31,540
this file to cope with this fact but

40
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:34,380
don't desperate because because what we

41
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:39,429
have now is a global internet community

42
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:42,970
with connecting million of people with

43
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,220
different different people with the same

44
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,500
taste and a taste and this taste of

45
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,050
freedom and this is exactly what pearl

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,330
pol is trying to do so we are a

47
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,730
community now fully working in

48
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,790
Bratislava and Prague probably starting

49
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,980
in one money in Barcelona or there also

50
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,739
in Vienna and what we are trying to do

51
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,230
we are trying to connect all these

52
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,900
people with the same taste for freedom

53
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,810
together and we are trying to show these

54
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,120
people how it's possible to make a

55
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:17,860
parallel society and how to opt out of

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:22,030
the system so let's collect this

57
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:25,390
community and this conference you you

58
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,760
you will see a lot of presentation how

59
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:31,839
it is possible to use current crypto

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:35,380
technology and various legislation hacks

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,140
various legislation loopholes our

62
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:42,430
legislation tricks to achieve more

63
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:44,829
freedom so what is important achieved

64
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:49,480
new freedom using gullibility and

65
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:51,220
flexibility opt out of the system so

66
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,399
this is a very short explanation and now

67
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,070
I'm going to describe our dear speakers

68
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,650
we'll have at this year of the

69
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,230
conference so first one and one of the

70
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:07,620
most important one is Robin Hanson Robin

71
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:10,510
Hanson is is inventor of the of the term

72
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,080
super key maybe you know that these few

73
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,850
turkeys is a society the concept of

74
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,040
society which is based on prediction

75
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:21,219
markets so Rob enhancer is really

76
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,880
focused on prediction market he wrote

77
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:29,020
two interesting books the first book is

78
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:32,080
called the elephant in the brain it's

79
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,990
about it about statuses of in our

80
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,580
society and the second one is the age of

81
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,200
M it's about possibility about future

82
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,750
society where it will be possible to

83
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,810
make a kilometer of human brain i

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:51,760
strongly recommended to read

85
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:54,729
bodies books this year Robin Hanson will

86
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:59,770
have a presentation here about radical

87
00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:02,469
concept of criminal criminal proposal

88
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,990
how it how we can how we can change our

89
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,380
approach to self

90
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,840
criminal criminal act another very

91
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,990
important speaker will be loose cuenta

92
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,929
loose Q&A is the main guy behind the

93
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,780
project Aragon Aragon del Dallas is

94
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,820
decentralized autumn's organization for

95
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:27,340
those who don't know what is what that

96
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:28,960
exactly means so in these days the

97
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,810
government are loose with Ramona poly

98
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,900
over issuing money thanks to

99
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,510
cryptocurrencies but still they have

100
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,190
monopoly over business licenses so if

101
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,539
you want to create company you can

102
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,660
create Czech company you can create the

103
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,510
US company but still the license the

104
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,460
licenses are issued by the specific

105
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,140
governments but in the future probably

106
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,049
this won't be true because they'll

107
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,330
basically means that thanks to smart

108
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,300
contracts you would be able to create

109
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,789
any decentralized organization or any

110
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:05,440
decentralized company store agreement

111
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:08,560
between order of this company into the

112
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,490
blockchain and and start completely

113
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,070
decentralized unstoppable unstoppable

114
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,220
organization and exactly well this loose

115
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,110
go and we'll have a presentation another

116
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:25,150
interesting speaker is Nikhil Metatron

117
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:26,740
Nikhil me to town it's a guy from from

118
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:32,010
Oxford and he will have a presentation

119
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:34,150
about non existing states about very

120
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,800
interesting States you are probably not

121
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:40,030
ever

122
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,990
we have kobani and dissident from from

123

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:53,020
and probably also from North Korea

126
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:55,000
so we try to have people from all these

127
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,799
dictatorship countries they will they

128

130
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,680
freedom how what kind of technologies

131
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:09,150
they use another important speakers

132
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:14,379
Trevon case he is from Philippines and

133

Trevino will have a presentation how it

134
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:21,490
is possible using his pretty bad

135
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:24,400
passport to get visas and residency in

136
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:27,990
the most most countries so he's like a

137
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:32,400
some kind of state hacker

138
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:36,580
ken shook insolent can can is

139
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,549
responsible for writing really important

140
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,550
book the name of this book is I think

141
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:47,289
it's stories of Jonathan gleeble it's

142
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:49,419
the unartistic book for children and it

143
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:52,030
was translated it was translated

144
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:53,650
probably to 100 languages different

145
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,369
languages in the Slovak language and

146
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:59,469
Czech language and if you if you want to

147
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,509
teach an orca to your children maybe you

148
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:03,849
should start with this book strongly

149
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:08,219
recommended and then we had a lot of

150
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:10,419
regular speakers with their new

151
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:13,509
mind-blowing presentation like Paul

152
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:15,580
Rosenberg smuggle your blood see Europe

153
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:19,150
and bednar and much more

154
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,068
unfortunately we I don't have time to

155
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,349
speak about all speakers we will have

156
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:28,750
this year at HTTP but we have more than

157
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:31,599
45 speakers together but I would like to

158
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:35,020
mention three important panel discussion

159
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,360
we all have here the first one which be

160
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,270
moderated by me it's called crypto

161
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,270
liberation community panel so it seemed

162
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:45,100
that in Europe now we have like growing

163
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,040
crypto liberation communities in

164
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:52,360
different cities so people from Germany

165
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,890
from Austria from Spain from Slovakia

166
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,730
from Czech Republic from all this

167
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:59,589
country that are trying to build

168
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,600
parallel policies or their own crypto

169
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,360

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:33,350
also some other presentations about

220

221
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:40,130
like a projection of not a completely

222
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,609
new film but about new film about

223
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:46,160
Czechoslovakia crypto community which is

224
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:50,540
still in progress and I think tonight

225
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:55,579
you you can see premiere of this of this

226
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:58,040
film and the last thing is that in front

227
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,120
of parallel police there is like a huge

228
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,140
truck

229
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,000
it's called decent truck and because we

230
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,949
consider our thoughts and ideas to be

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,410
really important we decided to spread

232
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:15,560
our ideas physically and we bought like

233
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:19,400
a physical truck we call we call it

234
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,880
doesn't track and we would like to use

235
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,920
these

236
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,740
Desson truck to visit a lot of places

237
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:29,900
and promote crypto key crypto liberation

238
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,190
cryptocurrencies so I think at these

239
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,620
times already open

240
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:38,140
so don't hesitate this doesn't track

241
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:41,750
when you go out of pearl polish and

242
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:45,020
