this years makes my fifth year the

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:52,530
hackers Congress yeah half a decade it's

33
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,350
really an honor to be able to keep

34
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,590
coming here what happens is that every

35
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,259
year before the hackers Congress I start

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,659
losing faith and start getting a bit

37
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,429
cloudy in my thoughts and weather the

38
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,469
direction I'm going in is the correct

39
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:09,270
path though I really do appreciate

40
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,209
having an environment like these that

41
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:16,580
boost our energy up again and resets

42
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:19,410
your system so my name is I mean Rafi

43
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,200
last year I kind of started with a term

44
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,880
blockchain therapist because I felt like

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,130
more people needed a therapist and a

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,269
blockchain so I've just adopted the name

47
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,850
for myself for fun yeah although it's

48
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,630
funny you know you can find me on

49
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,140
Twitter

50
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,680
evey 0 K 3 D I would love to get in

51
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,790
touch with you

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,849
you learn about what you're doing in

53
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,760
your project your organization any other

54
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:47,608
areas that may be of interest I have

55
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,548
been involved since 2013 I work with

56
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:54,180
decentralized projects in various

57
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:56,239
sectors of this space whether it's cloud

58
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,560
storage whether it's communication

59
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:04,500
lending and other areas at the moment I

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,469
have moved to Mexico so I'm living in

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,959
Oaxaca in Mexico it's a beautiful city

62
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:12,000
the reason I moved there is because I

63
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:16,859
feel that a lot of these technologies

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,620
are very useful in emerging markets so I

65
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,250
lived in Netherlands I grew up in

66
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,829
Australia

67
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,989
I'm originally from Iran I lived in

68
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,239
Berlin I've lived in Cyprus and now I'm

69
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,879
in Mexico this allows me to have a

70
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,359
holistic view on what is going on at

71
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,250
least to a sector of the world combining

72
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,260
the experience and the knowledge of what

73
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,099
is going on in these countries allows me

74
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,530
to have an oversight and understanding

75
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:46,828
of what tools are necessary and which

76
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:49,169
will have the greater impact so I will

77
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,690
give you some insight into those as we

78
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:55,379
move forward and the talk will be

79
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:58,228
presented in three stages which is what

80
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,388
I want to see which is what we want to

81
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,189
see in the future the limitations that

82
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,439
are holding us back from getting there

83
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:06,918
and also how do we overcome these

84
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,478
limitations so let's start the journey

85
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,370
this is a video which I found quite

86
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,750
funny I don't know how many of you seen

87
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,139
it but I like to always start with a

88
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,209
little video just they have to swap the

89
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,630
audio if you don't mind pausing for a

90
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,630
second

91
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,340
do you want deeming the life

92
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,090

93
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,180

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,690
approximately a thousand lemon coins oh

95
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,190

96
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,669

97
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,750
face this is 2018 I only accept

98

102
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,610
of utility yet but we're working on it

103
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,860
one day it might go to a dollar

104
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:29,880
[Laughter]

105
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:34,410

difficult I can sense your frustration

113
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,780
think about it it's the future of

114
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,930
business a trustless system without

115
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,340

116
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,650

protocol okay

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:41,070
okay smile say gave I see this would

130
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,020
take three to five days to process after

131
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,940
that when you are approved you will

132
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,169
probably not be notified so check back

133
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,580
and Vika so this is ridiculous you're

134
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,620
telling me that if anybody wants to buy

135

lemonade they need to go through this

136
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,790
process yeah I'm telling you this is the

137
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,810
future of business I've already got like

138
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,810

congratulations your account is verified

141
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:20,560
funds deposited you have a private key

142
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,050

143
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,370
nine eight five six nine it's just my

144
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:38,470

146
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:44,410
it it's always good to have a laugh

147
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:47,590
right it's moving forward so there are

148
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,240
limitations but the future is bright so

149
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,679
we all want to see a future where things

150
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,540
are decentralized where things are

151
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,520
transparent but how do we get there

152
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,410
there are many obstacles along the way

153
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,590
because we have been living in a very

154
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,510
centralized society this society's void

155
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,789
of accountability a lot of the things

156
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,980
that occur with aids in organisations

157
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,650
like such as the UN IMF banking

158
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,850
institutions or your regular business

159
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:15,370
institutions there is limitations in how

160
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,230
accountabilities measured so these

161
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,740
centralized systems allow people to

162
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:23,080
overcome their to certain degree while

163
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,480
this is great we do have to pay

164
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,680
attention to what is hindering our

165
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,900
progress so to look at those aspects we

166
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,150
have to first understand where it is

167
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,789
that we want to reach so these are some

168
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:39,520
of the goals that I believe are quite

169
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:41,740
important such as the ability to have

170
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,439
control of your identity such as the

171
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,470
ability to have control over your money

172
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,050
be your own bank other aspects include

173
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,730
the freedom of speech freedom of freedom

174
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,400
of collaboration freedom of association

175
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:57,190
and you can see other pointers there

176
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,100
these are great these are things that we

177
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,650
can aim for the depending on what

178
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,690
organization you're working with some of

179
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,970
these may not be a priority of

180
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,540
importance so then we have to modify

181
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,160
them based on the tasks that we need to

182
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,630
complete or the project that we are

183
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:20,050
trying to bring to

184
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:22,260
surface so limitations exists currently

185
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:26,079
based on that video that you see

186
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:29,020
usability the ability to adopt new users

187
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,750
the ability to use applications that are

188
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,680
currently existing on a wide array and

189
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,400
an all-encompassing knowledge to be able

190
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,969
to navigate through these very difficult

191
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,500
applications and as it moves forward we

192
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,050
have other aspects which is the

193
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,050
decision-making so to give you some

194
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:57,939
examples we have custodial versus

195
00:09:50,050 --> 00:10:00,520
non-custodial parent occurrences it's no

196
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,290
longer the era where we go and purchase

197
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,900
them from people those times have

198
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,030
changed I've been around since 2013 some

199
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,699
of you longer some of you shorter the

200
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,500
history has changed we have gone from a

201
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,090
point where we used to purchase

202
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,640
cryptocurrencies peer to peer through

203
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:18,970
IRC through chat rooms this is how I did

204
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,310
it and times changed too now average

205
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,340
user will go to coin base and these very

206
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,020
centralized organizations whether this

207
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,360
is the wrong way to go about it or not

208
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,270
is a personal decision for me it's not

209
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:35,500
the way I like to do it the there are

210
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:40,180
risks and benefits with each choice with

211
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:42,310
each Avenue that you travel down so I'll

212
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,949
give you some examples so I was working

213
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,229
with a project and I was requested to

214
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,450
review the white paper from a technical

215
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,660
aspect reviewing how blockchain is

216
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:55,270
implemented within this project funnily

217
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,630
enough all aspects of it was quite sound

218
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:02,500
though the blockchain aspect in specific

219
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:07,150
ethereum blockchain was implemented in a

220
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:09,310
way that I would be worried that the

221
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,280
project did not have a sound

222
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,680
understanding of how these things work

223
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,780
so there is limitation in knowledge

224
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,349
there was a Deloitte for example

225
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:22,480
research that indicated many people

226
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,510
thought they knew how a blockchain works

227
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,860
how these systems work and the more

228
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,900
people

229
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,630
- no the more damage it causes to the

230
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,850
entire ecosystem and then we have to pay

231
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,920
the price for it so a very common thing

232
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,230
that I get asked is like our Bitcoin is

233
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,329
not safe many people have lost money and

234
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,640
I have to reassure people that it is not

235
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,480
Bitcoin which is unsafe it is the users

236
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,910
that have built services on top of

237
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,550
Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies

238
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:54,040
so for example in Japan which was one of

239
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:58,089
the highest rated in percentage-wise a

240
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,250
Bitcoin in 2017 I believe and then it

241
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,900
went something from like 40 or 50

242
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,360
percent of all Bitcoin purchases were

243
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:08,260
done in Japanese yen - currently about 6

244
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,330
to 7 percent that's a huge difference so

245
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,490
when we say volatility we also have to

246
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,370
take into account all these events that

247
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,050
have occurred that have allowed

248
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,760
individuals to have the notion that

249
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,740
there is something wrong with it and

250
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,870
they are right in their way though again

251
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,930
it's not the network the network has

252
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,850
been operating flawlessly so these

253
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,199
services for example in Japan and

254
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,720
exchange got hacked

255
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,840
nem tokens half a billion dollars worth

256
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,050
were hacked there were warned previous

257
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,940
to this that there is a security issue

258
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:42,099
with the way that their exchange had

259
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,830
been set up though they didn't take into

260
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,780
consideration that warning and as a

261
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,570
result half a billion dollars were

262
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:52,089
stolen and imagine how many people were

263
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,250
impacted by that imagine how many

264
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,890
individuals walked away going well this

265
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,680
technology sucks half a billion dollars

266
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,290
is a significant amount of money so in

267
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,060
turn we have a responsibility to ensure

268
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,699
that the systems that we design are

269
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,329
tested thoroughly many people are eager

270
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,160
to introduce their projects or their

271
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,530
applications to the market without doing

272
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,770
their due diligence and making sure that

273
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:20,560
it's void of errors or at least doing a

274
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,270
group testing to overcome this so

275
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,689
there's very simple methods that you can

276
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,850
use to overcome these kind of issues

277
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:31,090
other aspects is wallets so for example

278
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,160
in Mexico I wanted to get a store to

279
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,950
accept Bitcoin cryptocurrencies and such

280
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,780
and I went through a list of wallis I

281
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,490
went through about five or six somewhere

282
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,060
close source though they worked quite

283
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,430
well

284
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,349
not a support of closed-source software

285
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:46,239
unless it really works really well like

286
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,520
Photoshop for example I don't have an

287
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,300
open-source alternative which can match

288
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:55,000
the functionality that Photoshop at

289
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,699
Adobe Illustrator provide though with

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,520
wallets we have many many different

291
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:06,880
types the issue is as said by the book

292
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,770
skin in the game we have tools that are

293
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,570
built by people who don't use the tools

294
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,689
an example which was used in the book

295
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:16,600
was that the train or the subway with in

296
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,360
New York was redesigned it originally

297
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,180
had a bit of a lip you could say that

298
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,770
people could place their coffee cups on

299
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,439
after the redesign this was put at a

300
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:29,199
slant a designer thought this might look

301
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,270
better an industrial designer which is

302
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,340
my background would understand that you

303
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,810
need to go for a ride on this train you

304
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:42,540
need to understand how people are

305
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:46,030
existing how people behave on that

306
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,500
specific mode of community so after the

307
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,120
redesign you could no longer place your

308
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,270
coffee cup there's it's a very small

309
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,040
issue though it occurs because you have

310
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,660
someone that designer that does not take

311
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,430
the train that did not understand the

312
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,069
benefit of having that space to place

313
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,839
your coffee cup with the Wallis the same

314
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,390
thing occurred so when I asked the store

315
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,400
owner to accept that is like which

316
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,500
wallet so I had to go through it I had

317
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,540
to test them as an end-user

318
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,280
and as a designer I go through it I'm

319
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,650
going all right there's limitations

320
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:18,160
within some some for example if the

321
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:20,319
store owner requests 20 pesos I send

322
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,900
that amount there's no message you know

323
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,940
something very simple like I this amount

324
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,680
has been received which the store owner

325
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,800
can then feel good about these are new

326
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,260
users they are afraid and if there's no

327
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,270
message they can be like what what

328
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,130
happened now and saying oh well go to

329
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,750
balance oh I know it's grayed out right

330
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,730
now and the amount doesn't show but if

331
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:43,210
you wait like 45 minutes and then check

332
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:45,070
it again it's gonna be great but that's

333
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,390
not very user friendly is it and he's

334
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,390
gonna be like what she's gonna be like

335
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,010
well I don't know the balance doesn't

336
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,569
show up what do you mean confirmation

337
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,710
and then you go into down these parts

338
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,650
you can avoid that whole

339
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,900
but having an application that simply

340
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,420
pops up and says hey amount receives an

341
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,850
application for example that I used was

342
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,500
not designed for landscape mode most of

343
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,930
the wallets that I tried were not the

344
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,990
only one I could get to use was coin ami

345
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,969
so that limitation also existed that a

346
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,770
store owner may use a tablet and it

347
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,350
might be in landscape mode so how do we

348
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,030
overcome these challenges is by taking

349
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,240
it account the people that are using it

350
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:24,910
is 2019 and we still don't have

351
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,830
functional applications that are up to

352
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,890
par with the needs that they are trying

353
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,690
to meet so I'm trying to find loopholes

354
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,150
and I'm trying to find these limitations

355
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,890
that are slowing down the progress of

356
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,410
cryptocurrency adoption cryptocurrency

357
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,540
awareness knowledge safety and the

358
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,360
ability for people to feel comfortable

359
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,750
using them and very simple tweaks can

360
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,210
challenge these or meet these challenges

361
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,220
so in Cyprus for example they have a

362
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:54,550
large community with cryptocurrencies in

363
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,170
Nicosia in specific and I was requested

364
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,640
by an organization and I thought it was

365
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,219
quite funny and this is like from a

366
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,650
corporate perspective an email was sent

367
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,170
out to a bunch of crypto related people

368
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:07,300
after they saw us I guess giving a

369
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,740
presentation there and the email was

370
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,659
like oh you know we are this huge

371
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,839
telecommunication company we would like

372
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,430
to invite you for lunch to help us come

373
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,869
up with some blockchain solution to get

374
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:21,070
the opinions and we'll give you free

375
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:24,250
lunch I was like okay that's interesting

376
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:25,990
so I looked into their history in 2016

377
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:29,110
they had made over 60 million dollars in

378
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:31,510
profit so I sent an email back going a

379
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,429
bit surprised that you have not allowed

380
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,950
the individuals who are participating in

381
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:38,260
this to be rewarded for their time you

382
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,500
had just offered free lunch even a food

383
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,510
research survey gives you something so

384
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,190
that gap again needs to be filled where

385
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,820
individuals are rewarded for their

386
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:52,720
knowledge and I found it quite insulting

387
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,399
to say the least Mexico so in Mexico a

388
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,350
lot of card payments are done through a

389
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,660
third party and they clicked four

390
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:01,270
percent on every transaction so this

391
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,610
again is an opportunity for you to bring

392
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,860
our cryptocurrencies but it needs to be

393
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,510
done in the whole process so for example

394
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,330
in a city called San Chris

395
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:13,720
doble a individual had come to this

396
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,899
store and said can you please accept -

397
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,080
and after some conversation

398
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,330
the store owner agreed the he had just

399
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,210
shown him how to download the wallet no

400
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,580
other process in place by the time I got

401
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,310
to him and saw it it was worth one tenth

402
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,230
of what it was originally it was a very

403
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:34,419
small amount though it leaves a bad

404
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,370
impression on the end-user or the store

405
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:40,060
owner because the person was just

406
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:42,340
fanatic about it except - but okay what

407
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,220
about the rest of the process so when I

408
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,139
went to him I said he's it exchange

409
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,420
called bit sir bit sir is a large

410
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,670
exchange in Mexico it allows you to

411
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:55,660
deposit Bitcoin and then transfer to

412
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:57,550
your bank account using see / and after

413
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,650
I showed him he was very excited because

414
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,740
I kept coming back and like you know

415
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,090
paying for things with Bitcoin and he

416
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,220
could just transfer it straight away to

417
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:09,310
his bank account he was so excited to be

418
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,260
able to do the whole process and those

419
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:14,260
are the kind of very small things that

420
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,140
we can do to overcome such challenges

421
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:20,440
just being aware that the end user may

422
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,630
not just want to use it to save that for

423
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,100
them it's a form of currency now for

424
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,710
them they need to put it into their bank

425
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,159
account so they can pay for things very

426
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,870
simple things so the damage of not

427
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,970
knowing and the damage of not taking

428
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,489
your time to understand the ecosystem is

429
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:39,220
quite profound in many ways and these

430
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,640
little bits and pieces can add up to

431
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,860
lead to a place where we are no longer

432
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,050
aware and there's a lot of issues and

433
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,679
bad negative thoughts towards

434
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,060
cryptocurrencies so that's with the

435
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,560
personal case some business cases you

436
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,690
need to understand which currencies to

437
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,330
use I don't try and push one usually you

438
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:01,090
know I say to use Bitcoin for the sake

439
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,460
that I know it's the longest-running one

440
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,770
I wouldn't suggest another one unless I

441
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,480
felt very comfortable or do you let the

442
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,660
store owner know of other options and

443
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,600
let them decide on top of that moving

444
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,330
forward other limitations exist within

445
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,939
software so this software which is open

446
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,040
source or this software which is closed

447
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,550
source and this is a very

448
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,320
or and part of this ecosystem and if you

449
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:31,840
look at it the main difference is either

450
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:35,139
you control the software or the software

451
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,949
controls you and that's a very simple

452
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,390
way to put it

453
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:44,110
kept ology is using persuasive a method

454
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:47,140
of persuasive sorry it's basic methods

455
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:49,389
within technology so the these are the

456
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,820
way that a closed source application

457
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:56,290
such as Facebook's such as instagrams

458
00:20:51,820 --> 00:21:00,040
such as Twitter get paid if something is

459
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:02,620
free it comes out of somewhere so I

460
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,450
would much rather as a user pay for our

461
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,520
application knowing that it's not

462
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,950
tracking me knowing that I have some

463
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,770
sort of a control rather than to do

464
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:14,110
something that's free which is taking

465
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:22,810
all my data and selling it to third

466
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:24,820
parties that I have no control over so

467
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,649
in the same manner a lot of the

468
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,669
knowledge that we have is because the

469
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:32,470
universe is not closed source a DNA is

470
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,120
able to be read so we can look at our

471
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,970
genome code we can look at a lot of

472
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,310
structures within nature and study them

473
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,250
it is because of these things that we

474
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:44,830
are able to progress and reach the

475
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,840
stages that we have so having something

476
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,399
the open source allows others to also

477
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,419
learn from it so I see a lot of

478
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,550
cryptocurrency projects that are aiming

479
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,750
to patent it and that's ok if you have

480
00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:00,190
the right reasoning though we exist in a

481
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,950
ecosystem that having it open allows

482
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:07,420
others to also have any input it's not

483
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:09,220
so much about having it open so the more

484
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,110
important aspect is allowing others to

485
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,570
contribute to it if you have a project

486
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,689
and your open source you make it open

487
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:18,310
source others around the world can also

488
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,870
review the code they can add to it they

489
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:22,210
can modify it and use it in ways that

490
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,330
you may have never thought about it adds

491
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:29,230
to your adoption it adds to your

492
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:30,939
application so no it's so the best way

493
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,270
to kind of achieve it is is to remain

494
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,840
fluid and to remain fluid you need to be

495
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,150
able to

496
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:41,139
create an application that can morph and

497
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:43,480
can change that if a certain time a new

498
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,220
regulation comes out it can morph with

499
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:51,190
it and move with it and these are very

500
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:54,220
very important things no words we can

501
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,120
skip it it's a video Bruce Lee saying be

502
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,730
water my friend

503
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,040
I'm sure you've all kind of seen it it's

504
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,720
quite old but it has a point when you

505
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,820
put water into a cup it becomes the cup

506
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,790
and in the same manner these

507
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,530
applications need to be able to morph to

508
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,389
the environment that they are going into

509
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:16,110
they need to be able to shift they need

510
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:19,450
to be able to you know change with time

511
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:21,879
so looking at these kind of issues and

512
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,740
having that vision where I want to reach

513
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,240
a point where we have decentralization

514
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,750
we have transparency we have

515
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,340
accountability and looking at the issues

516
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,060
that are limiting our ability to reach

517
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:36,370
there we then look at tools so the topic

518
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,010
of this conference or the event is

519
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:42,610
opt-out so for us to opt-out we need

520
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:46,510
tools a lot of these tools remain in

521
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:48,100
beta stage some in alpha some are being

522
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:54,010
developed and not even released to

523
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:56,230
public so the issue there is that we

524
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:59,080
need to find and support projects that

525
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:01,860
are aligned with the future vision so

526
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,870
I've been scanning for six years now

527
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:07,959
Bitcoin is great it has issues in my

528
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:10,449
opinion some of these issues is that it

529
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,540
requires outside investors to fund the

530
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,580
developers so because of this I'm not

531
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:18,250
questioning the integrity of the people

532
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,320
funding it I'm just merely saying that

533
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,780
by doing so you're introducing a

534
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,480
centralized point of access to that

535
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,580
project that someone with the fund could

536
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,720
have an ulterior motive that it could

537
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,439
lose the integrity that was set in

538
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,980
motion

539
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,560
upon its release so looking at these

540
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,920
projects I found decried and I quite

541
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:44,950
liked decrypt why first of all it was a

542
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,900
project that from the start

543
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,360
put a decentralized governance system

544
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,890
within itself

545
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,310
secondly it put a decentralized funding

546
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:57,820
system so why is this important it's

547
00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:00,040
important because if you have a project

548
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,560
which is self-funded and you have a

549
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,750
governance system external influence

550
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,960
becomes very limited the goals and

551
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,790
integrity remain much more secure so

552
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,410
decreed works in the way that it's sixty

553
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:15,760
thirty ten sixty percent of the

554
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:17,680
currencies go to the miners

555
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,930
thirty percent goes to the stakeholders

556
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,690
and ten percent goes to the

557
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:25,570
decentralized funding which then as a

558
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,490
community they can vote on how that fund

559
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,590
is being used so imagine if that was the

560
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,350
case with Bitcoin imagine ten percent of

561
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,600
all bitcoins that were mined went into a

562
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,790
decentralized fund to pay for

563
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,620
development to pay for marketing to pay

564
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:43,930
for whatever else traveling my events

565
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,209
and budgets and such wouldn't that

566
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:49,240
change the entire scope then we wouldn't

567
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,790
need to rely on third parties and it

568
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,070
would very much secure the decentralized

569
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:58,210
aspect a decentralized tool should be

570
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:59,679
exactly that decentralized other aspects

571
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,060
which are far enquired interesting is

572
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,980
that they built around decentralized

573
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:06,120
exchange they were the first ones to do

574
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,330
anatomic swap and it was launched in

575
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,820
2016

576
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:13,810
so it's fairly new but it's a project

577
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:16,149
that I find quite interesting so the

578
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:17,950
governance system is at its heart it is

579
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,260
a very very powerful system it allows

580
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:23,550
people to submit proposals it allows

581
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,780
people to vote on consensus changes and

582
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:28,180
what happens is that you as an

583
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,690
individual can go into the system called

584
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:34,780
palladium and submit a proposal so let's

585
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:36,250
say you have a idea you can just go on

586
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,129
there and be like this is my business

587
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,510
plan this is how much it costs this is

588
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,030
what I intend to do these are my

589
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,810
experiences and this is what I expect to

590
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,270
get out of it

591
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,250
you could be anywhere in the world if

592
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,170
you have the integrity you have the

593
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,870
knowledge you have the capability to do

594
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:57,700
so you can use the system to raise your

595
00:26:52,870 --> 00:27:00,070
funds to do it if you hold the credit

596
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,230
you also get a thing that they refer to

597
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:07,750
as a ticket which allows you to

598
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:09,910
on such things and have a say so overall

599
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,950
you can see the benefits of having an

600
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:14,680
internal governance system having

601
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,750
internal funding system that allows

602
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,920
individuals to incorporate ideas and

603
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:22,870
launch projects without needing to rely

604
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:28,630
on third parties without needing to rely

605
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:32,620
on external in payer investors recently

606
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:35,920
they also introduced a privacy protocol

607
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:40,629
based on coin shuffle it's a very simple

608
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:42,550
method that they implemented and the

609
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,470
code base is very very short

610
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:47,290
so less things can break it's much more

611
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,910
secure it allows people that buy the

612
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,720
tickets the rod now you need about I

613
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:54,760
think 120 it averages between 120 130 D

614
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,280
credits that you need to have a ticket

615
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,000
and by having a ticket you're rewarded

616
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:04,090
so after you submit your opinion or vote

617
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,390
on the matter or even handle it through

618
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:11,730
a pool you get your mount back and you

619
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:15,310
get a bid on top of it at the same time

620
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,920
with this privacy method those who

621
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:20,620
purchase tickets can remain anonymous

622
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:22,360
because imagine as a stakeholder you get

623
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,580
tracked down opinions can then be

624
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,350
manipulated so allowing people to

625
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,290
purchase tickets in a way that keeps

626
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,090
them private introduces another level of

627
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,220
integrity to the decentralized

628
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,740
governance and funding system and you

629
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,450
must protect that and later after

630
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,120
testing they may introduce the same

631
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,590
thing to transactions but first testing

632
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,820
needs to be done and that's very

633
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:47,860
important again you need to test systems

634
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,020
one in five is a mission and a project

635
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:53,679
that I'm personally a part of one in

636
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:56,680
five works with ITP and taught to relay

637
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:00,130
messages to bypass censorship in

638
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:03,700
countries such as China Iran Israel

639
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:05,890
North Korea even other countries which

640
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,280
we believe are open United States

641
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:11,230
Australia New Zealand for example in

642
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,620
Australia they introduced a law

643
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,169
requesting a backdoor into encryption

644
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,018
you can no longer call

645
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:21,659
encryption if you have a back door so

646
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:23,159
that started a lot of controversy so

647
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,980
we're heading towards a path where

648
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,899
applications are being modified to

649
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:31,470
remove the very protection that people

650
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:35,998
fought very hard to have through this

651
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:37,710
project hoping to overcome that hoping

652
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:39,869
to allow people to be able to relay

653
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,789
messages without the fear of censorship

654
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:44,158
without the fear being tracked down so

655
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:46,649
imagine you're journalists in a country

656
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,109
where speaking out can cost you your

657
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:50,789
life but then how do you do that

658
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:53,399
while having some sort of an identity

659
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:55,049
attached to it and allowing the message

660
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,350
to be relayed without you being put out

661
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:01,830
harm's way so by using such systems

662
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:03,959
relaying messages through i2p sorry just

663
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:08,699
I gauge it like put your hand up if you

664
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:13,109
know what I to PS all right it's less

665
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:15,960
than half about 20% let's say 20 30 % so

666
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:18,178
HP is a decentralized network the

667
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,049
difference we tore is that ITP is closed

668
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,659
from the cleaner

669
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:25,590
it requires proxy access which means

670
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:28,169
that you can't really shut it down it is

671
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,850
very powerful in being able to relay

672
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:33,299
messages so you can incorporate this

673
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:35,399
system within the 1m 5 protocol within

674
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,590
messaging applications within email

675
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:40,289
applications you can incorporate it

676
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:42,209
within blockchain wallets to be able to

677
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:44,759
relay transactions without it being

678
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:47,269
stopped it is very powerful for

679
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,429
journalists it is very powerful for

680
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:52,109
organizations that want to keep their

681
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:56,759
communication secure and away from

682
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:59,039
hackers this is how I could be using a

683
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,049
messaging application the beautiful

684
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,389
thing about this is that if you look at

685
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:07,168
the Hong Kong protests that recently

686
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:08,939
occurred telegram service with DDoS and

687
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:11,869
they were shut down that was the main

688
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,820
method of communication because we have

689
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:16,080
centralization it means that

690
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,489
organizations can get shot down and

691
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,230
whether that means through force of

692
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:22,470
government or it means through force of

693
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:24,149
ddossing these issues occur which means

694
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,539
people cannot communicate they can't

695
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:30,080
organize so allowing messages to be

696
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:32,929
relayed in a way that bypasses normal

697
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,689
a centralized service is very very

698
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:37,610
important telegram was a good step

699
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,769
forward from applications like whatsapp

700
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,990
and Facebook Messenger but we need

701
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:44,809
better tools we need tools that allow

702
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:46,870
individuals to communicate without fear

703
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:50,090
of these applications being shut down

704
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:53,959
especially in countries like China where

705
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:56,779
tor servers are almost all blocked so

706
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:00,500
having a way to go around that is quite

707
00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:02,990
important it is being incorporated

708
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,419
within a project called encrypt encrypt

709
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:08,080
is out of Harvard Business School it

710
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:10,940
aims to produce this as a way for

711
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,059
journalists organizations to relay

712
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:16,610
messages and store files and other sort

713
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:19,340
of information in a secure way and that

714
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:21,620
is a powerful thing in especially in

715
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,209
today's age where such freedoms are

716
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,559
being restricted more and more on a

717
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:29,919
daily basis it is a donation based

718
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,940
project we don't receive its you know

719
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,010
once you've registered something

720
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,809
somewhere and you get a bank account you

721
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:38,120
can very easily be tracked down you can

722
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:39,950
you can easily be shut down so allowing

723
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,439
it to be donation based such as the

724
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:46,130
decentralized exchange bisque which is

725
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,590
used for Bitcoin in the same manner

726
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,480
that's a decentralized autonomous

727
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:53,299
organization one in five remains is

728
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,450
decentralized autonomous mission which

729
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:59,440
means that it is out of physical

730
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:04,429
jurisdiction it exists purely on the

731
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:07,700
digital realm if you are a developer if

732
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:09,529
you are a person with access to or the

733
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,490
ability to be able to contribute somehow

734
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:16,820
please look it up if you like it that

735
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,679
would be really great I do have a little

736
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,120
bit more spare time so I do want to talk

737
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,750
about some of the experiences I've had

738
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:29,860
in Mexico how many of you know about the

739
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:32,750
Zapatista movement less than i2p

740
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,879
the Zapatista movement remains as one of

741
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,870
the most successful anarchist movements

742
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,740
in recent history

743
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:41,899
it started in 1994 as a way to protect

744
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,260
the indigenous culture within a state

745
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:46,530
called Chiapas

746
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:49,230
since then it has grown to include

747
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:51,600
between a hundred and fifty thousand to

748
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:53,490
three hundred thousand individuals who

749
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,219
are looking to protect their way of life

750
00:33:53,490 --> 00:34:00,059
because the way things were going the

751
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:03,059
Mayan culture and language was being

752
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:06,168
eradicated or at least not protected so

753
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:09,119
they stood up and they stood up against

754
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:13,080
military movements of Mexico a lot of

755
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,060
them sacrificed their own lives or he

756
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:20,609
was taken from them in a gruesome manner

757
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:22,350
but eventually they were able to take

758
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:24,779
control of their zone so it is an

759
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,149
absolute autonomous zone which means

760
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,070
they have nothing to do with the Mexican

761
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,750
government in any formal way when it

762
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:34,889
comes to healthcare when it comes to

763
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:38,429
hospital when it comes to education when

764
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:41,330
it comes to funding electricity all of

765
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:43,649
it and it is a very amazing movement to

766
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:46,799
experience so when you're in a city like

767
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:49,080
san cristobol you can go there and feel

768
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,419
the energy of it you can go to stores

769
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,310
and buy products that support them so

770
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:56,908
they produce coffee honey

771
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:59,279
chocolate tobacco and many other things

772
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:01,230
to support themselves they turn over

773
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,980
millions hundreds of millions dollars

774
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:06,510
their economy within itself is

775
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,630
independent and that is very very

776
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,400
powerful yet very few people he knew

777
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:14,160
about it and that's something that I

778
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,280
find interesting because this is a very

779
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,810
successful model yet not many people

780
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,060
know about it so I wanted to learn more

781
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:24,029
so I went and visited a university which

782
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:28,109
Noam Chomsky I'm sure all of you know

783
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:32,910
who Noam Chomsky's we regarded it as one

784
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:34,920
of the most holistic universities so I

785
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,960
wanted to know for myself what it's like

786
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,210
so I went and visited it I wanted to

787
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,100
know what they have to offer and upon

788
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,780
walking in very friendly people no

789
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,980
electricity from outside they have their

790
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,880
own huge generator within the

791
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,130
organization or within the space that

792
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,800
they have indigenous kids can go and

793
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,330
learn skills so this skills very you

794
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,800
walk through the place there's beautiful

795
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,848
music being played you don't feel like

796
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,470
you're in a university or

797
00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:01,410
least the ones that I'm used to it's

798
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,729
very colorful it's very fun so you walk

799
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,618
into one room and people are learning

800
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:05,848
how to play guitar learning about music

801
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,119
another room they're learning how to

802
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:11,999
make shoes another aspect of it is that

803
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,680
they have trucks lined up and you can go

804
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:18,720
and learn how to be a mechanic

805
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:22,288
you can go and learn how to use tools to

806
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,220
build fabric or learn about electrical

807
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:28,650
equipment it's very very application

808
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:32,009
based would work for example metalwork

809
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:34,349
it was very eye-opening for me imagine

810
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:37,079
all these individuals go out they can

811
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:39,210
always feed themselves somehow right you

812
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,420
given the tools to be able to enter

813
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,759
labor work on one form or another that

814
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,079
is very very valuable imagine you come

815
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:47,579
from a place where you don't even speak

816
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,039
Spanish some of them don't even speak

817
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:53,160
Spanish I found it really interesting

818
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,479
that there was areas where people would

819
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,220
be speaking and I'm like that's not

820
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:58,288
Spanish what language is that and they

821
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,598
would be speaking Mayan cities kada

822
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:02,160
stood up that group of people it allows

823
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,259
them to continue existing in their own

824
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,969
traditional way without having to adopt

825
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:07,979
in language or a way of life that was

826
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:09,660
forced on them it allows them to

827
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:14,819
preserve those aspects that are very

828
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:18,690
important for them this is a the guy in

829
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:20,880
san cristobol that i had a chat to and

830
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:26,400
got him to accept Bitcoin and I gave him

831
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:28,319
a pin to cheer him up he liked that yeah

832
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,529
and then he made this sign himself I

833
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:33,989
thought it was very sweet but I thought

834
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:35,960
to help him out so I redesigned it for

835
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:39,420
him to make it a bit more user friendly

836
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,549
and it also allows people to donate

837
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,769
without having to communicate with him

838
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:45,059
so that was an important aspect so this

839
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:46,589
wasn't so much for payment because

840
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:48,869
payments would be done through his phone

841
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:51,180
I put the QR codes there so if someone

842
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:53,099
is eating they can just tip him without

843
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,660
needing to communicate and I was an

844
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:56,819
extra benefit for me

845
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,529
so the Zapatista movement being in

846
00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:01,920
Mexico really opened my eyes to how

847
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:04,319
these tools can work so these systems

848
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,640
for example with deke red individuals in

849
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:07,200
these countries can come up with ways

850
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,049
that they can transform their monetary

851
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,830
system so unlike Europe which is pushing

852
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:15,480
to be

853
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:19,319
cashless Mexico operates 50% if not more

854
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,180
of Mexico operates on cash and that is

855
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,250
beautiful because you're dealing with an

856
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,680
economy that understand the risks of

857
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:27,600
banks it is the distrust that they have

858
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,049
towards the financial system that pushes

859
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,450
them to use cash and not put it in a

860
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:35,790
banking institution on the other aspects

861
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:39,180
due to poverty and low income a lot of

862
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:42,360
it a lot of the individuals do not find

863
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:44,759
it beneficial to put it in a bank

864
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,800
account that takes fees that may be

865
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:51,390
greater than what they have

866
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:55,040
so store of value is quite important so

867
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:57,118
there was a research done by a

868
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,890
organization and a friend of mine is a

869
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,990
part of it and they published it and

870
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:02,910
they saw that store ovalle was quite an

871
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:04,618
important thing in such a region as it

872
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,450
should be anywhere in the world really

873
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:09,630
because you are at the mercy of the

874
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:12,180
financial system and in 2008 we saw how

875
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,540
that could jeopardize individuals lives

876
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:19,618
and ability to have control over the

877
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:22,560
financial safety so store valley is very

878
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:25,290
important globally being able to have

879
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,480
being able to have a system that allows

880
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:31,470
you to take currency away from the

881
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:35,310
normal financial central back bank

882
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,959
backed systems is of great value so

883
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:42,600
showing individuals and educating them

884
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:45,200
on such topics is of importance other

885
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:49,410
things that are noticed is that in

886
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,618
Mexico because of these things people

887
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:54,899
are also very weary of new tools so not

888
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:57,359
all they not only are they weary of the

889
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,790
financial system but also if you come up

890
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,170
and say well here's a new system and

891
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,970
it's decentralized so I'll give you an

892
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,880
example for example I'll give you an

893
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:08,368
example in relation to san cristobol I

894
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,320
went and spent multiple hours speaking

895
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:11,670
to this guy I showed him the different

896
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,680
ways on how you can accept

897
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,600
cryptocurrency the benefits to hate for

898
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,359
him and how he can change it to cash

899
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,580
afterwards he said well what are you

900
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:22,950
getting out of this either

901
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,990
that's the old mentality I'm not getting

902
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,089
anything out of this

903
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,919
I just spent five hours with you I went

904
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,680
and paid for the science to be printed I

905
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,990
did all of this because I want to show

906
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,149
you that there's another way what I get

907
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,950
out of it is the happiness to know that

908
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,080
you are now an individual that has

909
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:42,700
access to a system that was not designed

910
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:45,319
by a central bank and that was a very

911
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:49,160
reflective moment for me that we live in

912
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,810
such a world where even in Netherlands I

913
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,180
had the same experience the individuals

914
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:54,290
thought are but we you know it's always

915
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,680
a thought what are you getting out of

916
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:58,970
this and I think decentralization and

917
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,279
the culture that comes with such

918
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:03,470
organizations such as parallel any place

919
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,910
such as crypto anarchists such as

920
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:08,299
individuals who are pushing to change

921
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:09,920
the realm that we're kind of in has

922
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,230
brought about a new notion which is

923
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,360
community based which is de strength in

924
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,640
numbers which was the original model of

925
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,040
Bitcoin right strength in numbers and

926
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,470
the more people we bring along and show

927
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,060
how do I overcome those limitations the

928
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:26,149
quicker we can reach that vision that I

929
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,500
put up at the start and by fixing and

930
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,940
tweaking these things whether it's in

931
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,410
your project by looking at how

932
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,690
blockchain is being used whether it's

933
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,609
necessary whether it's being applied in

934
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,470
the right manner and the data that is

935
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:38,270
being collected so that white paper for

936
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,740
example mentioned nothing about the

937
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,270
metadata being collected about the

938
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,399
individual safety in the body

939
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,619
individual's obligation the

940
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,500
organization's obligation it was the

941
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:50,359
first time after five or six years of

942
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,460
dealing with such projects that our

943
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:54,799
intellect entered another version of it

944
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,350
which was very centralized I couldn't

945
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,640
believe how much time I wasted dealing

946
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,500
with an organization that was so

947
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,839
centralized compared to all the other

948
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,820
projects that I worked with which things

949
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,100
get done very quickly in a decentralized

950
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,859
manner because you assign tasks and make

951
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,690
sure that people get it done and in a

952
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:13,819
centralized manner it's like you

953
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,560
interview and then go speak to the CTO

954
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:18,050
and then go speak to the CEO and then

955
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,060
they have to be like oh how do we know

956
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:22,520
what you're saying is right when an

957
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:25,070
individual thinks they know what's going

958
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,480
on so a project for example I had many

959
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:32,480
issues with because the founder had read

960
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:35,030
two books on blockchain and he designed

961
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,100
the system or thought or thought that he

962
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,970
could and I don't mean to like put him

963
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,348
down that's great

964
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:41,899
you know you felt comfortable and

965
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:44,030
confident to do so but that puts you at

966
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,099
risk your users at least a project at

967
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:48,290
risk and also the individuals you have

968
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,849
your obligation to make sure you assign

969
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:52,820
that to someone that knows what they're

970
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:56,180
doing and that is the problem with both

971
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:58,550
a start-up or founder having wanting to

972
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,098
have control over it and being able to

973
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:04,340
in some ways delegate that task to

974
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:06,980
someone that knows it better so those

975
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:09,650
are some of my experiences and I guess

976
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,150
overall I want us to work on these

977
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,040
issues that we can reach the future

978
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,980
vision I want us to understand our

979
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,080
obligation and responsibilities a bit

980
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,450
better and be able to work with

981
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,940
organizations to help them implement

982
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:25,339
these within their projects and overcome

983
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,859
whatever issues or limitations they have

984
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,450
so thank you for coming here it's been a

985
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:32,810
great honor to speak here for half a

986
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:36,200
decade and I just want to say that it's

987
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:37,910
not as cool and I've always loved coming

988
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,589
to peril any place that I hope to

989
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,790
continue coming because it's one of the

990
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,770
only places in the world

991
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:44,720
honestly that I've been to that still

992
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:47,009
portrays the true principles of what all

993
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:54,339
of this meant to begin with thank you

994
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:54,340
[Applause]

995
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:59,630
thank you I mean for sharing with us and

996
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:08,089
we have I think we have five minutes so

997
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:09,800
we can do two questions I saw one I just

998
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:11,570
want to thank you for coming every year

999
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,760
it's my third year here it's your third

1000
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:16,520
year here part of the reason why I come

1001
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,730
back is because of you the first year I

1002
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,259
remember there were ice baths and micro

1003
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:24,560
dosing all kinds of different things

1004
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,990
second year was you know more open and

1005
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,690
this third year what do you think the

1006
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:31,848
next few years will bring and I'm not

1007
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,070
just talking crypto here I'm talking

1008
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:36,589
just freedom and liberty what do you

1009
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:38,780
think the next few years will bring what

1010
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:39,619
are you gonna talk about next year yeah

1011
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,619
yeah

1012
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:45,920
tough one no no it's good one and it's

1013
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:47,690
all fun I guess at the moment in

1014
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,210
relation to the previous years where I

1015
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,160
came I had been exploring bio hiking so

1016
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:54,070
I had darkness ever

1017
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,930
they fast for example water fast during

1018
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:58,330
that time while I was away in Cyprus I

1019
00:44:55,930 --> 00:45:03,040
tried to 48 hour drive faster no food or

1020
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:04,690
water that was interesting a pond on top

1021
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,910
of that you know I did the cold training

1022
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:10,240
so sitting in a frozen lake I live in

1023
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:14,259
Mexico now so it's kind of hard but I do

1024
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:17,020
my best and I'm working with the Rings

1025
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,670
this sounds weird but my aim for the

1026
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,350
next three or four months I've been

1027
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:22,930
working on it for nearly a year is to do

1028
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:24,640
the Iron Cross on the Rings it's just

1029
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:26,259
pushing my own boundaries and by doing

1030
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,960
so it allows me to have a greatest go

1031
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:32,290
upon life itself I'm very close to being

1032
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,750
able to do that in terms of Liberty in

1033
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,220
terms of technology it's changing we all

1034
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:39,040
know it's changing the culture has

1035
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,870
changed River a Stickley many of the

1036
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,450
aspects of it is no longer

1037
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:45,609
representative of the original ideas and

1038
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:47,140
that's ok things change right and we

1039
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,970
have to be able to be okay with it and

1040
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:51,100
move with it so even for myself I deal

1041
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:53,410
with a lot of hardship in that way where

1042
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:57,850
I'm trying to figure out how to move

1043
00:45:53,410 --> 00:46:00,430
with it so I think a friend of mine said

1044
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:03,279
most of the for example privacy based

1045
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:05,440
coins are being delisted of exchanges so

1046
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,140
this is occurring globally it is being

1047
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,910
put into the dark space you know so by

1048
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:13,690
doing so you're also forcing all these

1049
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:16,960
currencies to go into the dark net let's

1050
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:19,750
say the application of them become more

1051
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,480
prominent in such a way on the other

1052
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,970
side it also pushes for people to bring

1053
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,930
about more decentralized forms of

1054
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:31,750
exchange and distribution so a greater

1055
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:33,850
push for decentralized exchanges and a

1056
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,260
greater push for decentralized systems

1057
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:37,950
that can be shut down like for example

1058
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:40,450
bisk again is a decentralized autonomous

1059
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:43,629
organization at Dow it allows people to

1060
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:45,009
trade Bitcoin for Amazon cards or you

1061
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:47,530
know the whole scope of things that

1062
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:49,630
local Bitcoin does buy in a

1063
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:52,390
decentralized way in a way that doesn't

1064
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:54,790
give away your information your identity

1065
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:56,529
and all of that so I see two very

1066
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:58,390
powerful sides one is that the

1067
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,980
corporations having the taken over the

1068
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:02,080
scene and they refer to it as

1069
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:03,640
distributed ledger technology and it's

1070
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,230
become a marketing tool that's embedded

1071
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,589
within so many application

1072
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:10,210
that very rarely need them a lot of

1073
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:12,190
people don't understand that we make it

1074
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,869
private blockchain you lose a lot of the

1075
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:16,180
powers that were given to you it's just

1076
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:18,910
it's absurd in many ways and I'm not

1077
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:21,190
even interested in them on the other

1078
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:22,750
side this huge movement of sharing

1079
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:25,150
economy there's a huge movement of

1080
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:28,030
decentralization and I think that's kind

1081
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:30,550
of opposing it and I think that will be

1082
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:32,290
the battle and I don't know we'll see

1083
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,520
I'll give you an example in Australia

1084
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,290
there's a group of people who through

1085
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,020
snapchat started distributing

1086
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:40,390
information news it now has two million

1087
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,130
members and news networks are getting

1088
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:44,020
very worried that police have come out

1089
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,790
and said leave this to us leave it to

1090
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,140
the professionals stay out of this but

1091
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:50,410
you can't compete with two million

1092
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,900
people relaying news you know and giving

1093
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:54,819
photos and opinions I'm like that that

1094
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,820
duck for me is so disruptive that I love

1095
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:01,060
it so yeah that's just a few examples of

1096
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,390
my thoughts cheers my thanks for coming

1097
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:07,180
over

1098
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:09,279
yes just just a quick question so and

1099
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:12,190
thanks for that for the talk what's your

1100
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:17,560
definition of decentralization a lot of

1101
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:19,720
confusion in the space Oh curiously are

1102
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:22,570
your thoughts on that and well yeah your

1103
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,640
your definition of decentralization my

1104
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:26,680
definition of decentralization if we

1105
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,339
were like as an organization as an

1106
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:32,290
application no how do you just define

1107
00:48:30,339 --> 00:48:35,830
the term philosophically Oh

1108
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:37,359
centralization what does it mean to you

1109
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,660
because you've clearly talked about that

1110
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,810
a lot

1111
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:44,560
sure sure for me and I mean if you have

1112
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:47,290
one minute okay so yeah all right for me

1113
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,330
it's the ability to have people voice

1114
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:51,430
their opinions it's the ability to have

1115
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:53,980
transparency in the way that as an

1116
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,169
organisation or application decisions

1117
00:48:53,980 --> 00:49:00,130
are made how people collaborate how

1118
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:02,530
individuals produce results the best

1119
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:04,510
example I can give you is nature nature

1120
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:06,550
itself is decentralized your entire body

1121
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,869
is decentralized the way your cells and

1122
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:10,240
everything else functions in your body

1123
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:12,520
is in a very decentralized way so it is

1124
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,680
representative of nature and anything

1125
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,290
that is not representative nature will

1126
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,520
require third-party input so it's like

1127
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:20,560
your blood cells for

1128
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,850
example requesting access from someone

1129
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:25,240
that's not in your body and what they

1130
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:28,029
should do such a thing doesn't occur so

1131
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:30,689
for me it's that autonomy representation

1132
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:34,420
of nature is the best way I can put it

1133
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:36,550
thank you cheers guys thank you thank

1134
