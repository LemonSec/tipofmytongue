1
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:33,710
okay so welcome everybody here on the

2
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,770
third stage of hacking Congress para una

3
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,440
polish 2019 I'm very happy that you

4
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,640
stayed with us here in Institute of

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,269
cryptology and

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,840
I'm very proud that I can introduce and

7
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,820
welcome here on a stage marketed Alicia

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,220
market is a design researcher with a

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,510
background in human-computer interaction

10
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,339
and food studies

11
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,470
I think the food studies will be

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,540
something very important here and you

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,089
already see a little of broccoli behind

14
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,879
me her research combines the method of

15
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:06,530
techniques of research through design of

16

practices she's a co-founder of several

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,539
independent design research collectives

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,100

interaction so marquita floor is yours

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,880
thank you for coming

30
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:50,640
so yes thank you everyone for staying

31
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,789
here for this slightly off-topic talk

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,920
maybe as it can seem at the first side

33
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:57,990
and thank you for having me so I'm going

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,729
to talk today about the paradoxes of

35
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,009
personalized nutrition and Diet hacking

36
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,469
which was research that I did as part of

37
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,630
my PhD at the National University of

38
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,628
Singapore and just to give you a little

39
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,930
bit of context although Michael already

40
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:14,640
did what do I do so I frame my research

41
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,069
within the field of human food

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,869
interaction which is a smaller sub

43
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,060
discipline of a larger field called

44
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,579
human-computer interaction HCI which you

45
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,890
might be familiar with and what we do in

46
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:27,870
HFI is we look at the growing and

47
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,420
uncertain role of digital and bio

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,310
technologies in human food practices so

49
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,839
in the everyday practices around eating

50
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,370
cooking diet planning growing food etc

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,829
so why food right why should we bother

52
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,870
or maybe you buy do I bother about food

53
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,060
I think this is very common sense but

54
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,310
while food is a fundamental thing it is

55
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,370
a part of everyday life for the most of

56
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,739
us I guess everyone has some experience

57
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,139
with some food it is a source of joy and

58
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,389
pleasure but it is also increasingly a

59
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,010
problem and you're probably familiar

60
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,500
with some of these problems

61
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,078
such a small nutrition or the

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,470
unsustainability of our food consumption

63
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:09,810
and production or the insecurity which

64
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,970
relates to the unequal access among

65
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,299
socio-economic classes to healthy and

66
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,370
safe food so these problems similar as

67
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,790
many other social problems in the last

68
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,709
decade became of like object of interest

69
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,160
of the entrepreneurs from the

70
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,840
technological innovation centers usually

71
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,709
centered around Silicon Valley and

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,079
places like that who started suggesting

73
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,510
and developing all kinds of solutions to

74
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:40,829
simplify our food practices and solve

75
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,910
these cumbersome global food problems ok

76
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,230
now we have a black code

77
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,230
yeah another black OH

78
00:03:47,430 --> 00:04:08,320
sorry yeah should be fine um it's not

79
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:10,149
really fine yeah okay so there is a

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,380
great variety of these food techno

81
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,970
solutions ranging from technologies for

82
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,180
personalized nutrition such as nutrition

83
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,860
trekkers all kinds of variables services

84
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,710
that offer you to personalize your diet

85
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,100
based on your DNA to smart kitchen very

86
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:30,789
tools such as smart or intelligent ovens

87
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,980
bottle kettles or fridges to all kinds

88
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,090
of by hacked food supplements we had

89
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,090
self biohacking

90
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,340
panel down in the other room right now

91
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,560
just right right now so people talk

92
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,500
about it already we have all kinds of

93
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,240
foods that are developed to enhance our

94
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:52,750
physique or our cognitive capabilities

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:05:05,190
and I'm just having huge black out all

96
00:04:52,750 --> 00:05:08,830
the time okay so this is not new right

97
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,810
this idea of solving social issues in

98
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,300
the food context is not coming out of

99
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:18,100
the blue it is part of this larger wave

100
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:20,320
of neoliberal technology termination

101
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,070
that the wave started in early 90s

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,230
around the technological centers such as

103
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:29,730
Silicon Valley that was promising that

104
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,930
social issues and problems can be fixed

105
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,210
through purely technological

106
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,460
interventions and while these

107
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,070
initiatives and efforts have been

108
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,590
glorified to some extent some people

109
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,140
have also raised certain critic against

110
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,950
such efforts one of the most vocal

111
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,349
critics is yogini more Asif who is a

112
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,229
political scientist from Ukraine that

113
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:56,229
post reminding us in 2013 that this

114
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,210
techno solution ism as he calls it might

115
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,050
create a lot of unintended consequences

116
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,539
and race

117
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:05,319
and issues so instead of solving

118
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:08,169
problems these techno solutions might

119
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,849
actually create even more problems and

120
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,190
we know that right we talked about it

121
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:14,680
quite often we are aware of these

122
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,590
unintended consequences we are aware of

123
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,330
the potential risks for us and we are

124
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,888
sort of afraid of them very often but

125
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,859
this is not my place to talk about this

126
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:27,580
in detail I'm using it here more as a

127
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,830
context for my own research or what

128
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,590
motivates my own research in the food

129
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,479
context which is looking at the thin

130
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,388
line between food technology innovation

131
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,280
and food technology ISM so the

132
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,740
opportunities but also limitations and

133
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,888
risks that new technologies bring into

134
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,050
our everyday food practices and as I

135
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,060
hinted at the beginning I'm going to

136
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,550
talk about personalized nutrition which

137
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,550
is a smaller scope of food technologies

138
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,219
that are available on the market so what

139
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,340
is personalized nutrition to say it very

140
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:03,490
simply it is the idea of adapting food

141
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,940
to our personal needs and preferences

142
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,130
which might entail personalizing our

143
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,080
diet according to our lifestyle

144
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,500
preferences such as you know I want to

145
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,240
be vegan because for ethical reasons so

146
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,729
I want to personalize my diet in a way

147
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,389
that I will exclude any animal protein

148
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:23,919
or according to our biological

149
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:26,889
determinants such as our DNA or our

150
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:31,389
metabolic traits which is something that

151
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:34,150
I will talk about a bit later but in

152
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:36,520
general the central claim the central

153
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,568
idea of personalized nutrition is that

154
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:47,500
the one-size-fits-all

155
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:50,050
Dietary Guidelines the Dietary

156
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,840
Guidelines are issued by the food

157
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,460
authorities food and health authorities

158
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,948
such as the food pyramids and all kinds

159
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,258
of plates that suggest that everyone

160
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:01,539
should eat the same everyone should have

161
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:04,120
the same amount of calories and the same

162
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:07,479
composition on nutrition of nutrients on

163
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,580
their plates is obsolete and we would be

164
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,820
better if we eat according to our

165
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,140
specific personal traits

166
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,640
and just to give you a little bit of

167
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,860
overview of what kind of technologies

168
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,599
are actually available in the market

169
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,220
these days there are all kinds of

170
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,950
nutrition trackers and diet logging

171
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,740
systems which help you to track what you

172
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:28,349
eat count your calories count your

173
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,080
metabolic responses to your food suggest

174
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,330
all kinds of food products and food

175
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,909
items that are specifically tailored to

176
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,770
your preferences there are also

177
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,469
so-called nutrigenomics and nutria

178
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:43,319
genetics diets which basically require

179
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,600
you to submit your biological samples

180
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,880
such as for instance saliva to some

181
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,760
corporate laboratory where they analyze

182
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,370
your DNA and send you back the analyze

183
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,430
DNA and ID recommendation so what should

184
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,440
you eat to feed your genes the same

185
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,620
thing works in the context of microbiome

186
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,260
based diet where you send another type

187
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,680
of biological samples most often your

188
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,569
feces and you get your feces decoded and

189
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,359
you get your diet recommendations to eat

190
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:19,530
to feed your microbes in your guts so

191
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:23,850
sort of build your gut garden and then

192
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:27,089
we have last but not least this category

193
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,630
of personalized food products and

194
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,450
supplements where directly the food is

195
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:36,170
personalized such as like these vitamins

196
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:40,530
that are 3d printed and personalized

197
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:43,800
according to your blood glucose or the

198
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,290
food replacement so I learned one of the

199
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,089
complete foods products that this is

200
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,089
kind of popular popular on the market

201
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,460
these days or the personalized nest leti

202
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,920
which is basically customized to your

203
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,320
DNA so you can drink tea that is based

204
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,880
on your DNA so as you can see there are

205
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,970
many personalized nutrition's

206
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,170
and many promises that they make the

207
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:08,460
central promise though

208
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,410
is that you can be empowered when you

209
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,180
eat personalized food you can get

210
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,219
control of your diet you can get control

211

control of your life right I really like

213
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,930
those claims that I just like screenshot

214
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,390
it from some of the websites of the

215
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,920
companies such as you know be the master

216
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,270
of your health

217

personalize your diet be the best

218
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,220
version of yourself possible through

219
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,890
personalizing your diet so these are

220
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,230
like very very empowering and very

221
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:41,680
ambitious claims of what personalized

222
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:45,340
nutrition can do to us and all this

223
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,219
motivated my curiosity was feeding my

224
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,140
curiosity in learning something more

225
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,540
about personalized nutrition so I was

226
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,740
quite interested in how does

227
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,199
personalized nutrition fit into the

228
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,760
everyday food lifestyles of people how

229
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,980
do you actually perform it in the

230
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,590
everyday context what advantages and

231
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:07,180
challenges does it afford to its users

232
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:09,160
and who does that and why so this

233
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,949
motivated my first research study that

234
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,219
I'm going to introduce here today which

235
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:19,320
was a study of complete foods you might

236
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,320
not complete foods under different name

237
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,429
[Music]

238
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:29,949
you might know it as Soylent which is

239
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:32,560
sort of more popular name for this kind

240
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:35,140
of products so Solon was the first

241
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,680
complete food available on the market in

242
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,510
2013 it was introduced as a powdered

243
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,459
food replacement that is supposed to

244
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,650
contain all essential nutrients that the

245
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,990
human body needs to stay healthy and

246
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,990
thrive it was introduced by a young

247
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,520
software engineer Robert Reinhart who

248
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,800
kind of claimed that he's you know tired

249
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,380
and bored with all the hassle around

250
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,510
food like cooking eating and thinking

251
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,840
about what to eat to be healthy so what

252
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:04,150
he did is he took the USDA Dietary

253
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,210
Guidelines for Americans and he

254
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,590
translated them into a powder mix so

255
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,200
what he did is he took all the

256
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,660
proportions of you know your

257
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,310
carbohydrates and fats and

258
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,969
micronutrients and he found powdered

259
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,530
substances mix them together and

260
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,840
basically like embodied the drafting

261
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,640
guidelines in a powder and he did the

262
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,880
self experiment of drinking the powder

263
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,460
in the form of shake for 30 days and

264
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,530
then he reported other results on the

265
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,320
Internet in his book post called how I

266
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:37,390
stopped eating food and it was awesome

267
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,740
right he was saying like my hair is

268
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,860
shiny

269
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,160
my skin is glowing I lost weight I'm

270
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,480
totally smart now sings like that so

271
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,540
obviously it attracted a lot of

272
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,630
attention he got some funding through

273
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,689
some crowdfunding campaign and also from

274
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,850
the Silicon Valley NGO investors so even

275
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:00,520
she raised a lot of money and managed to

276
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,529
open a startup called Trostle apps and

277
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,140
started producing and distributing his

278
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,370
powder commercially but what is

279
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,649
important for us and what was

280
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,899
interesting for me when I was looking

281
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:13,540
into this was that he also claimed that

282
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:16,149
his powder is open source meaning that

283
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,430
he shared his formula his recipe online

284
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:19,959
and said look you can tweak it do

285
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,120
anything you want with it

286
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,829
I want to you know this is not fixed

287
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,839
this is just open to the world you can

288
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,390
play with it and customize it to your

289
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,550
own needs and people started doing it

290
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,410
quite quickly quite quickly there

291
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,050
emerged this large community of soil and

292
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,360
di wires as they call themselves who

293
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,250
started experimenting and creating new

294
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,450
powders according to their own

295
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:46,300
preferences local powders high protein

296
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,980
content powders vegan powders etc and

297
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,959
some of them eventually started selling

298
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,970
their powders commercially which in 2019

299
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,520
resulted in kind of a huge global

300
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,339
complete foods market where we have over

301
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,730
55 commercial brands selling their

302
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:05,950
powders today but the commercial

303
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,079
destroys are not so interesting for me

304
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,209
to be honest I was really intrigued by

305
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,149
this DIY community of people who start

306
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,189
eating powders and experimenting wisdom

307
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:17,589
you know buying all kinds of ingredients

308
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,020
mixing and mixing the mixing them

309
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:22,630
together and trying to figure out some

310
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,520
kind of balanced meal for themselves

311
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,470
according to their own preferences so

312
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,970
sort of playing some kind of nutrient

313
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:33,610
puzzles trying to be healthy and be the

314
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,920
best version of themselves and for this

315
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,709
kind of geeking they also established

316
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,020
three discussion forums one is called

317
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:43,899
discourse at Soylent second was a

318
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,360
subreddit forum and third was developed

319
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:48,790
by one of the really enthusiastic soil

320
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,459
and DIY arsenic Pollan who created this

321
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,800
forum called complete food CEO where

322
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,380
people actually

323
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,020
their recipes like the full recipes of

324
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:01,140
their customized powders so this is

325
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:04,140
example of one set recipe based on the

326
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,240
original Soylent one called keto ciao so

327
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,819
it is ketogenic right so you can see

328
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,900
that it has as the most like important

329
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,730
ingredients some protein powder and then

330
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,970
as a source of fat some heavy whipping

331
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,670
cream there was also a bunch of organic

332
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,589
powders solid powders people trying you

333
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,229
know to bake cookies from their pounders

334
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:27,510
although like trying to get super humans

335
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:30,570
through their powders I think no tropics

336
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:36,410
such as promenade septum or no Apep

337
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:36,410
etcetera and this is another blackout

338
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:45,480
and this is like my little thing that I

339
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,310
did with my co-author then he saw where

340
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,440
we tried to create so I went recipe

341
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,510
based on our DNA so he kind of connected

342
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,630
the two things together we got our DNA

343
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:57,660
decoded and we tried to design silent

344
00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:01,200
recipe that would really fit to DNA of

345
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:03,719
each of us so as you can see from the

346
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,600
first idea of like one powder fits all

347
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,730
Robert Reinhardt saying listen this is

348
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,410
USDA guidelines translated into powder

349
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,750
and you can drink it and be healthy

350
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,719
Soylent became like this complete food

351
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:18,089
community became this great area for

352
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,430
picky eaters experimenting with all

353
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:23,250
kinds of personalized nutrition products

354
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:25,229
and recipes where you know the sky is

355
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,880
the limit like basically people started

356
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:30,150
making powders out of pretty much

357
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,390
everything and so that is the background

358
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:37,470
of my study of this community which I

359
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:39,959
started in 2014 and it in 2017 it was

360
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,050
done mostly in Europe North America and

361
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:46,079
Asia Pacific countries what I did is

362
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:49,140
that I interviewed 65 people 40 of those

363
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,529
30 hires who are active mostly in the

364
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,600
first years of this whole phenomenon

365
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,770
eighteen of them where owners of some

366
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,610
kind of commercial distribution

367
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:01,560
commercial company selling their powders

368
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,150
one of them was also Robert Reinhardt

369
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,349
the original founders so I interviewed

370
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,779
him as well

371
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:10,719
Andres / customers people ordering from

372
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:13,630
one of those distributors right I also

373
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,059
did content analyzes of the three online

374
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,789
forums just to see what people are

375
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:21,819
talking about there what kind of ideas

376
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:23,349
are exchanging and then I organized a

377
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,720
bunch of workshops where we were playing

378
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:28,689
with the powders one of the workshop was

379
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,380
actually organized here in the second

380
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:35,230
floor in Paris and I also conduct itself

381
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,379
experiment where I probe the powders on

382
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:42,159
myself so I designed my own formula and

383
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:44,649
for two one-month long periods I was

384
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:46,450
only eating my powder and I did it

385
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:48,549
mostly because I wanted to know what I'm

386
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,519
talking about right so I developed this

387
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:52,929
interest in this community and I didn't

388
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,809
want to be one of those researchers who

389
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:57,279
just looks at some subject from a

390
00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:01,059
distance and doesn't have like

391
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,799
first-hand experience and what I was

392
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,559
interested in were the motivations and

393
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,960
experiences of people eating complete

394
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,750
foods and also the limits and advantages

395
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,309
of this diet so here in the next few

396
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,250
minutes I'm going to talk mostly about

397
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:16,870
the findings from the interviews because

398
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:21,279
these eventually turn out to be the most

399
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:23,590
like important so the motivations most

400
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:28,480
of the motivations revolved around that

401
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:31,000
sort of confusion and distrust with food

402
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,129
what food is today many people are

403
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,649
saying things like oh well I feel

404
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:38,168
overwhelmed by the volume of misleading

405
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:41,289
information that is provided about food

406
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:44,230
you know by big food brands and also by

407
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:47,350
governments some participants were

408
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,559
highly skeptical about the official

409
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:52,330
Dietary Guidelines in Europe or in u.s.

410
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,340
that are developed into

411
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,649
one-size-fits-all model so most of the

412
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,370
people used those guidelines but they

413
00:18:56,649 --> 00:19:02,229
used them only as a baseline for their

414
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:10,299
own self experimentation their own

415
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:14,230
tweaking basically or diet hacking and

416
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:15,129
this was interesting because that sort

417
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,440
of

418
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,529
frustration with what food is how much

419
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,700
do people not understand what food is

420
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:24,279
and how much do they sort of want to

421
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,269
escape from it let's do this weird thing

422
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:29,649
where those people are deliberately

423
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:32,669
abandoning what food is with all its

424
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:35,168
social and gastronomical aspects and

425
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:36,940
streamlining it into powder that pretty

426
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:39,070
much doesn't have any taste or at least

427
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,250
it didn't at the beginning of this whole

428
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,960
Soylent era so as one participant

429
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,460
mentioned well Soylent helps me you know

430
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,129
to differentiate between food and

431
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,799
nutrition so these are no longer the

432
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:52,870
same things nutrition is a stuff the

433
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,149
default stuff did my body runs on and

434
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,860
food is the fun part food is something

435
00:19:55,149 --> 00:20:01,149
that I do occasionally like a festive

436
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:04,360
thing so complete food for many people

437
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:07,059
was a way how to quote escape the

438
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,850
vicious cycle of crappy foods all around

439
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:12,700
to basically opt out from the system of

440
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:16,600
mass food production and standardized

441
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:19,450
food recommendation the participants

442
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,100
were also often saying that well you

443
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,019
know I trust myself much more than

444
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:27,279
anybody else I don't really care of what

445
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:30,669
some a health expert says I really care

446
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:34,000
about how my body reacts to what I eat

447
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:36,610
and there was this huge notion of self

448
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,039
trust believing in yourself rather than

449
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,600
some external system and that was

450
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,580
curious to me because most of these

451
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,610
people are hobbyists right there are

452
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:47,080
experimenters but they are not they

453
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,809
don't have some kind of education in

454
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,029
nutrition or food so I was curious in it

455
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:55,870
how is it scaffolded how this self Trust

456
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:58,629
is built in scaffolded and it was quite

457
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,610
interesting for me to learn that through

458
00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:03,269
this self experiment

459
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,500
probing of diets people aren't a lot

460
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:08,259
most of them claim that you know I

461
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,629
definitely know much more about food and

462
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:13,269
nutrition since I started eating powder

463
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:15,428
since I started you know tweaking it

464
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:18,039
playing with it customizing the powder

465
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:21,940
formula and seeing what kind of thing

466
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:24,100
does it do to my to my body so it's one

467
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,899
participant mentioned you know it is the

468
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,299
same thing as if you have technology you

469
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:30,549
need to understand by yourself

470
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:32,349
like it's not your place to consume only

471
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:34,179
what is out there for you you can trust

472
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:35,830
it you need to build it by yourself and

473
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:39,129
it's the same as food you need to open

474
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:42,428
the black box of food yourself and you

475
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:44,109
know understand it by yourself in this

476
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:46,479
regard very important was the online

477
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:49,749
community gathered at the 3 D forums

478
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:51,519
which I mentioned before the forums are

479
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:54,549
very active in terms of people sharing

480
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,469
their experiences sharing their ideas

481
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:59,229
about food sharing your self tracking

482
00:21:56,469 --> 00:22:01,029
sheets as well so locks of their

483
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:04,149
metabolic data how do they react to

484
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:06,159
different powders what kind of bad or

485
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:11,018
good experiences they had with different

486
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:14,129
nutrient compositions etc so the forum's

487
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:16,299
were very important for this self trust

488
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:17,859
building where the people are saying

489
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:20,379
well you know this is very important

490
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:22,899
because we as no nutritionist suddenly

491
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:27,519
can discuss the effects whatever that is

492
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:29,768
and strike on our own but for me as sort

493
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:33,070
of nutrition hobbyist by myself at that

494
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:35,200
time um most kind of you know I was

495
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,869
using the forums as well I was using the

496
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,429
DIY forum to design my own DIY Soylent

497
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:40,570
formula because I didn't really know how

498
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:42,639
to do it by myself

499
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,769
I was looking at the discussions I was

500
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:47,199
asking questions seeking for help from

501
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:50,559
others but I was constantly worried with

502
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,570
the sink of can I trust these people you

503
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,219
know you don't know them some people

504
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,649
strangers online who are recommending

505
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:59,019
Cuba to eat and whatnot so I was asking

506
00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:01,478
about that as well during the interviews

507
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:03,820
and there was this recurrent motif again

508
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:05,889
that you know whatever

509
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,899
I trust the community much more because

510
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:10,508
we are like-minded people who are

511
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:13,208
dedicated to self experimentation and I

512
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:15,009
trust it much more than some health

513
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:17,919
experts because they probably have some

514
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:26,379
hidden agendas or health corporations

515
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:30,129
right there were even there were even

516
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:33,539
some sort of not totally far-fetched for

517
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:37,119
me it was quite interesting ideas about

518
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:40,029
complete food as a start of some kind of

519
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,919
citizen science experiment this group of

520
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:44,470
enthusiasts and people hacking

521
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,840
it's experimenting with their bodies can

522
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,550
actually be quite useful if you think

523
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,669
about it for the whole nutrition science

524
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,830
right because we are very limited now in

525
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:56,140
terms of testing for various nutrients

526
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,060
and various diets because clinical

527
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,910
trials are a terribly expensive

528
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,850
and take super long time so these people

529
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:05,680
are suggesting that you know we kind of

530
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:09,580
do that on our own so if we somehow

531
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:11,830
manage to build some system to

532
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:14,260
systematize the way how we report our

533
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,659
findings systematize the way how we

534
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:19,300
discuss our issues have some protocols

535
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,130
for soft self testing for instance that

536
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,020
would actually be quite useful and we

537
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:26,050
can actually try to do some sort of

538
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:29,530
decent science here which was great on

539
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:32,440
the other hand that never happened there

540
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,000
were some people this is a post the

541
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,650
picture from some PhD student from

542
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,170
Washington University who posted in the

543
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,400
forum saying that oh you know I was

544
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,230
thinking about that that you are

545
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,120
discussing this you are discussing this

546
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,070
issue here in this forum so I designed

547
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,620
this platform for self experimentation

548
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:50,379
where you can start comparing results

549
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,270
you can start trying to build some kind

550
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,210
of protocol or working on some protocol

551
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:57,940
on how to report your results and turn

552
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,400
it into something systematic it never

553
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:04,750
happened it's just state within the you

554
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:08,500
know chitchat in the forum so that's

555
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:11,140
sort of even more amplified my curiosity

556
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,990
about how do these people treat the

557
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:17,140
risks in this diet because the diet

558
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,970
after all is not confirmed by any

559
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,340
clinical trials we can't know if it is

560
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,770
healthy or not and especially in the

561
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,050
context of the DI wires we are mixing

562
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:30,330
our powders in our kitchens and we think

563
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:32,530
that we know what we do but who knows so

564
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:34,330
when I was asking about that you know

565
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,550
what is your perception of the risks

566
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,860
that you are potentially undergoing with

567
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:41,500
your diet people are saying both things

568
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,169
such as oh you know hiking the body is

569
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,520
high-risk high-reward

570
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:49,480
some people even having some kind of

571
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,920
like offensive reactions such as oh you

572
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,660
know I know that there are some risks

573
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,910
but as long as I'm the only one affected

574
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,970
I can deal with this risk because it is

575
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,539
my body after

576
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,879
and nobody can sort of talk about you

577
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:04,129
know what should I do with this body and

578
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:08,689
it's also interesting being great and

579
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:10,330
ambitious but I was curious if what what

580
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,710
these people do when they get sick and

581
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,750
it turned out that there is no exit plan

582
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,659
most of the people when I asked were

583
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:20,419
saying oh you know I don't know I feel

584
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:23,120
fine but if I feel sick I think I'll go

585
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:24,529
to see doctor or someone right which

586
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,120
kinda doesn't make any sense because

587
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:27,409
it's totally contradictory to what these

588
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,739
people are preaching right

589
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:34,009
the idea of opt-out idea of doing things

590
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,860
in dependent on the state depending just

591
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:39,139
on a community of people get it online

592
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,908
kind of failed in this context which is

593
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:43,699
not a critic of this community it is

594
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:47,960
just an observation from from this

595
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:49,549
research right so one of the findings or

596
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,250
to summarize these findings from this

597
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:54,110
case study there are both interesting

598
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,120
opportunities of this personalized

599
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,399
nutrition of like complete foods as an

600
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,768
example of personalized nutrition but

601
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:03,500
there were also some limitations or

602
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:05,120
flaws so it was interesting how these

603
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,980
people actually are opening the black

604
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,360
box of what food is because we don't

605
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,720
really know what food is these days

606
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,870
right and they felt empowered they felt

607
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,600
they know more but there were also huge

608
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:20,360
risks and people are kind of oblivious

609
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,490
towards that so there was personal

610
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,408
environment but there was also lack of

611
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:28,700
personal responsibility of the

612
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:32,149
consequences of these opting-out actions

613
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:35,269
and another thing was that kind of for

614
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:37,518
me at least scary and comparison or gap

615
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:39,860
between gastronomy insistence how

616
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,419
suddenly silently it became accepted

617
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,080
that oh you know it can be powder

618
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:46,399
whatever food traditions yes sure

619
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,889
gastronomy sure whatever

620
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,649
so it was example for me of some kind of

621
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:53,299
solutions solution that was doing

622
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:55,729
exactly what techno solution ism is

623
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:57,549
solving food problems how by making the

624
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,830
food disappear from your plate right

625
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:02,658
solving it by escaping it something

626
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:06,559
similar to going to Mars and things like

627
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:09,740
that ok so there was the first study the

628
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,629
second case study will be super short

629
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,510
it is an expiratory study that we just

630
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,250
started a few months ago it is more

631
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,710
design oriented less ethnography

632
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,860
oriented as the first one it's called

633
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:33,169
extreme biopolitical Bistro the Bistro

634
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:36,289
is like box to be strong is this

635
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:40,340
experimental nomadic food tech club that

636
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:40,700
we have n travel waste from one place to

637
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,100
another

638
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,870
usually we present it at festivals and

639
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,949
various cultural events because the goal

640
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:51,080
is to provoke public engagement and

641
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,610
participation in discussions about food

642
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,539
technology issues so the lab basically

643
00:28:52,610 --> 00:29:00,199
is composed of many different parts many

644
00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:02,690
different stations or smaller labs such

645
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,640
as a lab where we speculate about

646
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:08,090
possible food tech futures through third

647
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,929
cards or we build electronical candies

648
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:13,990
that are conductive and reacted to your

649
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:16,669
body when you are licking them

650
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:20,570
experiment with fermentation and all

651
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:21,950
kinds of microbial hex and we also have

652
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,350
a nutritional mclubbe which is something

653
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,440
that I'm going to talk about now which

654
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:30,830
entails personalizing our diets based on

655
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,120
our DNA so I sort of hinted that already

656
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:36,889
with the DNA Soylent recipe that we did

657
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,658
that was with my collaborator Danny saw

658
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,600
that already is working with me on this

659
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:45,440
project so what we did to make this lab

660
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,600
happen is we ordered the testing kits

661
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,190
from company 23andme which is a

662
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,879
commercial company so we paid for that

663
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:56,240
we got our DNA decoded and then we used

664
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,880
two three third party services from ETS

665
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,270
and snip area to interpret these tests

666
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,340
into diet recommendations so we didn't

667
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:07,490
do the usual thing that people do like

668
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:09,649
ordering the ready-to-use thing or drink

669
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,179
ready to use solution but you like test

670
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:13,629
your genes and you get your diet

671
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:18,070
immediately but we did this whole job of

672
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:20,899
trying to figure it out by ourselves so

673
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:23,280
Prometheus is the system where you can

674
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:27,000
upload your raw DNA data and you

675
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:30,260
can go through all kinds of snips

676
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,700
so-called single nucleotide

677
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:35,610
polymorphisms which are the distinctions

678
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:38,460
in our DNA that makes us different from

679
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,719
each other and that are also linked to

680
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,460
you know what you should eat and what

681
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,770
you should not eat in the context of the

682
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,140
nutrigenomics diets so we did that and

683
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:49,100
we checked for our you know elevated

684
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:53,870
risks for certain diseases such as

685
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:58,020
obesity or diabetes - or our ability

686
00:30:53,870 --> 00:31:01,620
expected ability to taste certain

687
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,600
certain flavors and through the system

688
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,820
compared also a snip area which is

689
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,139
basically Wikipedia for snips there you

690
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,790
can just read about every single

691
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,180
polymorphism which is it at longer

692
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,830
number and and letters there in the

693
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,390
corner

694
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:18,000
based on that we basically created a

695
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,700
menu that was tailored to the DNA code

696
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,350
of both me and Aneesa so the menu is

697
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,500
made of the same ingredients for the

698
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:26,730
both of us but it has different

699
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:30,120
proportion of ingredients based on our

700
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,500
distinct DNA so to give you a few

701
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,050
examples because obviously we aren't

702
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,230
going to read a whole menu here

703
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:39,510
let's say the desert the desert was

704
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,970
blueberries and blueberry cake but

705
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:44,670
because of one of us has a higher risk

706
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,980
of developing diabetes - and become

707
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,210
obvious that person got only blueberries

708
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,990
and okay

709
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,340
right because berries are low in sugar

710
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,800
the other person didn't have these

711
00:31:53,340 --> 00:32:00,810
issues so she could have eaten as much

712
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:03,899
cake as she wanted the drinks where red

713
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:07,500
wine so one of us apparently has

714
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:10,050
elevated risk to be addicted to tobacco

715
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,020
and alcoholic products so that kind of

716
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:16,409
sucks so you know no wine for you what

717
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,930
was interesting though that the genes of

718
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:22,100
this person such as that but although

719
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:24,450
connected to like socio-economic issues

720
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,399
there is a thing that if you have more

721
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:28,320
than twenty twelve years of education

722
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,030
there is much lower risk that you will

723
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,939
actually become alcoholic because you

724
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:35,010
are supposed to be educated so actually

725
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,720
after all we allowed for this person to

726
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,908
have at least half of glass

727
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,340
of wine because she has more than 12

728
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:44,539
years of education the other diner

729
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:48,418
though she has jeans that suggest that

730
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:50,549
she has a lower like sensibility the

731
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:52,350
word social critique so there is this

732
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:53,940
thing that she might not actually give a

733
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:56,250
damn about you know people criticizing

734
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,010
her so she got a full glass obviously

735
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:02,250
and opened up because if somebody judges

736
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:04,950
for drinking she wouldn't care so you

737
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:07,320
know it was sort of provocative but what

738
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:10,230
we did with this was we presented this

739
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,030
menu and the cooked meals at biopure

740
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,760
festival which is very round the first

741
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,408
extreme biopolitical Bistro lab and we

742
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,020
were asking people you know to suggest

743
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:21,390
like tweaks for us to like redesign the

744
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,840
menu for us suggests what we should eat

745
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:27,630
and not eat we created this huge Google

746
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,090
document which was linking all our genes

747
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:32,610
and all our susceptibility is to some

748
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:36,959
diseases and issues and ask people to

749
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:38,189
just play with it tweak it and react so

750
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,080
obviously the goal was to provoke

751
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,659
discussion and some kind of critical

752
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:51,949
hands-on activities around the whole

753
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:51,950
idea of personalized diets and for me

754
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,129
yeah

755
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:59,639
the sort of first motivation to do this

756
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:02,700
project was but I saw this website which

757
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:06,179
is trying to introduce or promote this

758
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,140
like new system of this chain of

759
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:10,010
restaurants called

760
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:12,540
Vita mojo who started partnering with

761
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:16,740
DNA feed service which is doing the DNA

762
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:19,379
analyzes and in simple few steps you can

763
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:21,089
upload your genome there and the system

764
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:24,389
recommends you the best meal for you

765
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:26,668
from the beta mojo menu and for me

766
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:28,740
seeing how simple it is to share your

767
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:31,049
DNA with someone just for the sake of

768
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:34,589
convenience just for the sake of having

769
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:36,690
you know you're fast quick meal that is

770
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:38,089
potentially personalized and amazing for

771
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:42,030
you it was sort of scary

772
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:44,940
so with the menu and with the whole

773
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,040
project we kind of wanted to draw

774
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,099
attention to this whole data security

775
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,719
and privacy aspect of eating according

776
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,599
to the

777
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,609
because if you think about it at the

778
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,589
Bistro what we did this we shared quite

779
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:59,270
sensitive information about us right

780
00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:01,670
we shared about one of us being

781
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,980
potential fat alcoholics the other one

782
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,770
being totally oblivious of social

783
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,800
critique and what people think about her

784
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:11,839
the other aspect was kind of black box

785
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,530
think that I talked about in the context

786
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,930
of soil and in this specific example it

787
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,730
is quite questionable if if personalized

788
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:21,500
nutrition is helping you to unblock box

789
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:24,230
something or the other way around

790
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,960
because what we got was you can't even

791
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:29,119
get sorry you can't drink wine sorry and

792
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,450
that's all and you are supposed to trust

793
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,450
it right because it's science so for me

794
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:37,220
it is sort of question if it is

795
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:39,618
empowering me of empowering some or

796
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,500
empowering somebody else and the last

797
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:45,109
aspect would be it was kind of sad to

798
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,849
eat together the one person who didn't

799
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,230
get cake was obviously very jealous of

800
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:50,240
the other person who called her cake

801
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,329
right so it was weird and uncomfortable

802
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,770
to eat together the menu so that opens

803
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,660
the question about possible future

804
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,550
where are we still going to eat together

805
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,879
in the in the age of personalized

806
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:04,780
nutrition and all these things in this

807
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,839
very like playful exploratory study

808
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:10,910
provoked me to like submit applications

809
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:12,799
submit granting proposal for a DNA diet

810
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:16,098
study which is actually like much larger

811
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,780
study which if it gets funded entails

812
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:22,520
collaboration with genomic scientists

813
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:26,660
and philosophers and designers food

814
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:29,300
designers so that's something like step

815
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:31,759
for a future research that I hope will

816
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,400
happen and I will end with this future

817
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,500
speculation now thank you for the

818
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,760
attention thank you for bearing with me

819
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:45,099
with this technologist and open the

820
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,099
floor for questions obviously thank you

821
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:57,769
so thank you market ah so audience now

822
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:59,819
it's your turn any question ah thank you

823
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:01,890
Hey

824
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:04,430
so when you first started doing your

825
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:07,650
research into the personalized nutrition

826
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:11,118
and powders were you looking for any

827
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:16,289
like particular effect like - you know -

828
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,789
and when you did to the your experiments

829
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:19,589
what was the effect that you actually

830
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:20,099
got relative to what you were looking

831
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:22,200
for

832
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:25,049
so you mean effect on myself personally

833
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,910
yeah I did it really as a research

834
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:30,150
experiment so I didn't have any specific

835
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:32,759
goals the goal was I would say to just

836
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:35,670
explore it by myself if it is doable and

837
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:37,979
if it is more or less hassle obviously I

838
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:42,930
had a lot of I screwed up many times

839
00:37:37,979 --> 00:37:44,609
while designing the my own recipes so it

840
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,460
sort of showed me you know that it's

841
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:50,880
really not so simple and it also the

842
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,430
issues around the trust in the Soylent

843
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,799
community kind of highlighted for me the

844
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,529
whole aspect of should you rather trust

845
00:37:55,799 --> 00:38:01,049
expert food systems or something that we

846
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:03,779
do ourselves but I didn't have any

847
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:05,819
specific motivation in terms of I want

848
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:07,650
to lose weight I want to stop you know

849
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:09,450
eating meat then I don't know how so I

850
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,039
better drink powder or something like

851
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,930
that what about the results like did you

852
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,670
feel healthier did you get sick like did

853
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,618
you you know lose weight like what was

854
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:19,319
the actual outcome yeah it was quite

855
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:23,460
interesting I felt quite good I felt

856
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:25,529
really good so I guess it's very again

857
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,960
like personalized right so for me while

858
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:29,940
writing PhD that meant that I'm sitting

859
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,999
in front of the computer all the time

860
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,640
and snagging on all kinds of stuff so

861
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:38,009
when I started drinking soil and it was

862
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,049
certainly simpler for me but at the same

863
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:42,749
time it was obviously that whole social

864
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:45,029
aspect of not being able to go for a

865
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:48,660
dinner with my friends that sucked right

866
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:50,519
it felt like and I felt like I'm kind of

867
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,170
doing some kind of self dialer ization

868
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,149
you know sitting at my desk and working

869
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,890
and working and working and feeding

870
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:58,289
myself with soil and while my friends

871
00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:00,310
are having nice evening somewhere else

872
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:02,770
did you tell combining the like

873
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:05,020
that I mean like exercise or like micro

874
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:08,140
dosing or something else that expand the

875
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:10,630
you know the scope oh well I do I do

876
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:14,170
exercise all the time so it was just it

877
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:16,390
was more of like including this as part

878
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,700
of the like fitness routine but with

879
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:21,460
micro dosing that's I didn't do my

880
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:25,770
closing at that time also because I was

881
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:39,100
in Singapore so death penalty yeah

882
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:43,120
thanks okay we have hi so you mentioned

883
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:46,000
that there is a lack of some sort of

884
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:48,430
reliable clinical trial data like some

885
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,240
sort of reputable institution that would

886
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:54,700
collect verifiable data and stuff like

887
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,350
DNA feed it sounds really cool from the

888
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:01,240
concept but I am very sceptical towards

889
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:02,890
it and what I want to ask is don't you

890
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,500
think that this should be the focus of

891
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:10,480
the community well perhaps if I can make

892
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:12,190
a parallel with smoking then maybe you

893
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,050
will smoke all your life and you will

894
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,690
never notice that there is some like

895
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:22,600
increased lung cancer risk so I think

896
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:25,420
that just mmm maybe maybe the DNA feed

897
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:30,279
it could be missing a much bigger or

898
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:31,870
more important general trend and just I

899
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,390
wanted to hear your opinion about on

900
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,400
these yeah no I actually agree with that

901
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,830
so the whole DNA diet the whole

902
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,280
nutrigenomics energy genetics it's now

903
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:44,520
in the state of suggestions right what

904
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,720
you get from the test is just

905
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,670
statistical probability that you will

906
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,680
develop some disease and you know some

907
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,810
people do crazy stuff when they get

908
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,730
these things like undergo double

909
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:57,100
mastectomy because you might be a bearer

910
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:58,720
of cancer gene and you might get breast

911
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,460
cancer but that's just a statistical

912
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,439
probability that it's gonna happen in

913
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,570
your population group and you might be a

914
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,790
carrier of that scene and in the food

915
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:11,980
context this is where I see the whole

916
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:13,609
the whole new tree genetics potential

917
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,380
gets exploited by the

918
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:18,288
companies because you can sell that idea

919
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:20,150
quite easily right if you have that if

920
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:21,680
you are carrier of the snip that such as

921
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,049
that you might be you might develop

922
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,890
diabetes too it's a sort of threatening

923
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:30,559
thing so you better buy our product and

924
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:33,589
be safe but that's definitely it's it's

925
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:36,259
not it's not accurate at all so this

926
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:38,450
whole commercial area of personalized

927
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:40,819
nutrition or gene based personalized

928
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,919
nutrition is very much based on over

929
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:44,329
claiming the effects and in the science

930
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,369
community there is a huge discussion

931
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:49,730
critical discussion about that as well

932
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:53,210
saying that it actually does not do

933
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:56,059
justice to what we do here as scientists

934
00:41:53,210 --> 00:42:00,440
because it turns it into this sort of

935
00:41:56,059 --> 00:42:03,200
hype hype circus so yeah I would

936
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,450
definitely say that you know I didn't

937
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,129
mean to say that DNA diets would be

938
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,618
something that we should follow or it is

939
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,720
like ideal right I just thought it adds

940
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:14,480
a lot of complexity to an already

941
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,488
complex issue of nutritional science so

942
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,529
I was surprised that such an idea exist

943
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:25,309
okay thanks okay we have one question

944
00:42:21,529 --> 00:42:28,369
here and then one in the front hi I

945
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:31,160
wanted to ask about the experiments

946
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:35,170
people do like how do they measure the

947
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:38,118
outcomes and especially like long-term

948
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:41,299
effects of the experiments in the

949
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,950
complete food community yeah so what

950
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:45,430
from what I have seen people usually

951
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:48,078
track their like metabolic responses

952
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:49,749
through trackers that are commercially

953
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,480
available like all kinds of variables

954
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:57,288
logging they're also calorie intake and

955
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,180
out make in terms of fitness and then

956
00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:00,470
sharing these sheets these locks

957
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,419
basically with the community and

958
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,328
discussing them so apart from doing this

959
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,809
sort of DIY thing they also often do

960
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:11,119
like blood tests which now you can do on

961
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:13,009
your own as well but it's still more

962
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,099
conventional to go to do it with your

963
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:17,420
doctor so that's the main kind of

964
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:19,519
tracking that I have seen in the

965
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:22,849
community and there is also the tracking

966
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:25,129
of your mood of your sleep and of your

967
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:25,940
sexual performance that's very popular

968
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:36,380
in the

969
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:38,569
well thanks hi I really like the idea of

970
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,549
having my DNA sequence but I don't like

971
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:43,190
the idea to have it in some database

972
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:45,619
associated with my name so did you find

973
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:48,799
some way to keep the privacy with some

974
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:50,900
company the company's claim that they

975
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:52,700
totally value your privacy and they will

976
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,309
never ever share your DNA with someone

977
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:58,098
which totally doesn't happen ever right

978
00:43:55,309 --> 00:44:00,530
we have seen so many times that the

979
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:03,650
23andme company for instance shared the

980
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:06,410
customer data with LA police because of

981
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,720
some crime investigation so that kind of

982
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,569
over rules you know the terms of and

983
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,609
conditions of the of the data security

984
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:16,220
and privacy so that's obviously totally

985
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:18,078
sketchy and totally scary especially if

986
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,118
you have dislike candies that are kind

987
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,520
of dragging you into all about your data

988
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:23,119
here and you will get very easy lunch

989
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,140
tomorrow

990
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:29,900
so so I didn't find any way how not to

991
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,759
do that the whole thing I mean just the

992
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,200
thing of submitting my saliva to some

993
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,200
anonymous laboratory was obviously

994
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,410
suicidal mission but I did that as a

995
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,910
sort of provocation for this project

996
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:42,920
thinking that I would I know you know

997
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:45,319
what what does the world knows about me

998
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,470
probably a lot so I can do that but it

999
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:50,420
was not done with the intention of

1000
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:52,220
becoming better person myself or become

1001
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,440
having a better health but more as

1002
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,930
research project where we wanted to

1003
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,880
provoke some kind of reaction okay but

1004
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:01,640
if I could find some anonymous laughs I

1005
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,180
could totally upload this data to SNP do

1006
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,980
something and get if you have access to

1007
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,990
any lab that can do the gene analysis

1008
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,549
for you and there are many places where

1009
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,649
you can do also all kinds of like bio

1010
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:14,420
hacking places bio hacker bio hacker

1011
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:17,180
spaces or you can do it

1012
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:19,250
so that's possible okay thank you

1013
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:22,879
although I also think that Prometheus

1014
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:27,170
got sold last week to some company

1015
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:33,650
called my heritage so but I saw it just

1016
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:37,250
in the morning and I didn't tickets okay

1017
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:38,299
question here okay here we go I would

1018
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,609
say it's not a questions like

1019
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:43,670
contribution to to your question and the

1020
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:45,890
answer I would imagine that just to open

1021
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:48,260
a theoretical possibility it would be an

1022
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:50,960
application of edge computing like a

1023
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:54,140
device where you insert your DNA

1024
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,410
sequence and it's computed on on this

1025
00:45:54,140 --> 00:46:00,348
device directly and never shared with

1026
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:02,779
external companies for example just just

1027
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:04,549
to open that like a device that has that

1028
00:46:02,779 --> 00:46:06,890
no security in a but maybe it's even

1029
00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:08,809
harder encrypted or things like that

1030
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:11,029
well I'm thinking that this community

1031
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:15,609
here might be sort of ideal place to

1032
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:15,609
discuss about these possibilities right

1033
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,470
okay we have question hearing back yeah

1034
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:24,049
I have one more question so what are the

1035
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:26,808
best nutritional studies that you are

1036
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:31,910
aware of or maybe some that have some

1037
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:34,250
non-trivial results so what is can you

1038
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:37,700
pick some that like okay that's not

1039
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:40,549
something I'd like to share reading list

1040
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,078
or something if you go if you search for

1041
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:44,538
let's say the gene based personalized

1042
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,369
nutrition or look at the sometimes it's

1043
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:47,450
also called precision nutrition if you

1044
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:49,779
would be looking for it in Google

1045
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:52,279
Scholar let's say you get a bunch of

1046
00:46:49,779 --> 00:46:54,170
quite interesting studies and you need

1047
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:56,390
to figure by yourself by looking at it

1048
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:58,369
first and seeing if the study is somehow

1049
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:01,098
critical I mean that's a thing for me

1050
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:03,140
where I usually you know decide if it is

1051
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:03,920
worth reading for me or not if I see

1052
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,549
that they are actually talking

1053
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:10,369
skeptically about this whole idea and

1054
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:12,829
science themselves that's a good sign

1055
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:14,450
for me but there are so many like I can

1056
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:17,000
I can show you what so you don't later

1057
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:20,359
but don't want to mention one or two or

1058
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:24,230
did it just nothing's coming up in your

1059
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:26,240
mind maybe oh I know a lot of is coming

1060
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,400
up I don't know I I don't really want to

1061
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,930
do like so like promote to other people

1062
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,119
but look at publications of course I

1063
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:34,339
order us for instance he is becoming

1064
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,940
like a big name in the personalized

1065
00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:39,799
nutrition area he is also in some

1066
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,920
advisory committee of company called

1067
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:44,420
nutrigenomics so that's interesting

1068
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,819
right so he's part of this commercial

1069
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,330
company and he is also looking at it

1070
00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:49,670
from the other

1071
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:51,049
perspectives so that might be even a

1072
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:53,420
promise of some kind of future

1073
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:56,450
development of this area of personalized

1074
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:59,270
or precision nutrition we will see but

1075
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:02,120
check his publications there is a huge

1076
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:04,790
book pile in Ferguson called nutria

1077
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:07,310
genetics and nutrigenomics I think in

1078
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:10,279
everyday everyday food practices but

1079
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:14,720
it's a huge book kind of lot of basic

1080
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:18,830
information as well okay I need to have

1081
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:24,620
a last question do still eat some

1082
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:27,580
Soylent or mana or so the thing also is

1083
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:30,890
that the whole DIY community kind of is

1084
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,540
you know silencing down because because

1085
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:34,879
of the growing popularization and

1086
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:37,040
commercialization of the whole field so

1087
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,900
it's these days so easy to buy some

1088
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,279
ready to use product which is totally

1089
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,080
not interesting for me because I was not

1090
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,420
doing it for the personal effect on my

1091
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:48,710
health but more for the DIY self

1092
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:52,310
experimentation aspect okay thank you so

1093
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:54,920
it mario ended with heck the state call

1094
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:57,890
i think this is more like hell heck your

1095
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,810
body or heck your diet or a cure fruit

1096
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,270
so thank you market up thank you for

1097
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:08,520
sharing with us

1098
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:08,520
[Applause]
