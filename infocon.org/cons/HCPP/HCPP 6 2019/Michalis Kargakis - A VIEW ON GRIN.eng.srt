2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:19,149
[Music]

3
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:29,390
hello they're just work yeah can you

4
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:32,149
hear me love it

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,420
hey guys so let me welcome you to the

6
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:38,180
first talk of today on this stage and

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,410
our first week beaker is mikelis and I'm

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,239
gonna happen it I can introduce him

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,949
because we were friends we did we were

10
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:44,900
on crypto camp but I only police

11
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:47,300
together and we call this is a really

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,760
cool guy he loves privacy his software

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,129
engineer and cipher Bank like many of

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,430
you I guess so today he will tell you

15
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:57,409
something about green and you know yeah

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,049
green privacy sounds cool but I'm not

17
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:02,809
really into mean blue Wimble stuff

18
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:05,420
protocols so I hope you will get it

19
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:06,979
wrong okay so let me hand over to calais

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:12,409
and a father

21
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:15,140
yeah thank you Mario thanks everyone for

22
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:17,330
joining the stork I'm really glad I'm

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,090
doing this specific talk in this room

24
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,460
because two years ago in hackers

25
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,820
Congress 2017 I first learned about

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,979
green in this very room there was a talk

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,070
about privacy oriented cryptocurrencies

28
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:32,960
and the Green was briefly mentioned and

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,880
there were two points that stood out for

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,039
me there also on what the founder is

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,360
anonymous and the second on which side

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,860
Satan rust so me as techie and also

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,580
someone who believes in that privacy is

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,140
a human right I was immediately hooked

35
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,880
so I started researching about green and

36
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,040
I ever since for the past two years have

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,780
been following green I haven't done any

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,060
development because I have not having

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,790
time to learn Russ properly it's can

40
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,560
hunger language to get it but I have

41
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,540
been contributing in other ways I've

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,970
been writing dogs have been helping

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,920
people set up their nose or their

44
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:10,699
wallets in the forums or in the chat

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,099
rooms I've been doing stuff like you

46
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,829
know also talking about green with

47
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,829
friends and onboarding them and also

48
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:23,239
I've also donated to green greens

49
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:24,530
solely founded by donations so this talk

50
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,810
really it's just a walkthrough of the

51
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,220
project I want everyone of you to when

52
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,250
you walk out of this room to have an

53
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,790
idea about green and actually first a

54
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,130
show of hands

55
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:38,359
hope you have heard green before raise

56
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,829
your hands okay that room cool

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,750
so yeah this is a walkthrough of the

58
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,460
project it's a pretty technical I mean

59
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,060
it's it's technical its results um

60
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:49,400
socio-economical part but I think the

61
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,440
technical stuff are pretty easy to get

62
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,430
to it so I hope it's not gonna be

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,950
difficult and yeah it's a bit of

64
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,600
opinionated here and there particularly

65
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:04,730
there's socio-economical stuff in the

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,859
end is it's just my viewers yeah another

67
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,540
question that I have for you is who has

68
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:13,220
a technical background please raise your

69
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:16,190
hands so we have a room as well cool so

70
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,540
my background is I finished my

71
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,070
bachelor's degree in computer science

72
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,260
back in 2014

73
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,750
and ever since I've done some work on

74
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:29,420
Bitcoin on BTC suit and young familiar

75
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,830
with BTC suit no.11 okay cool yeah the

76
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,130
goal particular I've did some work there

77
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,600
back in 2014 as part of an internship

78
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:39,590
then I did some part some stuff on

79
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,150
kubernetes unrelated to crypto if this

80
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,370
year I've been working in guard time

81
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,530
it's we're doing blockchain related

82
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,690
stuff with healthcare I can talk about

83
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,209
this in private but here I'm here to

84
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,010
talk about green so in parallel um

85
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,080
Dingles a master's in digital currency

86
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,540
at the University of Nicosia Cyprus and

87
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:01,820
I've been following green for the last

88
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:04,519
two years and the TLDR about green or

89
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,930
what I think the till they are is that

90
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,840
you know it's a cryptocurrency focus on

91
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,760
privacy scalability and fairness and the

92
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,520
rest of this talk is really breaking

93
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,890
those terms down we all trying to

94
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,959
explore really those what I think are

95
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:23,210
the core tenets of the green and its

96
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:26,000
community so how does green do how does

97
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,520
it affair with privacy really when we

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,830
talk about privacy for blockchains there

99
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,140
are really two different dimensions or

100
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:36,020
is on chain privacy and there's Austrian

101
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,840
privacy first about Unchained privacy

102
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,390
there are really two big features that

103
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,130
we have fear actually there are three

104
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,300
about this the first to use

105
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,820
computational transactions of bull

106
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:51,500
proofs which is what green uses to hide

107
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,430
the transactions on chain I'm going to

108
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,919
briefly

109
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,870
describe how confidential transaction

110
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,380
works there is a little bit of math

111
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:03,139
there so sorry about that and yeah there

112
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,210
are no address is also in green there

113
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,210
way where that transactions are billed

114
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,948
is interactive and we can also discuss

115
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:16,698
about how this works there is a slide

116
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:18,860
about it so no amounts we use a green

117
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,300
uses or confidential transactions and

118
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,100
young familiar with confidential

119
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:27,130
transactions couple people cool so they

120
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,139
are based about my elliptic curve math

121
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:33,440
and we are going to see how they work

122
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:36,260
just the bit preview and there's also

123
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,719
bulletproof bloopers are used for high

124
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,090
court for proving that the amount that

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,310
is hidden in the chain is the within a

126
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:47,030
specific range and the range we are

127
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:49,039
interested is only positive values we

128
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,380
don't want people to be able to create

129
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,880
negative amounts in the chain and hide

130
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,370
them because then they cannot inflate

131
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:01,310
the chain and they can create a money

132
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:03,320
out of thinner so the web conditional

133
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,270
transactions work is you know on the

134
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,120
left you have a standard Bitcoin

135
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,840
transaction where in all the all the

136
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,070
inputs and the outputs are abuse there

137
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,770
you can see them in the chain and you

138
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,180
can verify that the transaction is valid

139
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,919
one of the things that you want to

140
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,080
define for transactions that it balances

141
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:25,039
out so there are no new money created so

142
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,300
you have inputs equal to the outputs so

143
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,120
the way it's done in confidential

144
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,070
transactions is we use there is a

145
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,780
elliptic curve math that are used under

146
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,510
the hood so really the old math

147
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,580
operations here the addition and the

148
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,500
multiplication are elliptic curve

149
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,729
operations and not integer operations

150
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,849
are not the regular operations that you

151
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:46,099
are familiar with so really what the way

152
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:49,430
it works is you have your inputs and

153
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:51,710
your outputs and you use this H which is

154
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,330
a basically a generator point of in

155
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,099
elliptic curves it's a point that can

156
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,380
create all of other points in the

157
00:06:55,099 --> 00:07:00,560
elliptic curve and that's the way you

158
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,780
hide the amount I am familiar with the

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,990
problem that is in this specific

160
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:10,128
equation you're from

161
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:12,199
you know no they're actually yeah this

162
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:14,419
clock I mean it's probably most of the

163
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,059
crypto but the specific problem here is

164
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,729
that this can be built forced so as an

165
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:22,150
observer in the blockchain you can see

166
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:24,860
this this transaction on the right part

167
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,969
you don't know what are the amounts that

168
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,069
are hidden but you know H H is a public

169
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:33,139
parameter so you can try it and use all

170
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:34,400
of the values so that you are know you

171
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,080
know often you can brute force the

172
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,589
transaction so the way really that

173
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,258
computation transactions work is yeah so

174
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:43,939
the V outputs are finite so the way they

175
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,889
can be brute forced so the way that the

176
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:48,800
real computational selection work is we

177
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:52,580
the one more parameter one more actually

178
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,889
point in the curve and this this R is

179
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,680
basically it's called a blinding factor

180
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:00,949
and G is another public parameter I

181
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,289
generator and point another curve so

182
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:05,180
these are basically the what is used to

183
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:08,930
blind the amounts and that they cannot

184
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,789
be brute force really and this R is also

185
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,849
in the case of green it's also useful

186
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:16,759
for proving the ownership of the output

187
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:21,740
if you know R you can move you can use

188
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:23,300
the output no addresses so in green

189
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,249
there it's kind of weird for people

190
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,930
coming from Bitcoin and other

191
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:29,050
cryptocurrencies that you know there are

192
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,370
no addresses in green and blue in bloom

193
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,250
and the way it works is that there has

194
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,289
to be some interaction between the

195
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,389
sender and the receiver before the

196
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:41,419
transaction is and in the chain that

197
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:43,159
interaction can it has happened online

198
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,899
but you know both parties they don't

199
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,990
need to be online at the same time there

200
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:49,610
are different ways where the both

201
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,380
parties can create the transaction and

202
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,810
the basically is a two three rounds

203
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:57,380
going on first one is the initialization

204
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,319
step where the sender sends to receive a

205
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,490
it can also work on the other way around

206
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:03,889
then there's this assigning the

207
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:07,250
recipient signs the transaction it

208
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:09,380
creates some signatures basically for

209
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,709
other kernels I'm going to mention later

210
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:16,790
and then the the party the third round

211
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:19,160
whoever has amount the output it adds

212
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,050
the last signatures and sends our

213
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:27,410
the output in the chain in the nodes to

214
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:30,469
broadcast across the network of chained

215
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,480
privacy how it works is there is

216
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,510
transaction or aggregation by default so

217
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,550
cowan join so you don't need to do

218
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,860
anything you need me to use any service

219
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:43,010
to conjoin its Heights done by default

220
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,170
by the network there is a dandelion plus

221
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,680
plus which is an open proposal for

222
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,630
Bitcoin and there is a there's some

223
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,250
discussion for using as one of the

224
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,410
overlay Network see the right to P your

225
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,660
tour for both for the peer-to-peer

226
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:00,050
protocol and for building transactions

227
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:02,030
in the wallets so how does action

228
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,010
aggregation works is you have two

229
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:06,829
transactions here with well the inputs

230
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,390
ooh daisies but I didn't here but only

231
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,770
on the left you have your inputs on the

232
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,620
right you have your outputs and also the

233
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:15,140
kernels the kernel asara what are things

234
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,540
that hold signatures for the

235
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:21,830
transactions but you know this is it's

236
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,060
really one of the one of the parameters

237
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,700
that was earlier in the Patterson

238
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,800
commitment is what is signed and it's

239
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,460
kept in the kernel so you have your

240
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,229
input you have your outputs and if you

241
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,750
know this blue output in one transaction

242
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,970
and the other it's used as an input in

243
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,040
the second transaction so first to Qatar

244
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,520
Gate the transaction and it's still

245
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,510
valid so from a network from a

246
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,730
four-metre perspective of when you see

247
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,170
this transaction with two aggregator

248
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,030
cycles you just see one transaction you

249
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,699
can validate that it's one but it's

250
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,589
really two transactions and also there's

251
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:59,420
pruning going on so we can remove these

252
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:02,090
outputs yeah

253
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,430
then the lion plus plus further was

254
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,120
actually a proposal by fonti and others

255
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:10,430
back in 2017 or the first iteration of

256
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,850
dandelion then there was a second

257
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:17,439
iteration on last year called an alarm

258
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,460
plus plus and really it's a way of

259
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,940
propagating program propagating

260
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,650
transactions in the network without a

261
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,930
avoid and trying to avoid the

262
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,459
anonymization attacks where you have

263
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,810
multiple nodes in the network and

264
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,950
releasing on transactions and they can

265
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,810
easily find the source of

266
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,540
the transaction was transmitted and then

267
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:39,060
the Lionel helps with hiding the origin

268
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,260
of the transaction and Yan green it's

269
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,079
also an opportunity to aggregate

270
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:46,110
transactions when transactions are

271
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,550
probably propagated as part of there are

272
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,160
two phases really in dandelion I'm going

273
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:53,910
to go through them I think now yeah okay

274
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,800
so the way that transaction propagation

275
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,569
works in Bitcoin and it used to work

276
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,969
also in green is you have me diffusion

277
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,040
so a node when it accepts it or when it

278
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,560
gets a transaction it just sends it to

279
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,870
all of our all of its peers so you get a

280
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,949
transaction as a node and you send it to

281
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,230
all of the peers and all of the other

282
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:13,400
peers send it to their own peers so

283
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:17,160
that's how because it now works and

284
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,319
we've done the lie on we have the

285
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,199
concept of an epoch and the epoch is

286
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,970
real aim at the moment it's just ten

287
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,720
minutes about it's configurable and it's

288
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:31,050
basically every epoch and no decides to

289
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:35,220
either be a stem or a fluff node when

290
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:37,170
you are a stem node you basically send

291
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,970
you choose an outbound period circle

292
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:42,360
point under the period outbound because

293
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:44,460
you have chosen a peer to connect to and

294
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,430
use you send transactions just in that

295
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,410
peer for that epoch whereas if you are a

296
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,719
fluff no you are a normal know who

297
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:54,870
propagates the status for the network to

298
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,270
all of your peers and when you will make

299
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,850
a choice whether you are a fluff or a

300
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,110
node or a stem notes line ninety percent

301
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,120
chance that you are going to stay in the

302
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,050
transaction then do tend to pay ten

303
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,060
percent chance that you're going to

304
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,870
fluff this is also configurable at the

305
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,599
moment so it works let's illustrate it

306
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,520
is a node gets transaction it's a stem

307
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,370
node so it's just gonna send to one of

308
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,730
its outbound peers this is also stem

309
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,770
node same thing stem node and eventually

310
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,930
we get it will of node who just diffuses

311
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,240
a transaction so it's a bit harder for

312
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:30,959
to figure out the origin of the

313
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,880
transaction in this case and yeah it's

314
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,399
obvious it has good a name from the

315
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:41,059
flower dandelion is horrible

316
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:45,769
there is also discussions on using

317
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:48,290
either i2p or tour for both the

318
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:51,559
peer-to-peer provide propagation of

319
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,849
transactions and also for building the

320
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,579
transactions because the transaction

321
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:58,489
building is a different step as we saw

322
00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:00,949
earlier and yeah there are a couple of

323
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:02,959
there's open open RFC for tour online

324
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:07,219
transacting and there is also a working

325
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:10,368
progress pull request for I to P I'm not

326
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,919
sure what's how with what protocol you

327
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:18,379
are gonna end up there are some

328
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:21,169
discussions in the community so how how

329
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:23,029
how green first in privacy it's it's not

330
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:25,669
a hard person to zero knowledge like the

331
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,789
cache for example is it's more rocking

332
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:31,069
to more narrow transactional cam bility

333
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:33,079
is still an issue you can still love

334
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:35,868
figure out when you see a transaction in

335
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:39,108
a network that desiring its input and

336
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:42,319
these are its output and this is a work

337
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:47,809
in progress to fix this still not sure

338
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:50,118
how but yeah there are one thing that I

339
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:52,219
really like about green is that it and

340
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:54,889
it's also something that is founder and

341
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,419
body doing night's events philosophy to

342
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:59,299
put the project's philosophy is that it

343
00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:01,819
it's I it's a minimalistic project and

344
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:03,589
it tries to keep all of the math bare

345
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:06,319
minimum so there are easy to maintain

346
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:09,289
and understand so there's no trusses at

347
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:11,389
abnormal math and really it's similar to

348
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:14,329
associate a real tomorrow to monitor its

349
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:19,699
it's based on the new network size like

350
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:21,608
any other ecosystem really so how how

351
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:24,429
does it fair with scalability

352
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:27,499
there is a transaction pruning and

353
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:29,659
because of transaction pruning there you

354
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:33,289
have a fast initial block download and

355
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:36,109
you also have a lighter chain so you

356
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:39,019
remember earlier how I thought I showed

357
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:40,359
you how a transactions are aggregated we

358
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:44,449
can do the same thing with blocks

359
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:46,399
so blocks can be aggregated and all of

360
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:48,060
the spent outputs can be removed from

361
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:54,210
the chain so you really

362
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:55,530
left with your unspent outputs and of

363
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,760
course the Colonel's secureness are

364
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,400
still the elephant in the room

365
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,040
Alex we are going to see so the boutique

366
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:07,829
is in perspective Bitcoin today has

367
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:10,740
around north of 200 gigs blockchain size

368
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:13,260
- the headers and they unspent outputs

369
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:18,080
and it transparent output size is only

370
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:21,120
three point four gigabytes so in green

371
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,580
there unspent outputs are just a few but

372
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,560
the word that we have a still Enosh with

373
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,150
kernels you need to keep around kernels

374
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,750
to verify that all the transactions that

375
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:33,240
happened in the network were valid the

376
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,950
issue with that is I think it's because

377
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,080
of 'snore-son logic signatures because

378
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:40,740
using snort signatures and snot

379
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:43,590
signatures cannot be in aggregated non

380
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,880
interactively so really only when you

381
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,990
are interacting with someone and you

382
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,680
build in transaction only then you can

383
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:52,520
aggregate those signatures I think there

384
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,390
is some discussion on BLS signatures

385
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,510
bilious signatures would solve this

386
00:16:54,390 --> 00:17:01,710
issue if Greene is able to use Baylor

387
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:03,210
signatures ever we don't know yet so you

388
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,250
are left with your block headers your

389
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:08,760
unspent transactional put on your

390
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:11,700
kernels for an so for an initial block

391
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:16,050
download so it's relatively fast faster

392
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:17,580
than Bitcoin so yeah it's it's really

393
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,800
not another of much is better than

394
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,569
Bitcoin it's a bit better than be going

395
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,629
we still need a second layer of course

396
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:25,980
to scale as we know today with dog

397
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,440
changes you cannot really scale - with

398
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,020
Oliver transactions it's just it's

399
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,080
mostly for security and yeah pruning

400
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:37,830
helps but we still have to go deal with

401
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,780
the kernels at the moment and fairness I

402
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,330
wanted to touch on fairness you know

403
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,620
it's a relief valve term but I think in

404
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,929
the context of green there are a couple

405
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,169
of things that I wanted to touch upon

406
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:51,150
and there is a concept of fair lunch the

407
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,040
emission rate proof-of-work and

408
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:58,260
governance those are the four things I

409
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:00,000
wanted to discuss fair lunch so there is

410
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,780
this concept for

411
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,380
for lunch so the project was announced

412
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:10,850
back in 2016 really so it's three years

413
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,170
old project already it's open source

414
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:17,159
100% community driven it's so solid

415
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:18,930
founded by donate donations and it was

416
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,490
launched earlier this year at the start

417
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,080
of this year there was no ICO there

418
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,180
wasn't there's no founders who reward

419
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,600
there's no pin minor drug no nothing

420
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:31,230
there are some people who are saying

421
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,330
that you know there were some VC founded

422
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,550
startups that they were able to put

423
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,740
millions into mining green this is at

424
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,230
the launch of green so they are saying

425
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,090
that the launch was a little fair but in

426
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,740
my books you can this is as far as you

427
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,810
can go today we live in a world of

428
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,170
capitalism so whoever has the money can

429
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,429
do whatever they like really but this is

430
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:54,510
as fair as you can get today with

431
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:56,790
launching a cryptocurrency the emission

432
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,740
rate is another thing that there is a

433
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,570
misconception about it some people don't

434
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,570
really understand at first and I also

435
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,250
when I first came up across one green

436
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,340
per second forever

437
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,020
I was also bit confused but really if

438
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,470
you spend some time thinking about it

439
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:16,620
it's it's not as balanced as it sounds

440
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,630
it's actually really very minimal and I

441
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:22,469
really like the design of one green per

442
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:24,510
second the there is no advantage to

443
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:28,920
early adopters as it is with other

444
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:33,090
cryptocurrencies who have a max capacity

445
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:37,340
max max apply fixed supplies and really

446
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:42,449
the curve then the inflation goes down

447
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:45,419
linearly so really in 10 10 20 years you

448
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:48,090
have a inflation that is a king to Gold

449
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,170
inflation slowed gold it's much closer

450
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:55,080
to call them with corn for example

451
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:57,180
becomes even harder proof-of-work there

452
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:02,040
is a cocoa cycle used for proof-of-work

453
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:05,960
I added this in the furnace category

454
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:10,379
because I think it's worth discussing

455
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,910
there was this you know ASIC aversion in

456
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,920
the cryptocurrency community in general

457
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,100
if

458
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,000
look around and this was also initially

459
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:24,139
true for a green but you know eventually

460
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,400
Asics are unavoidable and in green we'll

461
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:30,080
figure this out

462
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:32,330
pretty quickly and the way that the

463
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,060
proof-of-work algorithm was designed is

464
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,040
um there are two proof-of-work algorithm

465
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,820
still used from the Coco cycle family

466
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,830
one is basic friendly which is it

467
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,800
started with ten percent of the rewards

468
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:48,230
going to that algorithm people who are

469
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,510
mining in that algorithm and ninety

470
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:53,000
percent ASIC resistant the ASIC

471
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,760
resistant algorithm is phased out will

472
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,320
be phased out in two years and there's

473
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,740
one going to be the ASIC friendly

474
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:03,439
algorithm used as a proof of work the

475
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,030
the reason for that is that you know

476
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,440
that the developers of green will

477
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,920
believe that you know Asics are

478
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:13,340
unavoidable and they try to promote open

479
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,630
hardware design and getting an ASIC that

480
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:20,419
is open open open design openly designed

481
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:22,940
but it's really hard early to get a good

482
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:27,170
open ASIC development but it's at least

483
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,760
it's encouraged on the governance side

484
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,890
there is no foundation there is a

485
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,550
technocratic so-called technocratic

486
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:37,580
council that it was bootstrapped

487
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:41,360
initially part of it were mostly core

488
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:43,250
developers and the reason for the

489
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,189
existence of the council was to manage

490
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:51,830
the donation found were found so I end

491
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:53,420
up being utilized and the council they

492
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,970
know it's still a centralization point

493
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,200
in the project and the people who are

494
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,990
running called the council are aware of

495
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:04,040
it so there is a move towards sub-teams

496
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:05,930
so each component in green will get its

497
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,639
own virtual thumbs up and you have you

498
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,020
have a node sub team you have a wallet

499
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,760
sub then you have found raising

500
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,260
something community sudden are lots of

501
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:17,150
different sub teams that are popping up

502
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,950
and then there is also an RFC process

503
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:22,160
that it has been put in place during the

504
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,780
past month you know there is there are a

505
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,660
bunch of things

506
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,399
changes that improvements in the

507
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,370
protocol and obviously you have to have

508
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,810
a process to get those to get consensus

509
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:37,850
on those changes and there are also the

510
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,350
public by quickly development and

511
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,530
governance meetings they are open to

512
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:45,260
anybody to join I asked Sevilla I'm not

513
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:48,580
a developer but I was I was attending

514
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:51,950
those meetings unfortunately the latest

515
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,080
lately not so much because of work and

516
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,880
stuff but I used to go attend those

517
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,620
meetings they are pretty fun to watch

518
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:02,300
the thought process of team how they

519
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,189
work so yeah I think that's pretty much

520
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,240
it there are a couple of things that you

521
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,630
can do if you are interested in the

522
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,120
project lots of research going on with

523
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,570
lots of new instinct technologies and

524
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,040
every other week who have there are

525
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:19,490
academic papers research is going out

526
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:22,220
and for example had the hallow paper

527
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:25,160
come out a couple of weeks which is a

528
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:28,210
big improvement really for blockchains

529
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,470
and you know there are open positions

530
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,790
positano positions i mean if you have an

531
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,920
interest and you find something

532
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:37,250
interesting here you can just jump in

533
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,380
the project and help out there as I said

534
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,620
earlier the project is finally founded

535
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,390
solely by donations and yeah don't ask

536
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,669
for permission it's open source

537
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,310
um I hope you are familiar with open

538
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,890
source and hard works so yeah I think

539
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:54,280
that's pretty much it

540
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,280
sharing questions

541
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:12,520
you have a microphone thank you for your

542
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,309
presentation my question is how do you

543
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,710
guarantee privacy when you are when you

544
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:20,379
have to force to open a direct

545
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:23,470
connection to the one you are making

546
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,840
intersection - yeah that's a good point

547
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,280
I didn't really mention this the what

548
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,870
this is one of the ways you can build

549
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,330
transactions but it's not the only way

550
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,129
you are talking about the HTTP because I

551
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,678
know the wallet supports sending

552
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,840
transactions building transactions the

553
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,330
HTTP and this is actually a good point

554
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,370
it's a privacy concern because you have

555
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,928
to expose your IP but it's not the only

556
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:48,639
way you can build your transaction you

557
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:51,910
can also just send an email and there's

558
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:56,280
also discussion for doing this

559
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:59,380
transaction building via tour and i2p

560
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,420
so yeah it's a work in progress but the

561
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,850
HTTP is not the only way and actually

562
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,800
there's some people in the core

563
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:14,350
development team they are pretty good to

564
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:17,020
get rid of that choice really so okay so

565
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:20,169
regarding a privacy like you talked

566
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,120
about aggregation of transactions as far

567
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,270
as I understand it happens in regular

568
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,489
nodes or only minor nodes and in case

569
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:31,540
that all no it's really just normal

570
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:34,420
nodes yeah so what happens if like a lot

571
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,790
of nodes are owned by analysis companies

572
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:39,100
or they just broadcast the transaction

573
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,500
instead of aggregating and then well the

574
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,030
transaction is public I know the amounts

575
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,540
are invisible but you can then still

576
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:48,730
like see the link between outputs

577
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,200
absolutely yeah so yeah I mean with any

578
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,380
kind of network you have a mine or a

579
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,300
majority of bonus nodes obviously if you

580
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,700
have if the majority of nodes are

581
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:01,450
dishonest there will be two down on you

582
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,970
my's the network or network and the same

583
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,760
stands for for exam 51% attacks right so

584
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,720
if the majority are dishonest they can

585
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,720
just kill the coin

586
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,760
you don't know that that that has

587
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:21,940
happened yeah yeah that's true that's a

588
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:25,150
that's a good point but eventually we

589
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:27,010
get to know because if this will have

590
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,600
repercussions I mean if your privacy is

591
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:30,610
breached eventually we'll get to know

592
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,199
about it so I'm not real concerned that

593
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,939
you will not get to know about this and

594
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,340
yeah it's it's an issue but this is an

595
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,520
issue with any kind of network I mean of

596
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:42,070
obviously with with one-hundredths

597
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,460
zero knowledge like easy cash you were

598
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:47,980
probably not able to do this kind of

599
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,090
attack but you know with in that case

600
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,400
you have other issues like for example

601
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,750
you have more complex code and you it's

602
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,970
much easier to have bugs right and you

603
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,950
you have bugs also I think there was

604
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,960
recently I was a bug where you would be

605
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,070
able to expose the IP of this and there

606
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,890
so you know there are some trade-offs

607
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:04,840
but yeah good point

608
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:08,470
there is another well-known trade-off

609
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,870
between the privacy and safety meaning

610
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,210
that if you have a complete private

611
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,729
system it's very hard to prove that

612
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:18,700
there is no additional emission due to

613
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:22,240
some bug a mistake and it's more

614
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:25,000
theoretical problem than problem itself

615
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,340
but basically maybe you have some plans

616
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,590
on doing proposing some formal

617
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,350
verification systems that can prove that

618
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:38,919
there is actually no emission due to a

619
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:40,928
bug happening so at the moment I think

620
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:44,290
so at the moment there is you when you

621
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:45,550
download the chain if there is no bug

622
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,590
you can still prove that there's no

623
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,760
inflation but if there's a bug yeah you

624
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,470
cannot really prove that there is no

625
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,490
inflation I think this is a concern with

626
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:57,580
all kinds of privacy related currencies

627
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:59,470
I'm not aware of really of how you can

628
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:05,080
avoid inflation if there is a bug that

629
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:09,040
breaks for example yeah so it's really

630
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,100
hard because if if those coins are never

631
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,720
moved or you know usually you don't have

632
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,370
all the coins moves it's it's it's real

633
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,730
hard I'm not aware of any technique to

634
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,729
avoid that

635
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:24,839
so thankful very interesting tool I

636
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:28,339
don't understand very well a link

637
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:31,708
ability you said that it's similar to

638
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:34,259
one arrow but in Marrero you don't know

639
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:38,429
which output is spent and which not and

640
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:43,049
here you know which is spent because you

641
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:45,059
are pruning it so so how it works so

642
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:49,949
pruning when you prune you prune on

643
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:52,289
chain and don't change you only see all

644
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:54,419
of this was extricated and you know that

645
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:57,059
this outputs are spent so you can prune

646
00:28:54,419 --> 00:29:01,440
them after a while but there is shooting

647
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:03,869
abilities zone is off chain so as a node

648
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,599
when you receive a transaction and this

649
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:08,009
lecture is not aggregated you can you

650
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,069
know that these are its input and these

651
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:13,319
are its output I'm not sure how exactly

652
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:15,658
it works how these issues of chain of

653
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:17,940
for more narrow but off chain forward

654
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,629
greens is an issue and I think it's

655
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:25,619
probably in shock from a narrow and if I

656
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:30,748
would be have malicious node which would

657
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:34,948
store all transactions not waiting until

658
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:37,679
it will be invoked chain I would I could

659
00:29:34,949 --> 00:29:39,269
link I could link everything yeah

660
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,399
assuming assuming all of the

661
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:52,259
transactions that your node has you

662
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:54,649
receive them an aggregated yeah another

663
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,649
questions

664
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:03,900
on this point as well you compared it to

665
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:06,570
the security model of Bitcoin where at

666
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:09,870
least 51% have to be honnest

667
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:12,330
but in Bitcoin it has to be 51% of the

668
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:15,689
miners which have a strong economic

669
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:19,080
incentive but did I understand it right

670
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:21,930
that here a regular normal node with no

671
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,960
real financial stake has to be honnest

672
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:27,930
as well like I can easily spin up a

673
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:32,000
million nodes on Amazon yep

674
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:34,260
forces attack yeah sure you can do that

675
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,760
the end you know there are some for

676
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,100
example in that the line helps in that

677
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,750
case you know it tries to hide that

678
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,810
transaction so you may be your 1 million

679
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,700
nodes you spin up 1 million note but

680
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,730
then you have to force everybody else to

681
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,490
connect your nodes and for example in

682
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,840
the line works in the case you stem a

683
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:56,600
transaction to know that you have

684
00:30:51,840 --> 00:31:00,780
connected to and that's just one case

685
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,419
and then you all it's similar to the

686
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:05,639
previous question like all of these 1

687
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:09,150
million nodes have to be able to get all

688
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,800
of the transactions on aggregated so

689
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:14,340
then you can link all of the inputs and

690
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:18,000
the outputs which I could do if I spin

691
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:21,860
up 99% of all nodes by myself yeah

692
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,860
theoretically yeah you could do that

693
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:35,660
no other questions

694
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,020
all right Thank You Aaron Thank You

695
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,390
mijos

696
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:43,579
thank you

697
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:43,579
