00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,270
this politics Soviet Union fall we need

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,360
to do the things we really would like do

57
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,370
technology grow up children we had the

58
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,800
first President Yeltsin yeah you see and

59
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,890
he grew indeed as we seize the cedar but

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,940
officially appointed about twenty years

61
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:26,399
ago that's everything will go the same

62
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,920
but it is not the situations was

63
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,230
changing slowly the freedoms were

64
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,540
removing slowly legislations were

65
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,090
changing slowly and I can unlike in a

66
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,100
story when a frog if we put it in cold

67
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,739
water instead starts boiling it boils

68
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:45,709
the same things happened to freedoms in

69
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:48,959
Russia now now well Russia looks like

70
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,209
European democratic country Western like

71
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,459
country have Constitution we have courts

72
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:58,830
we have everything but inside it's not

73
00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:01,010
like this currently in Russia it's

74
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,720
called Putin's vertical of power

75
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:07,280
everything is under control in this

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,690
vertical everyone have to be loyal

77
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,330
otherwise they lose this position I have

78
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,359
issues everyone have to be loyal up to

79
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:18,810
the nurses and hospitals after up to sit

80
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,400
down to school teachers as especially

81
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:25,460
for example it's really important for

82
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:28,099
elections because school teachers as a

83
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,008
most of members of Election Commission's

84
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,620
in Russia school teachers so but there

85
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:36,169
are also municipal workers so they can

86
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:42,530
be pressurized by the part of this

87
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:45,560
vertical also for this 20 years real

88
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,109
civil society revolt still real civilian

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,180
activities was replaced by fake ones yes

90
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,789
we have a lot of NGOs some of them doing

91
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,130
real charity help helping children but

92
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:57,860
mostly if you usually see from outside

93
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:02,620
you see yes that's a real and job but

94
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:05,690
inside it's like again previous photos

95
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,750
few years ago the traditional media like

96
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:11,449
newspapers or TV channels which are

97
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,750
being broadcasted are now also

98
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:19,130
completely loyal there there is no

99
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:22,930
possibility to deliver opinion which

100
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,930
does not fit to the governmental ones

101
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:28,039
what's the solution to opt out to such

102
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,930
situation but it's very popular ma'am

103
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:34,520
saying something just get an emigrate

104
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,500
get an immigrate there were

105
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,719
presentations during this meeting about

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,240
immigration immigration and Samson way

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,300
it's not always possible or not always

108
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,909
easy as we seen earlier just to lift

109
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,250
country and forget you about ground your

110
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:55,580
roots your neighborhoods you know your

111
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:59,509
relatives maybe we have ability to leave

112
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,758
to the internet but our government the

113
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:04,699
state the Putin's verticals of power and

114
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,699
notice the power of Internet this year I

115
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,620
think the

116
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:13,699
measure officially measured our audience

117
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:17,389
of Russian internet overtook officially

118
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:19,580
measured audience of TV channels so they

119
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:22,550
really had to do something with the

120
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,090
internet and also like boiling the Frog

121
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:29,060
and especially from technical points of

122
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:32,299
view internet have really really hard

123
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,389
surveillance European democracy

124
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,400
surveillance is prohibited it is said in

125
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:38,330
our Constitution but there are some

126
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,388
exceptions

127
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:47,060
and with this exceptions in timeframe of

128
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:48,949
more than 15 years now Oh our law

129
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,759
enforcement agencies get right for bulk

130
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:56,210
very tapping so every sing without any

131
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,949
control from third parties now there is

132
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,169
record it and need to be store it for

133
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,360
health of year well the fact it does not

134
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:05,109
work there is no such equipment but

135
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,419
government have such rights also

136
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:11,900
applicator II user identification here

137
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:14,240
will I can connect to Wi-Fi there I open

138
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,669
by face in Russia you have to provide

139
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,669
your passport or be identified by your

140
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:22,099
local cellular phone numbers which can

141
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:24,859
be provided to you only if you show your

142
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:29,180
passport also so the complete

143
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:32,000
understanding of who's using Internet is

144
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,110
required by government they are not

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,629
using it yet

146
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,439
but they may use it a lot of data

147
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:43,460
retention also the fact of censorship

148
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:48,169
also censorship is prohibited by Russian

149
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:52,099
Constitution it is said directly but we

150
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:55,099
have to fight illegal or harmful

151
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:58,029
information the fact that censorship

152
00:07:55,099 --> 00:08:00,409
started from protecting children's from

153
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:02,539
its exact translation protecting

154
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:05,029
children from harmful information like

155
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:08,029
how to commit suicide or how to cook

156
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:11,629
drugs but then a lot of other

157
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:15,610
information were added to this list

158
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:18,589
including financial financial ones

159
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:23,029
including something like to like to harm

160
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:24,560
nature procedures are unclean how to get

161
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:29,569
out this list out of block is not

162
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,879
obvious and furthermore it was developed

163
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,190
not from technical side if we develop

164
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,409
from organizational side then they

165
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,110
started blocking information about

166
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:42,229
something illegal so if you write

167
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:48,230
something about those guys committed

168
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:52,040
suicide okay you article may be it may

169
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,170
be blocked also and more important

170
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,760
they started blocking information which

171
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:03,170
is not officially approved and it came

172
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:07,339
to Bitcoin bitcoins are not officially

173
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:10,939
legalized or exist in Russian financial

174
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:13,730
space there are because some of

175
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,610
information which might be blocked on

176
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,980
the internet relates to financial

177
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:24,610
cheating's of our national organizations

178
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:27,500
a lot of local prosecutors started

179
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,350
requesting blocking websites related to

180
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,260
bitcoins related to crypto currency

181
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:37,690
exchanges related to cryptocurrencies at

182
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,689
all including just informational things

183
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,699
actually Roskam Swoboda was advocating

184
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:50,599
use issues it still was still advocating

185
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:54,560
usage of cryptocurrencies and among one

186
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:59,000
of our wins mmm we removed change at

187
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,449
legal practice and officially removed a

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,480
lot of Bitcoin related sites from block

189
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:08,120
lists and Russia but governments are

190
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,680
still it's a positive example Roskam

191
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,019
Swoboda won but we have fresh example of

192
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,349
how government interprets usage of

193
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:21,260
bitcoins Russian opposition leader mr.

194
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:24,529
Novotny collected the nation's using

195
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,769
bitcoins but again they had to put it

196
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:30,620
back into legal space so some people

197
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:32,690
will exchange it Bitcoin to real cash

198
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:38,630
and then submitted as official donation

199
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:41,870
to foundations now it was really icing

200
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:45,050
hugest operation of simulated searches

201
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:47,180
since Stalin's repressions so everyone

202
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,849
was related to this money into these

203
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:55,310
funds was declared as manual oh they're

204
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:58,310
my money launderers so the account was

205
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,199
arrested and their homes including homes

206
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,260
of their relatives were searched there

207
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:04,819
was about 200 simulation searches at 5

208
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:09,899
o'clock in the morning

209
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:11,670
so government was a message from the

210
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,459
saying government does not let you opt

211
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,740
out easily if you are using some

212
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,199
instruments which are not completely

213
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,189
controlled by government they will

214
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:24,680
resist it maybe in modern European

215
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:27,449
countries they would not do like this

216
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,609
but you see Russia developed more than

217
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:32,569
twenty years to get this is to get the

218
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,569
current situation

219
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:44,069
well if traditional media traditional

220
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,050
broadcasting TV traditional newspapers

221
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:49,199
are not available for delivering

222
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,870
information by a position on just by

223
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:56,359
people who are not supporting officials

224
00:11:51,870 --> 00:12:00,480
directly they're using Internet media

225
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,579
this is a YouTube channel again of main

226
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,689
opposition politician mr. Novotny and

227
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:09,029
it's a statistic says more people

228
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:13,769
watches Italy live broadcasts as the

229
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:15,720
first channel of Russian TV you may

230
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:19,279
think it's it could be easier but not

231
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,649
Russian government tries to pressurize

232
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:26,930
huge corporations to bog this

233
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:29,509
information to make it unavailable to

234
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:32,609
somehow inhibit these activities

235
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:36,389
including attempts to inhibit activities

236
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:39,389
of such companies in Russian legal space

237
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:44,600
for example a few years ago there was a

238
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:47,579
regulation as there was a law that any

239
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:53,130
official license that media should have

240
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:55,920
no more than 20% of foreign shares so if

241
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:59,309
you want to run a newspaper you had to

242
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,670
be Russian citizen at least for 80% of

243
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:05,850
Russian organizations so attempting to

244
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:10,529
regulate which huge media platforms are

245
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:14,730
also going this way what what you see if

246
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:17,819
you want to opt out maybe you would not

247
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,540
like to use YouTube because from one

248
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:20,849
hand your

249
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,310
you're trying to run away from from your

250
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,710
huge from your government from from a

251
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,839
huge force but you had to use some

252
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,850
somebody else who is regulated

253
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:35,850
differently and no one knows how they

254
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:38,550
will act in future very interesting

255
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:42,300
things also appears with Internet and

256
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,410
rye and Russian regulator in and Russian

257
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,439
law enforcement

258
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,900
you see internet gives a lot of

259
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,300
beautiful opportunities for you you can

260
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,270
run your application you can run a new

261
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,449
technology service you can bring and

262
00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:00,120
share a lot of information but also in

263
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,610
Russia law enforcement agencies instead

264
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,680
on searching terrorists in the mountains

265
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:09,300
of gas of Afghanistan and somewhere else

266
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:12,000
they are going to social networks mostly

267
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,790
we contacts and then trying to find

268
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,330
memes which looks like racists or

269
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:21,240
extremists or well you see MEMS could be

270
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,670
stupid somehow and could have additional

271
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,940
meanings but ok you just find a picture

272
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:30,030
a scree contacts about real data of this

273
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,370
user and you will successfully found the

274
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:37,350
terrorist even is a 14 years old

275
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:41,610
somebody especially said that such

276
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:43,640
repressions appears in faraway regions

277
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,870
of Russia so most cool somewhere here

278
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,449
but the most depressions on the map

279
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,790
which creates both roskam Swoboda and

280
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:55,050
Internet Protection Society each of

281
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:57,810
these regions have its own FSB the

282
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,359
seeder of KGB or or anti-extremist

283
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:03,239
police they want to find some results

284
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:08,370
they getting random people if these

285
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:11,190
people lives in their regions they opens

286
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:14,130
criminal case and get the check box and

287
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,320
the young people goes for real jail just

288
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,920
for posting memes or reposting some

289
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,920
other texts

290
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:29,810
somebody acts in public space and if and

291
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:33,300
always continue saying something against

292
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:36,119
officials the internet may may be used

293
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,300
for constant repressions and as an

294
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,040
example I which I would like to give

295
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,339
there was protests related to elections

296
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,250
this summer in Moscow and the people who

297
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,640
was writing and on Twitter or posting

298
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:53,640
videos about this protests award declare

299
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,540
declared organizers of massive riots and

300
00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:02,390
spent a lot of time just for posting it

301
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,390
to eat they spending a month in jail

302
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,890
this legislation was specially changed

303
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,589
because it's not criminal code while a

304
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,060
violation of civil code violation and in

305
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,880
Russia and I think maybe in Czech

306
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,040
Republic previously the hardest civil

307
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,660
code while a violation punishment was

308
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:26,160
like 15 days in detention for driving

309
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:29,250
drunk without consequences but what this

310
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,260
was changed if you tweet about not

311
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,930
officially approved meeting you can go

312
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:37,709
for the attention for 30 days so

313
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:40,589
internet it's not a place way when you

314
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:44,819
can go out of a real life the officials

315
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:49,370
and state power starts using it it's

316
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,370
another possibility to pressurize you on

317
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:59,010
that short about Russia but it brings us

318
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:03,870
a set of other different questions first

319
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:07,829
of all people at the beginning of this

320
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:10,589
century opted out from participation and

321
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:13,530
politics for participation in society

322
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:16,889
and that allows Putin's vertical to grew

323
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:22,349
up and took everything in Russian life

324
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:25,650
to control everything good can you

325
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:28,530
really opt out without consequences can

326
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:31,050
you opt out from civil life from

327
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:34,620
political life and do this alone and be

328
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,870
successful what will be future

329
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,580
consequences

330
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,679
of such opting out you see we are

331
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,949
looking in Russian history for 20 years

332
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,960
and I think even 15 years ago no one can

333
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,420
could even imagine what what bulb what

334
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,850
will be happening now I think even two

335
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,530
years ago no one could imagine what

336
00:17:49,850 --> 00:18:00,909
would be happening now with internet

337
00:17:51,530 --> 00:18:03,950
repressions internet RS also we are here

338
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:06,230
somehow technological conferences in

339
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,570
Russia there are some movements when

340
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,059
engineers especially internet engineers

341
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:13,550
or engineers who develop surveillance

342
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:16,309
systems or engineers who develop

343
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,389
censorship system saying no no we are

344
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:20,780
out of politics

345
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,420
we are just engineers we are just doing

346
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:27,590
our job but what is the responsibility

347
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:29,630
for that how your technological results

348
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:33,889
your scientific results will be used in

349
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:36,890
future especially in modern world which

350
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:42,200
is really connected so this is my

351
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:44,390
questions to you I think no one have a

352
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,510
good answer for these questions we need

353
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,570
to discuss it I understand well how to

354
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:53,660
live how to opt out or maybe for some

355
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:56,678
cases we should get back in and opt in

356
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:59,800
for such activities we really don't like

357
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:59,800
thank you

358
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,880
Taurus equations thank you very much

359
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:13,350
thank you a lot for in I hope the

360
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,770
presentations will be published

361
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:20,310
yeah there are bonus slides telling

362
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:23,370
about my organization's so if you would

363
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:25,379
like you may look about them further

364
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,000
yeah okay thank you a lot

365
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,410
thank you all through a presentation and

366
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,280
I think we have a lot of people asking

367
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,360
question thank you for the nice

368
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,420
presentation so this is the current

369
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,030
situation and is the situation getting

370
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:42,780
better or getting worse I mean with

371
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:45,780
freedom in Russia is it's getting worse

372
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:50,340
and actually it's getting worse on the

373
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:53,389
exponents things so maybe heard about so

374
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:57,120
called sovereign internet regulation all

375
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:59,610
this censorship and surveillance

376
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,929
regulation related to the Internet

377
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:07,740
they were developing for I think about

378
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:11,280
10 years now and for example a

379
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,310
government invents content blocking in

380
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,690
light form and think that it will work

381
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:19,710
then they add for example political

382
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:23,460
sites like granny Roo like at that

383
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:26,310
moment Kasparov who a position website

384
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,710
run by former World Chess Championship

385
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,990
and then it appears that the fact such

386
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,530
blockings does not work so this

387
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,780
information be easily can be accessed

388
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:39,629
not instantly but easily the improving

389
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,660
regulation related content blocking it's

390
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:45,420
still available then they adding ISPs

391
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,670
responsibilities and it's still

392
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,370
available and I think more and more and

393
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:53,580
more previously content blocking

394
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:56,459
responsibility was only on our SPS then

395
00:20:53,580 --> 00:21:01,409
they added to search engines so the

396
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:03,240
antics and Google had to remove illegal

397
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,330
Russian information from the search

398
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,060
results then the government invented

399
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,929
so-called information distribution

400
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,149
intermediaries with the same

401
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:15,900
responsibilities and it's still not work

402
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,950
so now the inventing sovereign Russian

403
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,190
internet we

404
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:22,080
should be started on the 1st of November

405
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,520
they're still not all documents

406
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,360
published related to it but we still

407
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,520
think it would not work for for

408
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:36,929
government for his treating information

409
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:39,330
flow to citizens by government I thank

410
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:42,350
you for the presentation you have

411
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:45,810
mentioned a censorship and actually

412
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:49,469
lawmaking leading towards the illegal

413
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:52,800
atte of the well quite common situations

414
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,930
which we experience everywhere um could

415
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,530
you also elaborate on propaganda how it

416
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:02,000
evolves

417
00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:08,120
since 90s well not exactly my question

418
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,120
but I live in country so I think that's

419
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:19,770
medias was really free until maybe 2003

420
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:23,670
2002 2003 there was existed all country

421
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:28,800
broadcasted channels and there was a lot

422
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:30,750
of free newspapers then propaganda

423
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,720
started changing slowly first of all

424
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:37,560
not just governmental media but also

425
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,570
private media was involved and I've

426
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,760
mentioned Putin's vertical of power it

427
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:43,770
does not include it just a state in

428
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:50,580
place it's also include friendly

429
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:53,820
oligarchs so there are some state run

430
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,100
media state-owned medias but other all

431
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,950
Russian medias are owned by putin's

432
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:04,949
friends were companies which owned by

433
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:09,650
putin's friends and to be fair i stopped

434
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:14,190
watching official news at about 2015

435
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:16,800
previously yes you can just watch news

436
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,750
to see trends of government but after

437
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,780
that it was complete it became complete

438
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:24,180
propaganda working not just outside it's

439
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,850
complete propaganda working towards

440
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,429
russian citizens well we are joking

441
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:31,250
that's

442
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:37,970
it looks like we live in Ukraine because

443
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:41,090
any any news any news program on main

444
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:44,260
channels will include you or will

445
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:47,149
include Ukrainian questions on how

446
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,460
housings are going bad in Ukraine well

447
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:53,870
we have a lot of troubles and problems

448
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:58,059
and issues inside Russia this was a

449
00:23:53,870 --> 00:24:01,779
border that's a formal or normal media

450
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:05,240
is there also an evolution in let's say

451
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:08,770
Internet related media or I mean

452
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,899
something like up internet phones for

453
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:15,879
influencing the forms or something which

454
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:17,928
is involving since 90s it's much better

455
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:22,520
situations much better with internet

456
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:25,059
media because you need permission

457
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,760
it's like permissionless innovation

458
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:32,000
permissionless media stream and nowadays

459
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,309
a promised Oviatt union times there was

460
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,679
a special skills for our parents s like

461
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:38,809
reading in between lines so they were

462
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:41,210
reading official newspaper and the

463
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:42,889
standing health situation works now if

464
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,600
you read the official media or close to

465
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,929
official medias you're also reading

466
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,539
between lines it's really important for

467
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:52,640
example to listen presentations of

468
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:54,408
species related to internet internet

469
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,260
technologies Internet companies

470
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,039
delivered by Minister of

471
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,470
telecommunications or presidential

472
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:03,080
administration members because in that

473
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:06,770
case you will listen to it and they will

474
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,168
do definitely opposite and well I think

475
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:13,460
you mean Russia so-called Russian troll

476
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:17,840
farms I think inside russia russians

477
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:21,159
already studied how to resist it so

478
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:25,908
because they have very specific style of

479
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:31,159
and unlike true media unlike true

480
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:33,590
reporters they could be detected so the

481
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:37,580
skills of reading between lines somehow

482
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:40,010
restore it back in russia i have a

483
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,490
question then that's more here than me

484
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,000
you okay so

485
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,470
so my question Alexandra is the

486
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,840
situation and political situation in

487
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:52,169
Russia is quite desperate and the thing

488
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,899
is that majority of people probably or

489
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:56,490
not majority a lot of people they

490
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:57,149
support poaching and they support this

491
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,260
government

492
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:04,649
thanks to propaganda and things to like

493
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:08,250
his own or oligarchy own media's so my

494
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:12,479
question is do you believe that in the

495
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:14,850
near future it can be improved because

496
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,490
for example our our mutual friend admit

497
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:19,490
tree he told me he cannot believe in any

498
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:23,279
change in Russia that why he laughed so

499
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:26,520
it's a vase of support it's actually

500
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,370
really by self support of Putin so if

501
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,010
you trying the somebody well who who can

502
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:37,529
go when die for Putin I don't think you

503
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:41,460
find a lot of people because during the

504
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:44,700
summer protests there were made some

505
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,220
arrests of random people on the streets

506
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,220
they have kind of jokes as a little boy

507
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,380
on a paper cup to a police squad and

508
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:57,960
killed eight people and the rozzers was

509
00:26:52,380 --> 00:27:00,570
so harmed in their feelings so a lot of

510
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:05,779
people was arrested randomly and a

511
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:07,908
stream of people a huge line standing

512
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:11,669
closed what many presidential

513
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:13,679
administrations does just to get their

514
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:18,750
slogan printed and stay for three

515
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:21,840
minutes at the entrance so I never seen

516
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:25,740
that Putin supporters yes there are few

517
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,408
some can Argan self organize themselves

518
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,799
and present their opinions yes we know

519
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:32,520
that

520
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:36,179
for some public actions the people from

521
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,760
schools hospitals municipal workers are

522
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,710
being brought even given some slogan but

523
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:46,440
then we find the slogan on the trash

524
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:48,510
dams so don't think that's 90 percent of

525
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,120
Russians it's not hardly support Putin

526
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,980
now they will a bit affected by

527
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,439
propaganda but they definitely would not

528
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,840
go and

529
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,149
I visited Moscow like maybe five years

530
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,090
ago and I was surprised that really a

531
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:03,580
lot of universe like University educated

532
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:07,990
people they supported Russian as a

533
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:10,509
supportive Putin so videos up so well

534
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:13,539
University educated people work at the

535
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:16,840
universities they actually should at

536
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:19,690
least keep silent or in some cases on

537
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:23,080
high positions as a shoots ace as a

538
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:27,460
support and if you maybe compared to the

539
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,080
huge meeting on the website that the

540
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,779
young people think that's watching

541
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,759
YouTube streamed from a meeting on the

542
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:36,909
streets they are also participating in

543
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:39,909
such meeting so I hope that will collect

544
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:43,029
such bigger so your believer you believe

545
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:46,389
it'll be Italy it being bad friend

546
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:49,659
it will be much better because young

547
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:53,428
people they really feel through things

548
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:57,429
and among young people also might be

549
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:59,919
supporters of was a full spectrum of

550
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:03,909
ideas from left from far left to far

551
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,149
right but most of them see that's what's

552
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:08,980
going on an official media is not wrong

553
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:13,110
so we're questioning somewhere here and

554
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,110
also there and then you and then you

555
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,860
thanks for your presentation and I think

556
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:20,200
I'll build on that question a bit and we

557
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,519
are going your last three questions were

558
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,970
really great in terms of being very

559
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:27,159
critical critical thinking and in terms

560
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,629
of the role and the responsibilities of

561
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:30,220
scientists and engineers and

562
00:29:28,629 --> 00:29:32,139
technologists that are currently the

563
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,450
ones I would say that have the power to

564
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:36,899
build the system that is being

565
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:39,730
introduced by the government right now

566
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:42,129
how did you come to question your role

567
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,230
in your responsibilities and if you do

568
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:46,719
think that there is a movement how how

569
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:48,190
is it that others that have you know the

570
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,509
other technologists out there or the

571
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,340
others that are a part of this right now

572
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:55,830
do you think they will wake up in

573
00:29:51,340 --> 00:30:00,570
question their role as well and how well

574
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:03,789
when I was a young student I was doing

575
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:06,399
not very good things which now called

576
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:07,309
hacking because you write a program you

577
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,549
run it

578
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:13,779
something happens you prove your

579
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:19,580
technological experience and

580
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:21,590
technological superiority and well the

581
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,889
whole computer system of Department

582
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:28,759
stops and two other groups cannot pass

583
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:30,439
exam for example so at some place when

584
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:33,320
you were young you're just doing some

585
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,499
things to have fun or well to discover

586
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,139
something new when you are growing up a

587
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:43,549
bit you start understanding consequences

588
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:46,100
of your actions just about my experience

589
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:48,110
so when I was just a programmer well I

590
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,689
was doing things not very well not

591
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,629
thinking very much but well my

592
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:56,330
professors were trying to explain me

593
00:30:52,629 --> 00:31:00,678
when I'm started using other people as

594
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:02,418
tools become a little boss I understand

595
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,889
that my responsibility grows more and

596
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:12,440
more and well how did they came to

597
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:15,258
talking about this when working a CTO at

598
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:19,970
ISP and being responsible for some

599
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:23,029
technological solutions I just it's like

600
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:26,779
a nearly every lower in Russia is former

601
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:29,059
police officer and for what what's a

602
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:32,059
mode of police officer first of all

603
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:35,090
everything prohibited and if you see

604
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:38,749
somebody in ranks you lose your free

605
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:40,939
will so being at a technical executive I

606
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:43,220
had to study laws and to explain to my

607
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:47,360
bosses that we can build our network we

608
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:50,029
can connect our I have studied low a lot

609
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,129
and understand how especially in Russia

610
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:54,080
you should understand not just did you

611
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:56,178
not just really read the laws and

612
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,449
understand consequences of your actions

613
00:31:56,179 --> 00:32:01,249
but you also can need to think ok we

614
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,559
will have corruption in this direction

615
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:05,299
and consequences will be this Oh

616
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:10,090
corruption in this direction and

617
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:10,090
consequences will be that so I hope that

618
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:16,369
nowadays everyone will think a bit more

619
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:20,600
about technological responsibility again

620
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:21,260
when internet and computers came I was

621
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,990
teenager

622
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:26,390
when computers came and well they beat

623
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,160
up a bit after teenager when Internet

624
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,470
came and that moment it's just

625
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,020
interesting thing you are just testing

626
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,210
your limits

627
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,580
nowadays I don't think that people

628
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:41,630
massively need to test their limits so

629
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,280
widely and and also well grown-up people

630
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:46,669
and experience that people will explain

631
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:52,850
them that but again we need to work

632
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:55,460
together thank you very much for your

633
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:58,790
presentation very brave presentation in

634
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:01,160
terms of everything I wanted to ask you

635
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,470
we are having this kind of very strange

636
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,630
phenomena in Slovakia especially in

637
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,940
terms of people who came from Soviet

638
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,160
Union which ran away from Soviet Union

639
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:14,559
which during Soviet Union were really

640
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:17,600
like anti-communist who today for some

641
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,870
really unknown understandable reasons

642
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,149
are really strongly supporting like

643
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:29,059
today's policy of poutine the idea of

644
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:33,950
Slavens being like one big nation and

645
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:37,940
whatever and and they kind of when we

646
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:39,860
analyze it we look we think I my family

647
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,410
ran away from Soviet Union we have this

648
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,540
kind of thing in my family as well and

649
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:48,290
we and we saw that people who ran away

650
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:51,500
from KGB not to be prosecuted kind of

651
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:54,559
cross the borders different type of ways

652
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,169
today are strongly supporting Putin and

653
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,270
they kind of eating the propaganda and

654
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:01,220
we have this also along the politicians

655
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,340
who are dissidents in Czechoslovakia who

656
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,860
are strongly supporting and whatever

657
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:10,190
annexation of Crimea and whatever all

658
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:14,149
conflicts fuelled by Russia so the

659
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:16,159
question is if there is a way how we can

660
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:19,100
hack back because probably this is a

661
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,869
result of of some kind of propaganda and

662
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:25,129
fake news and whatever and any kind of

663
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:28,040
discourse which we have from the news

664
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:31,279
coming and showing how Russia is getting

665
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,409
up and the evil evil Western society is

666
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,030
killing it back to the knees the

667
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:38,330
question is if there is a

668
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:42,740
there is a resource or know-how which we

669
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:46,690
can apply to to show it to people

670
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:50,178
without calling without causing a

671
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:52,310
immediate rejection of the information

672
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:55,460
because there is a lot like auntie

673
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:58,880
auntie fake new sites but they cause

674
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:01,010
rejection immediately at the zombied at

675
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:08,480
the zombie to audience I think there is

676
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:10,840
no silver bullet unfortunately so in in

677
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:16,310
case of former Soviet Union's

678
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:19,010
immigrants it's like they remember that

679
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:21,880
good times like the trees was big and

680
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:26,120
ice-cream was tasty and girls was young

681
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,670
so it's also works really well I hope it

682
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:32,270
would not work well well for me because

683
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:34,310
I have when I when I was a teenager I

684
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:38,300
was really believed that first of all I

685
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:41,180
will visit a flowering apple trees on

686
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:46,100
Mars and maybe then senior girl falls

687
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:47,990
only them actually Soviet Union fell and

688
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:52,549
informations a great flow information

689
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:56,000
open for me I have chance to select this

690
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:58,700
and select this but I'm not trying to

691
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,860
classify information as really good or

692
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:04,000
bad there are a lot of really good

693
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:07,150
information in teresting information and

694
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,400
the problem is that the most people

695
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:13,970
think that's unusual things are

696
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,920
dangerous I think in this audience when

697
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:19,310
we see something unusual and unseen

698
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,920
before we find it interesting but it is

699
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:24,860
said that psychologist says a broader

700
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,130
audience find it dangerous and start

701
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:31,220
fighting and doing other things maybe

702
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:33,650
something happens something same happens

703
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:36,649
to immigrants from Soviet Union so they

704
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,840
find something unusual is this new

705
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,360
society especially newly developing

706
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,700
society with new technologies and then

707
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,040
they trying to hold back to something

708
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:49,109
they understand the general secretary of

709
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:52,160
Communist Party like mr. poo

710
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:56,100
and when strong hands and they just

711
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,980
trying to beg I don't know in Russia we

712
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:02,250
hopes as a huge newer generations grew

713
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:04,740
up and came I was at Elections

714
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:07,860
Commission the last elections in this

715
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,680
September and we definitely see the most

716
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:12,690
actively voting people and there was a

717
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,140
great campaign run by opposition and

718
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:19,740
this but the most watching people was

719
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:23,069
born in 30s 40s and 60s and younger

720
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:27,330
people just did not came toward maybe

721
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:32,150
slowly young people with new open minds

722
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:32,150
will replace or older ones

723
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:39,690
well actually we should talk about

724
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:45,320
opting out let's try to get back to this

725
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:48,300
topic if I can I have questions also

726
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:51,870
about the passive support would you

727
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:54,540
agree that the propaganda made them

728
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:57,270
belief that without put in there there

729
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:04,860
will be war so we need one strong leader

730
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:08,670
to keep a peace sorry I missed the

731
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:13,200
question itself if you would agree that

732
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:18,060
the passive support could be motivated

733
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:22,410
by this belief not sure I think the

734
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:24,930
passive support is it works like we

735
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:28,379
would like to be with majority and

736
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:31,919
propaganda creates an idea of the Putin

737
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:34,590
is supported by majority it's funny

738
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,740
things that's all public poll saying

739
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:42,570
thats Putin have support over eighty

740
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:44,189
percent but actually when some of the

741
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,440
sports start showing Inc okay that's

742
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:50,100
it's not eighty percent but a bit slower

743
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:54,420
they they stop making such polls

744
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:57,150
so this well passive support is actually

745
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,810
like for any community we would like to

746
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,810
be with majority

747
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,920
I'm not an active politician of

748
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,190
politologists to talk about motivations

749
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:18,540
of people around Putin I can talk about

750
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:20,760
Internet and consequences okay not

751
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,380
exactly Internet but I think Oh at least

752
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,900
I understood from something that you

753
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:28,170
said that there's alternative movements

754
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:31,140
that are now starting to to rise to pop

755
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:34,140
up if you couldn't elaborate a bit on

756
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:38,940
this because I don't think we hear about

757
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:42,230
this in the West much well by young

758
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:45,690
people is very popular it's very popular

759
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:49,950
libertarian party so ideas like this are

760
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:54,330
very popular against among students of

761
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:57,629
young courses so again it's really

762
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:59,759
difficult to say the only actively and

763
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:02,100
constantly actively participating

764
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,010
opposition leader is mr. Novotny but

765
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:08,970
he's not alone his bill he's building a

766
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:12,300
structure in regions who well while he's

767
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:14,459
trying to say something about corruption

768
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:19,200
corruption of officials on federal level

769
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:27,170
in some regions are his offices which

770
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:30,960
trying to talk about local issues they

771
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:33,270
see the political party system in Russia

772
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,970
is actually completely spoiled so we

773
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:38,490
have United Russia with majority we have

774
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:40,950
three more parties in Parliament and in

775
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:47,370
Parliament they are mostly voting like

776
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:50,549
others be opposing on safe things and we

777
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:52,319
have 60 more political parties which

778
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:57,000
definitely control from a car one

779
00:40:52,320 --> 00:41:00,960
control point I think gain younger

780
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,680
people this real feeling of what's true

781
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:09,360
and not will take more power and few

782
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,770
years there are local activists who

783
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,810
tries to do something

784
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:15,410
another activities it's not political

785
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,410
activities

786
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:21,149
ecological activists but not white topic

787
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,610
ecological activities but for example

788
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:27,240
people who try to save the forests in

789
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:30,500
the region or fight forests for

790
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:35,899
wildfires in the region there are active

791
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:39,950
very active movement now against

792
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:42,750
building new trash dumps in regions so

793
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:46,890
somebody from Putin oligarchs friends

794
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:51,150
trying to export unsorted trash from

795
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:52,830
Moscow region to further regions just

796
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,050
for storing in without sorting and

797
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:59,940
something like and in those regions up

798
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:01,500
rises activities against that very being

799
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:07,280
suppressed they're being suppressed with

800
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:10,110
typical things like importing bringing

801
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,660
police squads from from neighboring

802
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:15,570
region so if local police squad would

803
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,089
not go against local people the others

804
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:21,300
been bringing it but it's still a prizes

805
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:24,590
people stopped fearing so that's what

806
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:28,890
happened and on this summer protests

807
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:32,550
even under risk of being arrested or

808
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:34,650
harmed people went out to straight it

809
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:38,090
surprises I'm not sure it would be as

810
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:44,480
big as a Soviet Union fall but I hope

811
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:49,680
and the Internet is one of our tools

812
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:53,760
question hello I'd like to ask if the

813
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,770
new new measures from the government to

814
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,660
access the Internet are going to in

815
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:01,050
Russia are going to be similar to what

816
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:04,009
is happening in Turkmenistan the Turkmen

817
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:07,020
net from which is kind of like internal

818
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:10,440
net just for the country and it's very

819
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:12,750
hard to go outside of the truck magnet

820
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,850
this is going to be something like that

821
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:18,210
it's really difficult to be something

822
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:20,910
like this because first of all Russian

823
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:24,360
internet until 2010 was developed

824
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:26,250
completely free until last year the

825
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,630
Russian internet if you measured by

826
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,850
number of companies participate

827
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:33,460
in global Rohtang was the second biggest

828
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:37,330
in the world United States Russia's and

829
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:39,250
Brazil development of Russian internet

830
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:41,350
have stopped viewers stopped few years

831
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:43,270
ago while for example United States

832
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:46,120
still develops and Brazil still develops

833
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:48,550
and Brazil ever took us last year so

834
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:52,089
Russian internet is big and it was

835
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:54,910
developed owned by the elite of

836
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:57,310
invisible hand of market

837
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:59,710
unlike took many Stan at like North

838
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:03,190
Korea like Azerbaijan Belarus was a

839
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:06,490
state monopoly and Russia is still part

840
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:09,550
of Europe consul of Europe it pretends

841
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:13,330
to be European so they can say up we

842
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:17,020
have state monopoly now no Russia need

843
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:19,990
to pretend to be European so the changes

844
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:22,350
will be slowly they want to do this they

845
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:25,390
try to legislate this way on that way

846
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:28,420
previously they try to get control right

847
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:33,029
right - can to get right to control even

848
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:35,610
internet / you know institutions like

849
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,630
International Telecommunications Union

850
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,070
they have not succeeded because

851
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:44,650
International Telecommunications Union

852
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:47,860
is not about internet so few already

853
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:50,890
with this content blocking measures and

854
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:53,350
that retention measures Internet

855
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:56,470
infrastructure in Russia costs times

856
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:58,089
more than Internet the same in Internet

857
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,830
infrastructure for the same number of

858
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:04,240
user for the same capacities and in

859
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:06,700
other countries the instantly it would

860
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:14,740
not be like this but our government is

861
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:16,569
working on this question thank you for

862
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:19,600
the presentation I've not actually a

863
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:22,300
question but think about Russia there

864
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:25,779
are also positive positive things coming

865
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:29,230
to my mind thinking of Snowden example

866
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:33,910
for example the German government for

867
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:36,190
example is not giving him any SR despite

868
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:40,600
EU would like to come to Germany as an

869
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:42,099
example or for my personal case the the

870
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,880
RT network

871
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:50,440
you know it's state-sponsored but it's

872
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:53,109
an international network like CNN or for

873
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,759
example they are you know they're

874
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:58,989
talking about Bitcoin for example on a

875
00:45:54,759 --> 00:46:03,039
daily basis so this is there are not

876
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:06,309
only bad perceptions of Russia and in

877
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:09,849
the West so it's the pictures it's big

878
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:12,910
and your view is the view of the

879
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:14,440
censorship maybe but there's another

880
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,058
picture like security for example

881
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,849
because there's an international

882
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:22,299
conflict going on like not o East East

883
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:25,359
expansion and the picture is quite big

884
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:26,559
just I want to add that well worth is

885
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:31,989
not black or white

886
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:33,869
first of all international security is

887
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:36,519
actually one of the drivers of

888
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:40,569
motivation for any government to do any

889
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:43,569
stupid things well as Snowden said

890
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:45,249
himself he stays in Russia just because

891
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:48,940
his passport got canceled at that

892
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:53,769
location and no one offered his I solemn

893
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:54,940
Russia today before or 2014 well it's

894
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,008
English speaking Channel

895
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:00,339
and I was watching you just to practice

896
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:04,239
my local English and at that moment it

897
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:07,328
was channeled like with documentaries

898
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:09,759
and a little bit of conspiracy a little

899
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:15,640
bit of conspiracy like about freaking or

900
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:18,400
like Americans does not support

901
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,868
diversity very well something like but

902
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,900
after that it becomes full-scale

903
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:25,539
propaganda very well done very well

904
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:29,650
sponsored full spell propaganda by the

905
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:31,900
way saying guys the reports who talks

906
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,539
about constantly about Bitcoin it was

907
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,940
started before that times so it still

908
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:39,579
works but you should understand that

909
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:42,549
what guy you seen a guy from men and

910
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:46,869
black you should be careful with such

911
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:49,930
guys I completely agree with you I also

912
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:51,819
think that in these days RT is like just

913
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:54,868
really strong Russian propaganda like

914
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:54,869
Putin propaganda and

915
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:01,320
Snowden the thing is that Snowden for

916
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:05,730
Russian government is really how to say

917
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:10,230
very valuable think because thanks to

918
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:14,940
snow then they it is basically some kind

919
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:18,780
of political advantage against Americans

920
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:21,210
you know because so so I think from this

921
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:23,010
point of views we can we can see Snowden

922
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:26,820
to be just a political victim you know

923
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:30,810
and and Russians there are ever of his

924
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:33,060
political value so this is the thing so

925
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:35,940
I think I think things are about

926
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:38,820
Snowden's that's what remainings of

927
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,619
Pirate Party unofficially registered

928
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,359
running a conference related to

929
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:45,000
cryptography security and something like

930
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:46,799
we tried to invite Snowden but it but

931
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,050
but it's not possible it doesn't appear

932
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,080
on public but the thing is that that

933
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:54,540
Russian government didn't provide him a

934
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:57,000
saloon just because they care about

935
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:59,670
human right you know you should be aware

936
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,609
though that yeah they provide him a

937
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:05,010
saloon because he can he can be really

938
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:13,259
effective political to you know and this

939
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:14,970
is what happening so yeah and here also

940
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,830
does and Snowden that doesn't doesn't

941
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:21,180
doesn't like Snowden doesn't like

942
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:23,700
Russian government as I know yeah hey so

943
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:26,520
he's like a forced to stay there because

944
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,439
other countries refused him to and mr.

945
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:32,820
Putin does not like to change his

946
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:36,090
opinion so if once they let him in

947
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:38,910
unfortunately they could not change it

948
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:41,220
and back to Bitcoin if I if I'm in

949
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:43,140
Russia and I have Bitcoin what can I do

950
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:47,730
what can i buy with Bitcoin today in

951
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:53,150
Moscow oxide you definitely will not

952
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:57,030
have location like this so or because of

953
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:59,520
Bitcoin as I mentioned Bitcoin related

954
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:02,280
information sites and services are

955
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,980
pressurized by financial services but by

956
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:08,069
by Central Bank on Ministry of Finance's

957
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:10,079
I know even cases when the coffee

958
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:13,288
jobs for starting accepting bitcoins

959
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:16,140
stop doing this so differently there is

960
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:20,630
no such funny infrastructure like this

961
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:24,239
at ATM terminals there may be some

962
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:28,170
machines allowing you to put things in

963
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,759
another thing about what signs of this

964
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:33,059
question because I forgot to say this in

965
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:37,589
presentation this situation with

966
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:40,380
pressurizing and random actions of state

967
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:44,599
actors does not let Russian people to

968
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:46,979
think about future so it's maybe

969
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:50,069
international corporations have plans

970
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:53,399
for us and ahead but small ISPs small

971
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:56,849
companies usually have planning limit

972
00:50:53,400 --> 00:51:01,019
one year ahead or even maybe few months

973
00:50:56,849 --> 00:51:03,359
ahead so there is no such location like

974
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:05,488
this and different things the people who

975
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,410
get a lot of bitcoins over successful

976
00:51:05,489 --> 00:51:09,809
own bitcoins prefers to buy Tesla

977
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:11,578
instead of building Paul such space like

978
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:13,739
Institute of Krypton our key and

979
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:15,719
creating these workshops on sponsoring

980
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:18,449
conferences related to the future

981
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:20,099
actually here on this conference we are

982
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:24,359
talking about future well with some

983
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:27,449
exceptions from past but it's also we

984
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:33,119
should be based on this that's a sad

985
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:34,739
thing Russian people do not feel that

986
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,880
they have great future ahead

987
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:40,650
that's why them the opposition grows up

988
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,440
that people like me is talking about

989
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:45,660
what's going on the yes people start

990
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,979
seeing and okay we are now studying to

991
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:51,808
graduate what belay what what we next

992
00:51:48,979 --> 00:51:54,930
okay thank you a lot and maybe last

993
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:56,940
question if you have any question okay

994
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:59,819

999
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,789
here and I seen what we're talking about

1000
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:20,569
how this place is organized and I try to

1001
00:52:16,789 --> 00:52:23,690
