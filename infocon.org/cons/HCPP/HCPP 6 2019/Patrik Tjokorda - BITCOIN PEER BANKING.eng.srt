3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:33,460
hello thanks for coming and thanks for

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,620
staying here I'm very happy that you are

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,930
here even though I know everyone is

6
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,589
waiting for the party which will be

7
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,660
great but in order to have a great party

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,630
we all need some good topics to talk

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,779
about and I'm really happy that I can

10
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:53,739
introduce mat recorder who has a really

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:01:02,190
interesting talk about leader banking in

12
00:00:53,739 --> 00:01:05,920
Bitcoin so please welcome Patrick hi

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,289
it's starting to be funny right from the

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,330
beginning probably because everybody's

15
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,720
expecting I will explain the technical

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,850
details I'm not a tech person so of the

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:21,130
implementation but I'll try my best

18
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:25,060
if who's the developer here ok I'm just

19
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:27,070
checking who's gonna give me hell but

20
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,460
really I mean I'm not a tech guy

21
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,189
although look I come from FinTech where

22
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,229
I built two FinTech companies like

23
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:38,048
payment card companies and I was

24
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:40,929
normally considered like a quite

25
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:43,060
technically based and but I normally

26
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,770
talk to corporations and bankers so I

27
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,939
always was considered okay he knows

28
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:51,009
Taiki here it's quite the opposite most

29
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:54,130
of people in Bitcoin are so technically

30
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:58,659
rooted that I feel like I'm a baby in

31
00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:01,719
this bear with me I'll who's here on the

32
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:05,380
tomash is presentation before ok so I

33
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:09,209
can I can follow on that one did you get

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:13,210
the replication of alone and in features

35
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:16,240
that's great ok so you're not even and

36
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:23,620
no longer afraid to take a loan using

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:28,090
futures right it's cool okay before we

38
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:32,650
go into the technical details I think

39
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:34,950
it's important to answer actually why we

40
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,350
need to do this and I think this is the

41
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:42,100
we'll go through why how and

42
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,579
and and what how to do it and please I

43
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,290
forgot

44
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,110
let's because it's the last presentation

45
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,640
and Hecker's Congress let's run it like

46
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,380
a workshop if you have a questions

47
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,019
there's there won't be Q&A at the end

48
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,280
just ask right away I want to make sure

49
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,510
that everybody understands what we're

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,170
going through

51
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:02,079
okay so I think the first key thing is

52
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,299
to answer why we actually what too much

53
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,640
explain was the financial construct of

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,820
how you replicate it alone and if it if

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,459
it's possible to be done over Bitcoin so

56
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,380
we know that it can be done right and we

57
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,560
know that it's needed for finance

58
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:23,380
serialization of Bitcoin right but in in

59
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:25,060
in more general level it's important to

60
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,000
know why we actually really need it over

61
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:31,960
Bitcoin and not over II theorem and all

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,750
that stuff so before we answer that I

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,240
I'll try to answer some of the questions

64
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,350
that already were raised like the roles

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:44,790
and if it can be scaled up to miners and

66
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:48,760
hedge funds and institutions at Sarah so

67
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:52,630
imagine this this is like the drawing on

68
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,750
the Paul Rosenberg talk when he said

69
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,650
that you should have like this

70
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,240
transcendental vision right just like

71
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,910
something likes which is like 50 years

72
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,460
ago forward so this is like really like

73
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,460
20 years forward this will not exist

74
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,070
tomorrow we need companies to help us

75
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,790
build it right but just think about just

76
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:14,590
try to imagine that the the use case

77
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,170
that Thomas discarded is the Ellis and

78
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,660
both so Ellis goes is replicating the

79
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,460
loan because she wants to go leveraged

80
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,100
along Bitcoin she wants more Bitcoin

81
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,099
then both is providing that short

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,670
liquidity the the dollar side right so

83
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,060
buh is actually any financial

84
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:36,460
institution hedge fund institution

85
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,440
individual that wants to take his

86
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,719
dollars and is searching for an

87
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:45,520
interesting interest and it's okay to

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,870
hold bitcoins in his cold wallet so

89
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,520
that's that's Bob and there's a lot of

90
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:53,680
use cases for both then Charlie

91
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,229
is actually like Bob but he's not a

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,770
finance guy Charlie is a minor or any

93
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,610
business in Bitcoin that neat that's

94
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,979
accepting Bitcoin or mining Bitcoin and

95
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,680
instead of selling it right away to pay

96
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,980
for electricity in an account in dollars

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:16,360
they can play that short side to Ellis

98
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:21,130
the same way for an interest so they

99
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:25,210
basically hatch from Bitcoin to $2 or

100
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:28,389
any other currency so by this you can

101
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,940
enable any shop or any retailer anybody

102
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:33,250
is accepting bitcoins to accept bitcoins

103
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,310
and hatch the volatility way or the

104
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,860
price movements away and without selling

105
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,400
it and supplying liquidity to the whole

106
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:46,470
ecosystem which is extremely important

107
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:50,650
concept because instead of them buying

108
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:53,290
stable coins through that utility

109
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,780
they're actually creating you stable

110
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:59,050
coin use case they're solving stable con

111
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,380
use case through that utility so you're

112
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,539
actually having the benefit of having a

113
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,460
stable currency without stable coins

114
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:07,120
which is extreme extremely important

115
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,580
concept here

116
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,229
so that's Charlie and then imagine Dave

117
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,659
which again can be in an individual but

118
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:21,010
most probably it's a professional that

119
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:22,720
knows ah where's Patrick I saw him here

120
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:25,120
somewhere that that's a guy that can do

121
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,460
it in scale because he knows that

122
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,020
there's a lot of demand from Alice's to

123
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:34,210
go a long leverage and there's a lot of

124
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,719
dollars on the other side but they never

125
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,409
match

126
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,440
there's always difference so Dave is

127
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,169
basically a finance guy that's balancing

128
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,490
of the difference between demand and

129
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:52,530
supply in any currency because Bob and

130
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:55,780
Charlie can hatch $2 but also two euros

131
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,609
francs and whatever you think about so

132
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,739
there could be a lot of Dave's making

133
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:05,080
money balancing of the liquidity so

134
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,650
once you have that utility that creates

135
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,859
on Bitcoin as the underlying any

136
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:15,849
synthetic asset and you have liquidity

137
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,849
that matches then suddenly the last use

138
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:20,500
case is starting to make sense then

139
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:24,699
that's Emily which is basically a

140
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:28,479
derivative trader or any speculator that

141
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:31,690
can use that ecosystem to trade not only

142
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,270
pairs pair to Bitcoin like Bitcoin

143
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,159
dollar Bitcoin euro etc but if you take

144
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,380
this if you remember as Thomas was

145
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:40,569
putting the pairs together if you take

146
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,009
Bitcoin dollar and Bitcoin euro and they

147
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,750
flip it over and it canceled out a

148
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,580
Bitcoin you're left with dollar euro

149
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,720
which is the most liquid futures market

150
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,409
on the planet so for Emily

151
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,250
transcendental vision twenty years

152
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:57,669
forward for Emily it can suddenly become

153
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:01,270
the cheese has access to financial

154
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:03,280
ecosystem that has Bitcoin as the

155
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,710
underlying but she doesn't have to see

156
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,258
it she doesn't even have to deal with it

157
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:12,638
she's just trading our euro dollar and

158
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:19,389
that's perfectly possible to achieve

159
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:23,620
without stable coins so at the end it's

160
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:25,469
peers banking peers at the outskirts of

161
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:29,680
this system there could be peers

162
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:31,780
studying it but at the edges of it where

163
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,169
you need a lot of liquidity there can be

164
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,360
bridges to institutions which will

165
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,939
source probably a lot of liquidity to it

166
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,039
okay so this is the like for us this is

167
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,470
the mental picture like where this can

168
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,089
actually go this is some what we just

169
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,399
described this is something which is not

170
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:51,850
possible to do or is not existent on

171
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,010
Bitcoin today you can't do it right they

172
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,920
aren't the only area where this is

173
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,339
possible a little bit is ovary theorem

174
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,420
and defy projects but not over Bitcoin

175
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,070
but this is completely different

176
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,729
approach how to do it over a bit corner

177
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:09,550
okay so where this thing could live just

178
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:14,770
a little hint we will get back to this

179
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:16,150
is you have Bitcoin on chain as the key

180
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,000
monetary invent

181
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,310
we have and then you have different

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,450
sediment layers like on Chain Lightning

183
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:27,310
liquid and this our utility layer we

184
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,370
call it a utility layer or accounting

185
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,079
layer it we think of it like a third

186
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,970
layer but it doesn't have to be a third

187
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,470
layer as such it's based it's likely an

188
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,960
abstract set of rules and tools how you

189
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,970
account for the values on the Bitcoin on

190
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,490
the line in any of those settlement

191
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,530
layers so they can be different

192
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,390
implementations of this lightening

193
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,130
different on liquid different unknown

194
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,800
chain will get this and at one point

195
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:57,280
they could converge together and create

196
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,250
one cohesive ecosystem that goes into

197
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,569
different layers so so this pure banking

198
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,110
concept can live in different layers in

199
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,000
a little bit different way okay so it's

200
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,950
not a protocol it's not something we'll

201
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,410
write down and publish and everybody

202
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,530
will just use it we want community to

203
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:19,900
actually get to the protocol by building

204
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:23,740
it so now when you know where we what it

205
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:28,120
can go now it's a it gives us good base

206
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:32,110
to answer why we actually need it okay

207
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,780
so Thomas touched on the first one and

208
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,640
that's usefulness of Bitcoin now

209
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:41,260
everybody is using Bitcoin as a store of

210
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,090
value but may enabling financial

211
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,480
products on top of Bitcoin gives you

212
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:49,720
more utility more usefulness to use

213
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,120
Bitcoin as the underlying to have loans

214
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,200
features and all that kind of stuff so

215
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,060
Bitcoin suddenly becomes more useful and

216
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,890
this is what a lot of critics of Bitcoin

217
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,520
and call for right it comes not useful

218
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:08,740
its etcetera this gives you a lot of

219
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:11,980
utility so that's the first point when

220
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:14,710
it's gonna get more useful it will

221
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,660
attract liquidity and that's another

222
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,490
important thing we need in Bitcoin is we

223
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,260
need more liquidity for this ecosystem

224
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,860
to grow so that the liquidity doesn't go

225
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:26,590
to other alt Cohen's or somewhere else

226
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,720
we think of boosting liquidity like a

227
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:33,750
vacuum cleaner

228
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:37,330
of Fiat yeah because when that's futures

229
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:39,190
concept its we because when you when you

230
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,050
buy support you have to have you know

231
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,150
$1,000 to buy thousands worth of

232
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,459
bitcoins right if you want to buy

233
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,900
thousands worth of bitcoins in futures

234
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,990
you don't have to have that right you

235
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,840
can take $10 and buy it so it's in its

236
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,270
inflating that that balloon and it sucks

237
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,610
the Fiat liquidity so the more we do the

238
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:00,640
first one the more vac the bigger vacuum

239
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:04,210
cleaner we make for Fiat to go into

240
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,770
Bitcoin which is great okay so so look

241
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,090
and when you have more liquidity you

242
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,699
have more robustness and all that stuff

243
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:12,430
so it really helps to build the whole

244
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:16,270
thing so that's the second one the third

245
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:21,699
one once you have more utility and more

246
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:25,620
liquidity then you by default help to

247
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,940
support the security budget of Bitcoin

248
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,070
yosef who's not here there was a

249
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,030
presentation on the heck is Congress on

250
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:35,890
the security budget that basically means

251
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:39,370
if there's enough subsidy or money for

252
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:41,199
miners to secure the network so and the

253
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:45,010
question is once the subsidy is gone or

254
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,020
getting smaller and smaller then do they

255
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,520
have the motivation to do it and one of

256
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,189
the ways to do it is to increase the

257
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,770
utility over Bitcoin because the more

258
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:57,010
utility even though it's played in the

259
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:59,680
upper layers like a third layer and not

260
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,750
all the time settled on chain where the

261
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,260
miners make the fees the more utility

262
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,390
have there the more fees ultimately I'll

263
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,100
get to the Unchained so you helped to

264
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:13,720
secure the network basically to give

265
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:17,650
miners more more money that's a

266
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,180
different version they were okay there

267
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,400
was a last version of the presentation

268
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,099
which will have some changes but it's

269
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,900
okay so these two points should be

270
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,900
connected and that's keeping or

271
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,689
maintaining sovereignty sovereignty

272
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:34,839
which is keeping privacy that your I had

273
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,810
actually that talk about like kyc AML

274
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,330
and that stuff and self custody so

275
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,459
privacy important topic of course and if

276
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:46,450
we're able to do this in

277
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:49,900
peer-to-peer manner be compliant doesn't

278
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:52,570
mean you have to go through kyc and we

279
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:55,329
think we know the way the rude how to

280
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,010
actually be compliant without kyc we

281
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:00,010
think at least in most of the

282
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,260
territories so so doing this in P

283
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:05,319
through P manner can keep us the privacy

284
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:08,470
which is important topic and getting

285
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,400
alone doesn't mean sending your bitcoins

286
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:16,330
to block by orbit go vote Thomas

287
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,280
explains in whatever swaps you want to

288
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:23,230
enter your position you're keeping your

289
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:27,150
bitcoins in your wallet or in essa

290
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:30,190
margin and multi-sig wallet so whatever

291
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:32,590
product would be built using this you're

292
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,810
always in full control of your bitcoins

293
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:37,630
which is important thing so so that

294
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:40,300
that's the set of why's why we actually

295
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:43,300
think this is super important to build

296
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,930
up a Bitcoin and we only see very few

297
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,099
companies going this direction one is

298
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,170
announced on honey badger is something

299
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,210
that works with the escrow so there's a

300
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,819
couple companies but not that much as

301
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:59,740
some a theorem so everything it's super

302
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,880
important is the white clear if you

303
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,680
don't remember anything from this

304
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,470
presentation not the tech details and

305
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,680
stuff this is the important stuff

306
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:11,170
because the why we do stuff why we do

307
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,420
things that's the most important driver

308
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:21,670
for community to get together and build

309
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:24,280
something so my question is you

310
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,959
mentioned earlier that all the defy

311
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,650
applications are being built on the

312
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,870
etherium with a few exceptions why is

313
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,610
that what was this technically

314
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,620
infeasible prior to the SEC what

315
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:39,540
activation as an example or is that

316
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:42,370
purely there no some cultural reason I

317
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,719
see from my point of view that and it's

318
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,930
just my point of view there's two things

319
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,610
one I don't think a lot of people

320
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,280
actually recognize the invention of

321
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,560
Bitcoin what it actually is that it's a

322
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,910
monetary policy invention they think of

323
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,880
it as a technical invention

324
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:00,300
once you recognize that then it doesn't

325
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:05,110
make any sense to build everything right

326
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:07,510
and then if you don't recognize that a

327
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,970
quick shortcut to get something done is

328
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,110
a theorem because it looks just easy to

329
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,270
build something on a smart contract

330
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,600
right because it's easier to build it

331
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,100
not to build it in a secure way like

332
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,250
when we started to think about it we

333
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,780
thought okay let's build it up a bit con

334
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,910
that's difficult it's just more to see

335
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,560
how we do I said it was really really

336
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,420
hard to actually get there so we started

337
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,540
to go through the eutm projects to learn

338
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,180
how maker Tao works how compound works

339
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,640
how they use the interest rate curves

340
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,910
and all that you know stuff so so we

341
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,819
learned that and then Damian Robinson's

342
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:46,630
paper was published in I think February

343
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,580
or March which open us eyes or tomash

344
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,370
his eyes because he's the main engineer

345
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,260
of this so how to actually build it over

346
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,800
Bitcoin so it wasn't a neat just for us

347
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:59,620
that easy

348
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:06,188
thing you like to see how to build it ok

349
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:08,290
so we have the Y now okay what Thomas

350
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:13,270
covered a lot of what and most of you

351
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:15,069
understood the principle of overloan vs.

352
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:20,199
features so I'll touch on that very

353
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:22,619
lightly so basically the core the core

354
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:26,260
building stone to get this done as CFD

355
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:28,239
contract for difference we can we can

356
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,129
call it forward contracts or whatever

357
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,110
but basically it's a CFD it's just like

358
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,850
one asset and another I said any fixed

359
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,860
the the other asset in the first one

360
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:39,070
that's basically it right so you take

361
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,320
Bitcoin and you fix the other Bitcoin in

362
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,460
dollar terms versus the other one and

363
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,110
you account for the difference if the

364
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,230
price goes up price goes down that's

365
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,990
basically very simple what's important

366
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,000
it's it settled in Bitcoin it's not

367
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,040
settled in dollars it's settled in

368
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,810
Bitcoin so the Bitcoin is the the goal

369
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,230
to the underlying which is used to

370
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:01,530
settle it and once you have that are you

371
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:05,080
can create a storm I showed vase and any

372
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:07,780
basically any synthetic any asset that

373
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,740
has a real-world price or get to the

374
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,950
price feeds and

375
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,650
listen is over there are over Bitcoin

376
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,059
and out of that he can create the

377
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,059
financial products like loans and

378
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:23,170
features okay so a quick example just

379
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:27,120
conceptually is so these are the

380
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:30,010
variables that you need for the contract

381
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,979
in different applications if it's on

382
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:36,520
China and liquid or lightning this may

383
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:38,440
change or the the possibilities could

384
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,129
change but generally this is what you

385
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,940
need so assets so Alice needs to make a

386
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:50,320
deal with Bob to hedge dollars or euros

387
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,910
or even stocks so you can anything I

388
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,820
mean any asset that he has a real world

389
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:57,250
price so Emily at the end you remember

390
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,189
the use case of Emily she will not see

391
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:05,140
Bitcoin and she can trade dollar vs

392
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:09,820
Apple stock with Bitcoin underlying

393
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:11,710
completely collateralized so they agree

394
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,040
on the assets and then they pick the

395
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:18,690
sides so Alice goes along Bitcoin and

396
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:22,629
and Bob or Charlie goes short Bitcoin

397
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:26,470
technically they go long dollar for an

398
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:29,500
interest okay so they agree on the

399
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:33,100
nominal value like 1 million worth of

400
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:36,520
futures contract they agree on the

401
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:41,439
interest rate let's say 10% per annum

402
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:43,030
and they agree on the price feed.you

403
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,390
there and now we're getting into a bit

404
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:48,700
of technical stuff where we don't we're

405
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,559
not that trustless is we want to we're

406
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,630
trying to be as it should be trustless

407
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,350
as much as it's possible practically to

408
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,790
be trustless so so let's say in an own

409
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,639
chain implemented which I'll show you

410
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,110
they will use an external price feed

411
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,330
from Bittaker and reference rate from

412
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,909
CMA for example so that's a weak point

413
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,439
right because it's external external

414
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:12,309
feed so you have to find a way how to

415
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:16,750
make it more stable more trust less or

416
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:19,960
trust minimized in a way or in your your

417
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,830
eyes implementation over lightning you

418
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,749
can use DLC contract this

419
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,168
contracts where you put all the

420
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:29,690
different price levels into the contract

421
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,570
and then once the prices reveal the

422
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,879
contract actually picks it up and

423
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:37,039
distributes the values so there's

424
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:38,480
different different ways of how to do it

425
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,749
but basically you need a price and

426
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,659
that's that's one one weak point and

427
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:47,149
then you actually both sides need to

428
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:49,519
agree on where they get the price from

429
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:54,320
so it's not you know the system uses the

430
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:56,149
source but if Alice and Bob agree that

431
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,529
they're going to use Kraken they can use

432
00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:01,729
Kraken it's their choice yeah it can be

433
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:04,970
decentralized to a certain extent or

434
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:07,070
make trust less as to a certain extent

435
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:11,690
so but that's the evolution of the whole

436
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:13,580
concept and then they agree on the

437
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,109
duration if it's fixed if it's really a

438
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,080
lot of futures contract or it's

439
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:21,109
perpetual and they have to then know the

440
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,418
mechanisms how to cooperate basically to

441
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:27,259
be sure that the margin that is locked

442
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:29,809
in multisig or in lightening channel or

443
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:31,970
they can settle they can add to it they

444
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:34,158
can withdraw if the other party is not

445
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:38,600
cooperating etc but these are basically

446
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:41,179
the the key parameters and we can get to

447
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:45,019
more like implementation detail on the

448
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:46,580
on the how part but what do you get from

449
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:48,259
this and that's a different spin of what

450
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,230
Omar said this the stable cone stuff

451
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:54,049
that you creating stable coins without

452
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:57,019
stable coins basically I'll just stop

453
00:21:54,049 --> 00:22:01,580
here because it's it's not quite it's

454
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:03,499
it's not obvious from the start at least

455
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,439
it wasn't to us unless we arrived to

456
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:11,259
that state so these are three different

457
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,259
stable types of stable stable coins

458
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:20,989
models like the fiat Becht like circle

459
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:24,499
coin or the maker doll let's say died in

460
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:27,350
the altcoin back and then the back by

461
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:30,080
Bitcoin I'm living out the algorithmic

462
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:32,929
one because that that that failed

463
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:37,790
completely so I'm living it out

464
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:39,290
so and there's these characteristics are

465
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:43,190
important for any stable con to be

466
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:46,040
stable all right so you have what's the

467
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:49,130
backing what type of assets you can

468
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,950
actually build on it the trust aspect

469
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:54,740
the peck that's important one what's the

470
00:22:51,950 --> 00:23:01,510
underlying I said and utility that's

471
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:04,910
another important one ya know what's the

472
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:08,120
base base based courses so it's

473
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:12,860
basically simulating central banks so if

474
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,989
the price is if the peg is broken then

475
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,969
you either erase or lower

476
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:19,010
either supply or interest rates so

477
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,080
that's how you target the price that's

478
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:25,850
basically what central banks are doing

479
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:27,770
by targeting inflation yeah and yeah I

480
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,230
won't get to why they failed but they

481
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:33,620
actually bumped into regulatory role

482
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:35,180
basically by creating their derivatives

483
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,199
I think right I think that was the angle

484
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:41,720
so here with the feared ones so you hit

485
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,630
the so that most of you know this right

486
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,170
they the the premises you look $1 in a

487
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:51,860
bank and then issue a ERC 20 token in

488
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:55,730
the value of $1 and the premises is that

489
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,649
it's stable it's not or its it just

490
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,050
can't be stable by default because where

491
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:03,280
they lock the money in a bank so imagine

492
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,909
if the whole world would use those

493
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,940
fear-based

494
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:10,940
of fear backed tokens as an enormous of

495
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,740
money locked in banks now what they do

496
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:17,030
with the money in the bank they just

497
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,620
won't let it later have it there with

498
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,180
the negative interest rates all right

499
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,189
then they need to turn over the money

500
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,290
they need to make money on it so even

501
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,700
circular announced that they all the

502
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:29,629
money that they have in the bank they

503
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:32,420
will put in a a-plus securities and once

504
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:36,470
they did that step then the road from

505
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:39,890
AAA to BBB and CCC is like it's just a

506
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:43,400
matter of time right so by default it's

507
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:45,410
a fractional stable coin it's not stable

508
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:50,480
it's not core alized

509
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:56,300
run on the bank easy here so it's not

510
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:58,540
stable yeah just that last point that

511
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:02,870
you made about circle putting all the

512
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:05,120
coins that they've got in custody in did

513
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:08,139
I miss something there or no they they

514
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,120
put the collateral they hood in a bank

515
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:16,820
the collateral of the Fiat collateral

516
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:20,209
not the cook Sophia probably not that

517
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:22,460
stable altcoins the the biggest Yusuke

518
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:27,290
the the biggest example is dying right

519
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:29,000
it make sure it out there's a couple of

520
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,870
issues with this although they did an

521
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,130
enormous work to bring the industry

522
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:37,600
attention and all that so that's it's

523
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:42,350
awesome but the thing is with die is I

524
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:46,310
would pick maybe two or three okay so

525
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:49,310
the underlying is ERC 20 tokens it's not

526
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:53,120
a store of value you have unless you'd

527
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:57,980
if you don't have Bitcoin there its its

528
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:02,120
end of the game for stable coin but you

529
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:05,240
can hedge it using the rivets let's do

530
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,060
spaghetti stuff and if it's not simple

531
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,110
heart

532
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,649
it's just spaghetti stuff

533
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:14,120
it breaks yeah you can witness you need

534
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,010
this and this and this for this to work

535
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,040
so there's too many woods and cuts and

536
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:20,570
it just doesn't work so that's the first

537
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,010
is the problem is the unlined the other

538
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:26,810
problem is the peck so dice dice like it

539
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:29,060
they basically behave like your central

540
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,250
bank right or a fish arbitrary they're

541
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,899
saying oh it's the person it's doing

542
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,700
health because they need to keep the

543
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,180
park but how can you keep the pack

544
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:41,240
manually with arbitrary interest rates

545
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,680
on 24/7 market when the market should

546
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,560
decide what the interest rate is that's

547
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:48,920
just nonsense it has to be algorithmic

548
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:52,490
and they they have a lot of problems

549
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:55,700
with this so if they automated that

550
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,790
that's one way to go but the problem

551
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,720
with die is the mainly is the last one

552
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,409
is the Utah

553
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:06,560
so they print money right and then they

554
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:09,320
search for utility like why the peg is

555
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:12,110
moving that widely is because most of

556
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,950
the users just technically thirst

557
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:17,449
lock them up take the die buy more ether

558
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,490
that means the selling pressure is huge

559
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,980
they're just getting rid of it that's

560
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:27,590
why all the Seelos of dye are not the

561
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:29,540
wallets are but are the wallets of the

562
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:32,030
exchanges where they just saw they saw

563
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,920
the dye so they lose they don't have the

564
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,740
utility all right so they search for

565
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,740
utility whereas here with this with this

566
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:42,260
example it's it's the other way around

567
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:46,820
we don't want to solve the stable con

568
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:49,550
use case by through utility alleys needs

569
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:52,820
alone the building stone of Finance and

570
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:55,370
Bob wants to supply the liquidity so you

571
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:58,399
start with a liquid with utility with

572
00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:03,500
the use case with some meat and as a

573
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,880
by-product you get a stable cook so you

574
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,740
don't have to search for utility you

575
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,940
start with utility and the stable con is

576
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:14,420
just as a natural byproduct to it so

577
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,250
with the Bitcoin approach as we as for

578
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,260
describing here you don't have to solve

579
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:25,270
utility you cannot get the stable con

580
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:25,270
with other utility for the recording I

581
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,270
make sure I understand so with the way

582
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,889
that would actually look that we're not

583
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,940
saying an actual stable coin we're

584
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,610
saying there's some button in your

585
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,710
wallet that you know initiate some kind

586
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,979
of trade that locks the value do I

587
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,030
understand this correctly yeah okay cool

588
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,210
it's just you have bitcoins in your

589
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:48,200
wallet and you say okay I want to fix it

590
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:51,160
in dollars and if the market is working

591
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,420
and there's enough liquidity then you

592
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:57,050
instantly find a counterparty that you

593
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:58,490
match with but you look at in in dollars

594
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:01,820
or then you can switch it to euros

595
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:04,760
that's etcetera but the only real asset

596
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,129
is the Bitcoin under there's no tokens

597
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:11,260
no stable cones you have to buy to have

598
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,260
the exposure or to hatch

599
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:15,859
so that's the utility then underlying is

600
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:19,129
bit going the only store of value that's

601
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:23,239
easy Peck is maintained basically by

602
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:25,218
consensus so it's it's no artificial

603
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:28,820
interest rate it's basically a consensus

604
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:30,710
on a price okay

605
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,289
it's trustless and he can have any

606
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,179
assets on top of it so we think it's

607
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:38,840
quite superior to it though it's

608
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:44,289
difficult to build but it we think it's

609
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:48,009
quite superior so yeah okay can I go

610
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:52,700
forward okay we have okay ten minutes

611
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:54,940
okay how we can build it now you can

612
00:29:52,700 --> 00:30:00,109
give me hell with the texture

613
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:01,339
okay settlement that's the main okay so

614
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:03,859
there's things you shouldn't see cuz

615
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:10,190
this is an old one but now you give me

616
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:13,099
hell but so this is like a trade of

617
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,019
slide so if you implement it on

618
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:17,089
different layers it's basically a trade

619
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:18,830
off between what the layer the

620
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:22,700
settlement layer gives you like the

621
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:24,739
speed and cost versus so that you're

622
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,129
able to keep the margin at the

623
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:31,519
appropriate level or withdraw it as when

624
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:33,080
you need it or you can edit fast as you

625
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:38,869
need it so that the contract stays

626
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:41,570
solvent basically so you can you can

627
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:43,158
implement it on Bitcoin on chain which

628
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,718
we haven't published yet but we want to

629
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:49,279
by end of the year hopefully but we are

630
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:51,379
yeah yeah but by end of the air we

631
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,609
should we should have it published in

632
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:57,199
the updated news white paper on the on

633
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:59,869
chain is of course expensive right so

634
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:05,330
it's for higher value transactions but

635
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:07,009
for the use case the tomash showed going

636
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,580
leverage long for the whole bull market

637
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:14,469
that's exactly it you're building a big

638
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:18,949
position for long term so paying fees

639
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:20,629
big your faces okay so you can do it on

640
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:23,749
unchain you don't need to know

641
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:25,189
signatures so you can build it on on

642
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,960
chain now

643
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:30,160
actually you don't need app for it even

644
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,160
you can you can do it on paper so just

645
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,510
we can just take a paper and do the

646
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:39,080
contract on paper and meet here next

647
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:42,110
week again on Sunday and and settle it's

648
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:45,080
easy the tech just make cities more

649
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:47,240
easier to do it but we can literally

650
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,919
make that contract here on paper and it

651
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,050
would work we would just go an open

652
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,030
multisig account at a multi-sig wallet

653
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,860
on one chain put the margin there and

654
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:59,120
that's it we come back here next Sunday

655
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:01,520
and we settle so that's own channel you

656
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,350
can do it on liquid which is basically a

657
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,990
different version of one of Bitcoin on

658
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,540
chain which is faster so for any use

659
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:13,280
cases like once they will connect ones

660
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:16,180
blog stream will connect or exchanges it

661
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,129
can be used in situations like maybe

662
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,680
institutions like Patrick was asking

663
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,870
like why we need huge volumes

664
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,760
transferred quickly entered into

665
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:29,239
contract quickly they could be on liquid

666
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,970
and then you have lightning which your I

667
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,680
already published some paper on and

668
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,410
that's an interesting one because it's

669
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,660
the most capital effective and

670
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:41,720
cost-effective option you should be

671
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:44,180
online in most of the cases but it gets

672
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,100
us to in an interesting us long term

673
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,870
aspiration when where the whole thing

674
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,179
could actually go that's it's really

675
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:53,209
cool so you have different settlement

676
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:56,630
options how does the contract settles so

677
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:58,730
the unchain the unchain implementation

678
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:02,150
is pretty straightforward so you have

679
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:05,030
the CFD with all these parameters the

680
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:10,010
nominal value and etc so you put that

681
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:12,649
into the app and then the app opens you

682
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:19,840
or you do it manually a multi-sig wallet

683
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:23,030
on chain where you fund the margin and

684
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,949
there's another weak point except the

685
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,470
price feed and that's it needs to be

686
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:31,430
arbitrated right so if either party

687
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,990
stops cooperate for whatever reason you

688
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,510
need to be able to access your funds

689
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:38,000
alright so you need to have an arbiter

690
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,780
what Hodel Hodel is doing for example

691
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,450
they are

692
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,730
they are the arbiter we're thinking of

693
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:46,910
different concept then where you have it

694
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,790
like a Federation of arbiters so it's

695
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:52,820
more decentralized you can be sure they

696
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:55,820
think of like a Federation of Arbit of

697
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:57,500
arbiters like your tracer gas block

698
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,929
stream and all the big guys in crypto

699
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,910
which you trust and you can be sure that

700
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:06,590
when they run the arbitrary arbiter

701
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:08,090
software it runs it does its job and

702
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,279
they know how to how to keep it running

703
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,950
right so this this is what you need and

704
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:19,040
you can be sure if one fails there's you

705
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:20,870
know five or six different ones yes so

706
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,690
you have the Melissa you have let's say

707
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:29,270
this arbitrary arbitrary network and

708
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:34,250
that actually gives you a basic very

709
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:36,679
simple smart contract over Bitcoin also

710
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,780
I would add that the other way how to do

711
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,340
it without arbitrary on chain is using

712
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,610
this gridlock contracts which you can do

713
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:45,440
Bitcoin on China as well might be more

714
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,830
expensive because you need to settle

715
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,590
like every week or every month or but

716
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:53,989
you can get rid of the the arbiter you

717
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:56,000
can use the LCS and you can do it today

718
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:59,750
because there are deals implementations

719
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,190
as well yeah but this it's very it's

720
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,260
easy to understand this because this

721
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,000
it's quite analogical from traditional

722
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,940
finance right you have like a batchest

723
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,160
batchest product like the ratio and this

724
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,620
it's easy when you go to lightly that

725
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,240
that that's starting to get pretty cool

726
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:19,339
because then lightning is can be

727
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,450
continued settlement so he can settle in

728
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,580
seconds there's different

729
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:26,000
implementations of it you I was working

730
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:28,250
on not continuous settlement but

731
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,730
settlement with DLC the discrete local

732
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:34,880
contracts but basically in lightning you

733
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:39,320
can get to stage once you have enough

734
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:42,560
liquidity where whereby Alice and Bob

735
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:45,350
can with the flick of a finger switch or

736
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,529
hatch from dollar to Euro it's like

737
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:49,970
Spotify overbid store and sort of a

738
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:52,920
thing

739
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:55,620
it's the implications of this are huge

740
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,810
because in traditional of finance is

741
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:03,960
bound by transaction cost and speed here

742
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:07,830
it's marginalized there's almost no cost

743
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:12,060
and the speed is lightning so here you

744
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:15,410
can actually get to almost like like

745
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:17,700
loans without a credit default risk

746
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:20,819
because it's continually settled every

747
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,569
second it's really interesting where

748
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,370
this could go

749
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:27,530
of course the road to get there is just

750
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:30,150
it's really long but the the ultimate

751
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:35,910
the the ultimate picture which you can

752
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:37,320
think about is just enormous right but I

753
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,120
would if you're interested in

754
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,830
enlightening implementation there is

755
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,020
going to be linked to your eyes

756
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,900
implementation with lightning combined

757
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,300
with DLC contracts which is not

758
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:52,560
continuous right it's it's not

759
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:54,510
continuous until the other party

760
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,920
disappears and when they do you have to

761
00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:01,350
settle at a certain time but it's

762
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,390
continuously settled until there's a

763
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:06,990
dispute and then it's settled on change

764
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:08,810
which is not continuous okay so that's

765
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:12,870
lightning

766
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:18,840
we don't have liquid because that's

767
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:20,549
booked stream part to do but it would be

768
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,860
like on chain basically but you can also

769
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:26,690
have combinations like you can combine

770
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:30,750
these options challenges that's

771
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:32,100
important one which we actually see now

772
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,590
there might be of course different

773
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:37,080
challenges but I would like to address

774
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,820
this the not only is challenges but the

775
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,230
flipside of a challenge is also always

776
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,790
opportunity right so we think that

777
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,910
solving for companies that would like to

778
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:51,060
join this solving these challenges gives

779
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:53,600
you the opportunity to maybe monetize

780
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:56,009
the whole thing so first one is

781
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,290
discovery and matching so imagine the

782
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,180
contract between to Alice and Bob they

783
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,700
can write it on paper here or they can

784
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,799
use the app the

785
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,899
trouble becomes when Bob says okay I'm

786
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,470
done halfway through the contract hidden

787
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,970
he disappears now Ellis is left with you

788
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,669
no leverage long position and she

789
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:16,669
doesn't have the dollars right so she

790
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:18,410
ideally would need not even to know that

791
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,480
Bob's gone because he's immediately

792
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:23,240
replaced by somebody else so there's and

793
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,500
that gives you need to have liquidity

794
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,270
and discovery

795
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:30,770
so that discovery can be automatic

796
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,740
decentralized and that's the difficult

797
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:34,910
part of it to do it in a trust less

798
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:38,450
decentralized way so that you don't have

799
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:40,879
a centralized or a book so that Pierce

800
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,740
can find each other so discovery and

801
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,110
it's different in lightning and the

802
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,700
different on shines but on chain we

803
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:50,840
thought like okay easy discovery

804
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,370
telegram channel just discovery of peers

805
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,560
that want to do business and then you

806
00:38:52,370 --> 00:39:05,270
take the app and then you you can enter

807
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:09,020
into the contract if you check a swap

808
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:10,940
way of doing it it's for aetherium you

809
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:14,390
have an order book blog a local or the

810
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:19,540
book and you connect give a local server

811
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:22,879
and you just send the information to

812
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:25,990
whichever or right now it's I believe

813
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,240
its centralized but maybe they will

814
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:35,540
generalize it and it broadcast to the

815
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:37,669
net to the theorem network maybe I can

816
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,940
answer that so we have been thinking

817
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:43,310
about many models so if you do it on top

818
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,870
of Lightning Network you have peers that

819
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:47,060
you're connected to so you can do

820
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:49,130
network discovery basically ask your

821
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:52,160
peers if they cannot provide liquidity

822
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,020
they can ask others and make a fee so

823
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,170
it's the same model as how you discover

824
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,450
channels and and peers and how we route

825
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,760
payments actually so that's one option

826
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:05,000
the problem with this approach of a

827
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,580
centralized server is that they can be

828
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,600
regulated so so we would like to avoid

829
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:12,860
any you know server that provides an

830
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,640
order maybe it there's a business

831
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,070
opportunity for someone doing it

832
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,440
in a centralized way I personally think

833
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,810
it's a bad idea to even try because they

834
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,790
will regulate it right away and then you

835
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:30,450
have to feel feel yes exactly and

836
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:32,910
there's also a global way by announcing

837
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:36,450
it so you can you can say okay

838
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:38,700
there will be an order book but we will

839
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:42,359
collect it in a decentralized way so in

840
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:44,580
a way we create peer-to-peer network but

841
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,470
it will kind of converge on one order

842
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,240
book so that's another way to do it I

843
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:52,859
don't know what's the best way right now

844
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:56,490
but thankfully we have options to choose

845
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:58,650
from not not you know waiting for

846
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:01,200
someone to figure it out so if no one

847
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:05,550
figures it out we will pick one way and

848
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,830
try that one thanks so yeah there was

849
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:10,770
discovery and matching now liquidity

850
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:14,910
sharing is very closely connected to

851
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:17,310
scale and that's important topic so once

852
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:19,799
bob goes away it needs to be replaced by

853
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,529
somebody or if alice wants to have a

854
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,680
bigger position than bob has his funds

855
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:28,080
for then the position could be compiled

856
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,790
from two peers or three pairs so you

857
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,549
need to be able to route liquidity

858
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:34,200
routing anything enlightening has its

859
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,510
challenges you know the routine you

860
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,700
don't chain has its own as you say

861
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,920
there's a lot of things to do to do a

862
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:44,040
simple thing like the routing liquidity

863
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,590
and sharing it across the network in a

864
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,150
decentralized manner but it can be done

865
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,950
there's a read the paper on the

866
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:55,080
lightning that's interesting for that

867
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:56,580
too it's doable but you need to then we

868
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,620
think the best way and that's why we

869
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:02,400
will be releasing all the papers open

870
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:04,830
source to get the community bullet and

871
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,200
figure out the best way out how to do it

872
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:09,750
and then once though once the best

873
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,390
models will crystallize then also the

874
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:14,660
monetization models will crystallize but

875
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,740
we need more brains to get this done so

876
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,740
liquidity sharing and scaling very

877
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:22,109
important thing we're actually one of

878
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,120
the liquidity scaling options we thought

879
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,260
like to suck liquidity the the vacuum

880
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,960
cleaner we thought like okay we'll

881
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:31,050
connect it to bit max

882
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,620
yeah because bit max is Dave use case

883
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,630
right

884
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:37,230
he knows the stuff and there's a lot of

885
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:39,300
Dave's on bit max now they know they're

886
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:43,350
Verdes then they know everything so we

887
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:46,020
for life okay so this is the pipe and

888
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:48,960
we'll just draw it like like trees on

889
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,940
bit max said but it's still alive this

890
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,530
idea but it could work and but then you

891
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,740
have you can have more of these like

892
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:58,110
engine entrance points how to suck the

893
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:01,919
liquidity into into this into the system

894
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:03,990
so that's so what what I like about it

895
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,680
is you can have specialization and you

896
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:09,720
can have people who have a brokerage

897
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,940
account for example and they they can

898
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:17,220
sell you stock and make money on their

899
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:20,970
own their fees so so you really people

900
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:23,819
can specialize in being Dave's and and

901
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:25,890
actually making money just by providing

902
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:28,530
access to the liquidity that they have

903
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:31,259
access to so and it's really powerful a

904
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:34,320
lot of holders are Alice's right they

905
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,500
need dollar liquidity now if you really

906
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,620
plug it to bit max for all the days now

907
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,420
there's download liquidity and these

908
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:46,319
guys know how to hedge right so very

909
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:48,270
natural for them and then okay so and

910
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,730
the third one is the price and arbiter

911
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:52,860
trust lessness we touched on that we

912
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:55,640
need to be that's it's super important

913
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:57,900
point when you go decentralized because

914
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,810
everything what's decentralized is made

915
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:05,430
for the environment where people don't

916
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:08,220
don't trust each other so even a

917
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:11,549
federation of five or six is it's better

918
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:13,470
but it's not it's it's not there so so

919
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:16,230
that that point is probably the weakest

920
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:19,200
part of everything like the price feeds

921
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:21,210
and and and arbiters or solving how to

922
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,919
do the disputes if you need an arbiter

923
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:26,160
or not in different implementations you

924
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,230
don't even need the arbiter so there's a

925
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,569
third one fourth one

926
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:34,350
I think if somebody mentioned compliance

927
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:37,710
here or regulations that's an important

928
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,940
one but of course nobody know and we

929
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,770
don't have a crystal ball what's gonna

930
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,780
happen I just read two days ago that FCA

931
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:45,520
in UK wants to

932
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:52,880
open-source software developers yeah

933
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:58,730
yeah read it out yeah FCA in UK yeah but

934
00:44:52,880 --> 00:45:04,760
yeah it's a it's in this concept it's

935
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:06,560
quite tricky when he and drawing on my

936
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,510
vintage experience we've done a lot of

937
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,690
work with lawyers and I spend a lot of

938
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:16,640
talks to Czech National Bank so

939
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:19,900
regulation is no-go thing but oh it's if

940
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,900
you were to say it's everywhere the same

941
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:30,140
but I think for this ecosystem to grow

942
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:32,150
it's not just about not being compliant

943
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,890
we can be compliant but that doesn't

944
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:36,350
mean we have to use k VAR c in different

945
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:38,990
models most of them cannot be monetized

946
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:40,520
because if you charge for something

947
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:42,770
you're in a different position but if

948
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,440
you stay in a peer-to-peer mode if you

949
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:48,070
go as much trustless and decentralized

950
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,140
as you can if you solve the issue of

951
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:53,900
actually creating derivatives it's like

952
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,790
one key here is if I enter with you

953
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:58,100
right into derivative contract on paper

954
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,690
here right now and we come here next

955
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:03,049
week and settle it's a derivative

956
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:06,980
contract but nobody can regulate us if

957
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:08,870
we code an app open source he downloads

958
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:11,090
it I downloaded and instead of a paper

959
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:12,410
we just put it into the app and we meet

960
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,690
here next week again or actually we

961
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,370
don't have to maybe if we connect it so

962
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,790
nobody can regulate us

963
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:25,100
there's no ki CMR if you multiply this

964
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:29,770
to a network can't be regulated when you

965
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:32,240
start sharing and transferring

966
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:34,490
re-routing liquidity and you make it a

967
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,859
business it's a different thing okay so

968
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:38,959
that there are points where you have

969
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:42,290
your closer or further from regulation

970
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,930
so yeah but there is a way most probably

971
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:47,810
how to do as much as you can without the

972
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:49,040
KYC ml and on the outer edges of it

973
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,779
where there's going to be a lot of

974
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,430
liquidity like from institutions they

975
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,890
could be bridges where part of that

976
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,850
ecosystem is actually regulated through

977
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,730
kyc m and

978
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:59,810
not it's not mutually exclusive these

979
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:02,770
two they can live together

980
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:05,660
most probably since the fourth one and

981
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:08,900
yeah and figuring figuring out the

982
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:11,089
business model how to make money it's

983
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:14,150
difficult on in more difficult problem

984
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:16,840
on over Bitcoin ecosystem but we believe

985
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:19,040
that these at least these pain points

986
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,230
actually give you opportunity how to

987
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,000
monetize it how to solve those things

988
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,620
once you it's very variable for the

989
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:31,330
whole ecosystem one it's variable you

990
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:33,220
can charge for it yeah we're on time

991
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:36,170
perfect

992
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:42,310
so do we have time for questions didn't

993
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:42,310
check hopefully a few questions yes I

994
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,990
admit I don't fully understand it this

995
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,510
might be a silly question but do you

996
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:52,970
imagine separate iterations of this

997
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:55,430
having their own varying interest rates

998
00:47:52,970 --> 00:48:00,379
or would it be standard across the

999
00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:02,899
entire ecosystem no it's it's it's not

1000
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:08,480
it's not a platform it's not a protocol

1001
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:13,430
it's wait here so I do contract with

1002
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:17,180
your I with 10% PA with you or $4 with

1003
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:20,569
you I'll do because I need I don't know

1004
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:23,299
Franks and you value it more you give me

1005
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:26,270
15% I'm a fine with this if for every

1006
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:29,530
contract every peer relationship can

1007
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:32,900
have a different interest rate and an

1008
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:35,600
aggregate the whole market will reveal a

1009
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,310
more acute interest rate which you will

1010
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,140
then look probably look in the absolute

1011
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:42,200
okay it's a it so out of eight point

1012
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:45,440
five or something is a market will

1013
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:48,890
decide it's it's it's not set by the

1014
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:55,070
protocol or by this you said about the

1015
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:58,160
karate collateral what percent I mean on

1016
00:48:55,070 --> 00:49:00,290
a theorem with this in dyes 125 percent

1017
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,730
it's yeah it's not workable same like

1018
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:07,490
this if I enter it with your I bitcoin

1019
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:08,510
dollar and we agree on 30 percent

1020
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:10,160
collateral and I'm

1021
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:12,500
fine with this because I know that it

1022
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,629
will cover the volatility if the market

1023
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,360
goes against him and I want to be sure

1024
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:20,180
that I get the kollel I'm fine with with

1025
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:22,190
with the colleague over there we can say

1026
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:25,399
okay that's it's a different story we go

1027
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:26,960
45 the same thing every contract will

1028
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,920
have it in a different way and in

1029
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:33,740
aggregate the market will reveal the the

1030
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,380
market standard what is important here

1031
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:38,540
is that if you run out of collateral you

1032
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,850
get kicked out of the contract and you

1033
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:43,820
need to find another peer so there's no

1034
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:46,940
risk there's not a lot of risk if you

1035
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:49,550
continuously settle for example if

1036
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:52,310
you're just are losing collateral and

1037
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:54,200
then you run out of it then goodbye your

1038
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:56,450
position is closed and I find another

1039
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,419
peer to open the position so it's not as

1040
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:02,060
important it's it's the same in in

1041
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:05,930
decentralize derivative markets like bit

1042
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:07,580
max you know you there's probably one

1043
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:10,310
percent requirement or something like

1044
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:13,880
that but you know if you run out of it

1045
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:19,000
then and you need to either put more or

1046
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,000
or get kicked out yeah

1047
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:29,470
what about liquidations when in the

1048
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:33,950
contract when contracts is going against

1049
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:36,890
one of their peers and there's not

1050
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:43,069
enough collateral to to fund the

1051
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:44,900
opposite side what's them so it's very

1052
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:47,750
good question different implementation

1053
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:50,710
different implications very different I

1054
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:53,900
guess if let's say we're in the unchain

1055
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:55,760
implementation then and we come here

1056
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:59,240
with your I next Sunday

1057
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,940
then I know okay Bitcoin can move 20% or

1058
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:05,029
30% so my minimum would be okay I need

1059
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:09,670
50% of the collateral unless to do

1060
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:12,410
business with with your eyes so his

1061
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:14,420
motivation is to keep the collateral at

1062
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:15,799
a level not that the minimum level but

1063
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,330
at the level that the contract states

1064
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,230
because he wants to go along Bitcoin

1065
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:23,180
right so he wants to be exposed to it of

1066
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:27,790
course it can happen that the markets

1067
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:32,720
faster and there's not enough collateral

1068
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:34,850
so here in unchain you either have there

1069
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,549
enough or you have to have ability to

1070
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:39,110
get to that remaining collateral as fast

1071
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:43,430
as you can and that's the trade-off

1072
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:45,290
which I had here is every layer gives

1073
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:50,890
you different speed and different cost

1074
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:53,360
and and these will influence the

1075
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:55,580
concrete implementation here and the

1076
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:58,130
level of the collateral while on

1077
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:59,569
lightning if we do continuous settlement

1078
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:02,900
that collateral could be just super

1079
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:05,420
small because liquid you have you're

1080
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,910
covering one second excess movement so

1081
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:10,940
not a week so in the own chain I would

1082
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:13,580
have to have a lot in lightning I would

1083
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:16,250
just have a little and if there's more

1084
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:18,740
piers and enough liquidity I know that

1085
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,780
if he doesn't deliver the margin I'm

1086
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,790
instantly switched to somebody else and

1087
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,680
you and re-enter the contract with

1088
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:27,080
somebody else so different

1089
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:31,009
implementation is different implication

1090
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:35,930
to margin thank you

1091
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:39,140
okay maybe a last question just a short

1092
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:41,379
but note the simple and I don't know why

1093
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:46,790
should direct the question

1094
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:51,890
yes dr. M perhaps early codes that you

1095
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:54,790
can play with for Unchained contracts no

1096
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,790
thanks

1097
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,839
well for DLCs there is there is the

1098
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:05,730
implementation of the squid law

1099
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:07,529
contracts from the MIT elite so you can

1100
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:10,950
play with that it's not further that is

1101
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:13,589
though but you can you can write your

1102
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:15,509
own price Oracle which distributes the

1103
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:19,890
funds and it's quite easy to get there

1104
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:22,559
if you if you want okay so yeah this is

1105
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:25,710
contact information for Patrick that we

1106
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:30,359
have a white paper and everything what I

1107
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:35,130
really like about spending time with

1108
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:38,640
these two guys is that they have a very

1109
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:40,799
interesting vision and I think we can

1110
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:46,049
build it and it will be very useful so

1111
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:48,089
so the more I dig into it I see a very

1112
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:52,829
nice light at the end of the tunnel so

1113
00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:56,220
it's not just you know getting rich fast

1114
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:59,940
but but you can build some useful stuff

1115
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:03,419
stuff on top of Bitcoin and so that's

1116
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:06,660
very exciting for me and if you're

1117
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:11,880
interested I hope you join the project

1118
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:13,828
and now I think I should invite you to

1119
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,799
the closing speech and the party so

1120
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:19,069
thank you Patrick for your interesting

1121
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:19,069
cult

1122
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:24,770
I think we're finished in this room for

1123
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,770
now

1124
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,940
you
