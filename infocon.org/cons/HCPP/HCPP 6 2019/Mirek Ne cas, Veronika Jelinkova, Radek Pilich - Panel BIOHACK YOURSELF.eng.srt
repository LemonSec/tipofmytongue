[Music]

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,680
I would like to welcome you to the

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,350
biohacking panel and a lot of people in

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,390
the previous Congress were asking what

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,670
does biohacking have to do with the

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,610
topics that we talk about here which is

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,970
freedom cryptocurrencies and all this

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:48,180
interesting stuff and there will be more

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,860
by liking dogs at this year's conference

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,210
but I would like to tell you what I

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,700
think is what is the relationship

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,010
between biohacking and the other topics

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,700
of this conference and I think that we

15
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:07,200
are all trying to increase our freedom

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:09,270
our liberty and Liberty starts in our

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,729
bodies if we cannot use them if it

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,479
doesn't work the way we want to if we

19
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,990
are too tired or if we cannot get good

20
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:22,580
enough sleep then our freedom or Liberty

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,000
to do anything else is affected a lot so

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:29,130
I think this is something that at least

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,460
a lot of people in power police in

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,440
Bratislava are interested in we have a

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,399
biohacking

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:43,039
cafeteria which is also here in in

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,700
Prague the Bitcoin coffee suffering

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,930
biohacking drinks and other stuff so

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:53,610
first of all let me introduce our

30
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,310
panelists today actually I would like

31
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,650
them to introduce themselves so we

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,850
recognize veronika elenco and radically

33
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:13,590
please tell us something about you what

34
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:14,310
you do sure thanks nice to be here I'm

35
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,690
so excited

36
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:23,130
hi Akers so my name is Marie some nachos

37
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:26,239
my background is pro sports I'm great as

38
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:30,120
a teacher so I'm working with elite

39
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,270
sportsmen for example red googles some

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,950
national team some national guys and

41
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:41,720
my my core is energy management so this

42
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:47,880
is mainly what I am focused in by liking

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:51,180
hi I'm Veronica and I'm a co-founder of

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,470
code of life that is a new platform for

45
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:58,770
biohackers and we are actually just

46
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:01,770
started so it's pretty fresh part of our

47
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,870
project is also the by hackers Center

48
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,230
which is gonna be very similar to the

49
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:10,380
house of but I only polish just the same

50
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:14,510
vision that is freedom but a slightly

51
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:18,030
different concept and I specialize in

52
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:20,519
sleep so sleep hacking this is my

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,260
passion and because I always had

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,710
problems with sleep so that's why I

55
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,760
studied that and that's why I do some

56
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:31,410
experiments with that

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,410
[Laughter]

58
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:40,799
my name is redic billy and i'm not

59
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:44,700
professionally or semi professionally

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:48,060
involved in by lacking as my colleagues

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,790
are I would call myself an amateur bio

62
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,410
hacker if I would call myself a

63
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:57,769
biohacker I got into bio hacker let's

64
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,930
say some 15 years ago when I started

65
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:04,850
experimenting with various food

66
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:08,490
supplements mostly because of my

67
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,760
sensitivities I used to have whether its

68
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:17,670
sensitivities to food or sensitivities

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:21,899
and this regulation of mood etc so this

70
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:26,460
was like my entry into it and it became

71
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:30,450
sort of hobby for me over time more of a

72
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:33,919
hobby where I can explore various things

73
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:38,240
and learn about how the body works and

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,500
explore worries kind of venues on of how

75
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,080
to do something with it

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,310
via tools and activities and how it

77
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:52,729
responds so it's like

78
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:59,240
interest of mine that keeps me engaged

79
00:04:52,730 --> 00:05:03,060
creatively as well as necessity when I

80
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,490
use it to to help me regulate my moods

81
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,540
and my sensitivities so this would be

82
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,850
probably my topic okay and I'm you right

83
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,350
now I didn't introduce myself in the

84
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:18,600
beginning because I'm here to ask

85
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:21,360
questions but I also started Czech and

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,040
Slovak by hacker group and we managed it

87
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,870
together with Radek so I like to invite

88
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:33,390
people to share their experiences with

89
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:37,140
with biohacking and for those of you who

90
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:39,330
are on the hackers Congress at the

91
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:44,250
hackers Congress and have never heard

92
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:47,639
the word biohacking I would like to

93
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,370
start with this question it was actually

94
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,740
asked by what was La Toja another by a

95
00:05:50,370 --> 00:06:01,740
hacker that I know and he asked me that

96
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:04,169
if if his grandmother is putting MCT oil

97
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,270
into Nescafe if she can call herself a

98
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:08,669
biohacker already or what is the

99
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:12,630
criteria to become a biohacker what is

100
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:15,659
it what does it mean and who is a

101
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:20,820
biohacker so my first question is who do

102
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:23,580
you think is bio hacker so I asked me

103
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,770
who do I think that it's a bio hacker or

104
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,400
what it is by hacking according to me

105
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:31,289
your choice okay so maybe I would start

106
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:38,340
with what bio hacking actually means for

107
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:40,289
me I think it's a very modern term it's

108
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,140
like you know when you ask me what does

109
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:46,440
it mean psychology for myself so it's

110
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:49,650
like a new field but paradoxically

111
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,800
there's nothing new and it's it's a in

112
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:55,049
my opinion it's like a complex or

113
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,530
holistic approach to human health

114
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,130
well-being and performance it's a

115
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:03,429
systematic approach

116
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:07,000
and it's all about personal freedom so

117
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:10,180
you don't have to be a doctor or PhD

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,300
under some institution to become a

119
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,640
biohacker and to heck or optimize your

120
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:20,130
own biology from the conference of your

121
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:25,419
home and I'm fascinated by this because

122
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:27,880
I was very ill and it's my journey but

123
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:34,200
by hacking started ten years ago because

124
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:38,350
of my chronic diseases and when I was

125
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:41,560
waking up in the hospital on a regular

126
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:44,650
basis then there was a point where I

127
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,020
said to myself okay so this is not

128
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,940
working so what can I do you would take

129
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,820
responsibility for my own health and

130
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:55,330
then because I studied behavioral

131
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,909
economics I was close to neuroscience

132
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:01,390
and psychology and all that so then I

133
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:04,390
started with experiments I started with

134
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:07,990
sleep so I started to sleep that was a

135
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:10,450
good start so yeah so I think that this

136
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,440
is by hacking for me and everybody can

137
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:16,630
become a biohacker

138
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:19,000
and see you can see your own biology or

139
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,550
yourself from you know bigger picture

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,680
and to experiment to test because I

141
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,220
don't believe in that there is one truth

142
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,220
for all

143
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,630
so by hacking it's not about recipes

144
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,539
it's about you know when you teach

145
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,299
somebody to cook you teach principles

146
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,400
but you don't give the recipe read the

147
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,260
recipes and I think that's by hacking

148
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,809
that you actually learn yourself the

149
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,060
principles about you like what does it

150
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,160
mean to be human not only from the

151
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,540
physical philosophical point of view but

152
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,969
also from the biological point of view I

153
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:58,930
think it relates to my original answer

154
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:04,150
to this question which was another

155
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:06,910
question if anyone with and I with a

156
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:10,600
with a phone who can take a picture are

157
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:13,510
they already photographer and the answer

158
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,960
is you need to ask the person if they

159
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,970
feel

160
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,190
like a photographer so I think biohacker

161
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,970
is anyone who feels like a biohacker

162
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:27,250
so I don't think we need a strict

163
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:31,660
definition but why I asked this question

164
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:36,970
why I introduced it is for the audience

165
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:39,370
for other people to kind of be able to

166
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,190
grasp what it means what we are talking

167
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:44,580
about so so maybe I would rephrase it

168
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,550
for me like a little bit

169
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,680
what does biohacker do what would our

170
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,270
their actions what what is the

171
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,180
difference between someone who would

172
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:59,050
call him or herself biohacker and

173
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:02,550
someone who doesn't yeah I'm thinking oh

174
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:06,160
I think by looking what is it

175
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,829
and they on the left hand we see a

176
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,089
freedom on the right hand we see a

177
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:15,130
discipline for me it's very necessary to

178
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:18,700
think about my life about my energy and

179
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:21,189
if I want to be more freedom I must be

180
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,920
more disciplined for it

181
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:30,220
for example biohacker preparing or

182
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,979
tuning or hacking exterior things in

183
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,460
your environment for example for good

184
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:41,530
sleep routine so change for example the

185
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:45,250
color of the lights and on the other

186
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:49,170
hand the either inner environment for

187
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:55,300
example in my microbiome so there are

188
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:57,810
two sides of one coin so and the

189
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:02,740
definition or I like the frost

190
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:05,500
biohacking his ancient wisdom combined

191
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,250
with Western medicine for example Asian

192
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,470
wisdom some pranayama breathing

193
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:15,180
techniques it's so I don't know exactly

194
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:18,370
freeze over 3,000 years ago known and

195
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:22,089
now we can measure a brainwaves for

196
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:24,370
example maybe 50 years or I don't know

197
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:27,730
exactly so combining these two things

198
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:30,999
but leading to be more successful

199
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:34,359
to be more energic give me more happier

200
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:37,899
that's for me by liking so habits

201
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:41,100
discipline on the one hand and it leads

202
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:45,399
to be more freedom people for example I

203
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:48,129
would maybe at that it's also about

204
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,589
looking at the environment in the way it

205
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:54,009
used to be so for example these days

206
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:57,970
someone taking ice baths or cold showers

207
00:11:54,009 --> 00:12:00,279
would consider it biohacking and you

208
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,259
know three thousand years ago having an

209
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:10,629
ice bath was the only bath you could

210
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:14,889
have no okay so also looking at the

211
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:18,609
relationship between Palio which is kind

212
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:21,129
of living according to how we evolved in

213
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:23,019
the ancient environment and looking how

214
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:26,379
the current environment is different

215
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:28,929
would would that be something that's I

216
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:31,089
think personally I think that is

217
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:33,608
something that biohacker go to would

218
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:37,379
kind of compare current living

219
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:41,339
conditions and see if if they're

220
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:44,139
matching what what their body needs

221
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:50,949
sorry

222
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:56,289
so I basically I just edited that kind

223
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:59,258
of understanding that our bodies evolved

224
00:12:56,289 --> 00:13:02,139
in different environment which was a few

225
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:04,149
thousand years ago and it's not

226
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:08,049
necessarily fine-tuned for current

227
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:13,199
environment so the question is if a

228
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:16,799
biohacker tries to adapt his environment

229
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:19,149
to his body to what the body needs so

230
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,980
probably the answer is yes but that's

231
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:29,589
what what I thought I would add to your

232
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:33,699
definition okay thanks I think so for me

233
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:37,299
biohacking personally it's as I

234
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:41,510
mentioned before similarly to Veronica

235
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:46,029
it was and still is a way to

236
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:48,740
self medicate myself basically after

237
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:53,540
experiences with the current medical

238
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:56,149
system which often claimed me to be

239
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,250
healthy with everything in check

240
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:02,060
although I was experiencing many

241
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:05,089
symptoms and I'm by working was for me a

242
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:10,089
way to to learn about myself and to

243
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:14,420
learn about human biology and to create

244
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:17,570
hypotheses and do experiments and slowly

245
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,839
but surely often unsuccessfully move

246
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:25,959
forward somehow and as I said before

247
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:31,190
it's also a hobby a passion where I M

248
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:36,410
where I find a way to to to be

249
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:39,079
explorative to seek some novelty and get

250
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:43,699
this sort of satisfaction where I learn

251
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:47,120
through feedback and create basically

252
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:51,019
tools and approaches for myself that I

253
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,889
can use on on daily basis in in worried

254
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:57,529
situations so based on this for me bio

255
00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:03,279
hacking is really about mostly about

256
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:08,060
tools and activities that can be used to

257
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:12,620
let's say first of all learn about how

258
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:15,619
our body functions then to to monitor

259
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,350
what is the current state or what is our

260
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:22,399
tendency where are we moving and then

261
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:26,269
finally to to somehow intervene into it

262
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,060
and help the body or push the body in

263
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:34,490
the direction we want it to go in the

264
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:40,149
current situation I think sorry if I if

265
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:46,519
I may add one more thing like generally

266
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:51,040
it's currently accepted and easy to kind

267
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:54,649
of imagine that biohacking ism means to

268
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,540
be energetic be more productive

269
00:15:54,649 --> 00:16:02,279
sleep better and do these things that

270
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:05,849
are kind of like obvious and kind of

271
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:10,170
fulfil the criteria of what the current

272
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:12,680
time and age demands of us but I also

273
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:17,209
think that for many people it might be

274
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:21,180
simpler to love what's a increasing the

275
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:25,099
hedonistic experience this day they they

276
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:33,258
have in life or like for me learning and

277
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:36,930
exploring what happens if great I liked

278
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:41,940
that you mentioned experiments and I

279
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:44,189
would like to say what I think the

280
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:48,269
difference is between medical approach

281
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:51,690
medicine and biohacking so there are

282
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:54,329
basically in my opinion two most

283
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:58,230
important distinctions one is experiment

284
00:16:54,329 --> 00:17:00,599
so in medicine you are doing things that

285
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:04,140
are based on studies on hundreds of

286
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:10,370
thousands of people and you are trying

287
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:15,270
to prescribe medical interventions that

288
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:18,719
that are generally accepted as usable

289
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:24,619
with biohacking you're experimenting on

290
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:26,970
the subset of one which is you or me and

291
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:29,610
that means that by hackers are

292
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,190
experimenters and if something works for

293
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,649
them it doesn't necessarily need to work

294
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,280
for anyone else so it's a it's a very

295
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:42,929
experimental and personal approach and

296
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:49,980
the second thing which I got from my ex

297
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:53,940
talk that was my impression was that we

298
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,590
are not only trying to be healthy we are

299
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,270
trying to be more than healthy we're

300
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:02,820
trying to be to be somehow better so

301
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:05,460
medicine you know if also as you said

302
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,509
you know if you're in check if all the

303
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,090
results are green and older

304
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:14,149
all the test results are normal then

305
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:18,709
they send you home and you're fine you

306
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:25,879
can live your life and biohacking for me

307
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:30,049
is some is recognizing that that's not

308
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:34,099
enough and we can do better we can have

309
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:40,039
more energy or be more relaxed or be

310
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:43,059
more creative and we are looking for

311
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:48,999
ways to improve ourselves even beyond

312
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:55,489
being healthy even we want more of life

313
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:58,309
so my next question dies too we want to

314
00:18:55,489 --> 00:19:00,679
add something in my opinion thanks in my

315
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:03,678
open air mates for example in in today's

316
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,599
and 21st century you see we we have so

317
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,479
many possibilities in so many

318
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,499
disciplines and for me by working kids

319
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:15,710
it's it's it might choose lifestyle I

320
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:19,849
choose my life I want to be responsible

321
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:24,950
to my body because is the really my only

322
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:27,739
weight other stuff there's nothing your

323
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,529
body my body is my opinion my mind my

324
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:34,419
spirit these free combinations it's my

325
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:37,729
world this is Viking

326
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:39,919
so you're basically improving your

327
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:42,139
wealth by biohacking because you're

328
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,559
improving your only wealth that you have

329
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:47,359
which is your body mind and spirit

330
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,799
so I really like that that's really

331
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:56,599
resonates with me so I would like to ask

332
00:19:50,799 --> 00:20:00,229
in a practical way because this

333
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:06,639
conference is about freedom and if you

334
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:11,430
are already healthy how us by liking

335
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:14,669
improve your freedom and if you have a

336
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:20,340
a specific example that would be better

337
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:22,590
from your experience for me just to give

338
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:27,090
you an example what I'm looking for when

339
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:32,070
I stopped eating gluten I realized that

340
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:39,570
I have more energy I'm I was not so

341
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:44,129
bloated I I felt better and and I even

342
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:49,409
lost some weight so I felt better in my

343
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:52,320
body and that also meant because I had

344
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:56,520
more energy that I could create more

345
00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:01,200
other things so basically it allowed me

346
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:06,500
to use my time better and that increased

347
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:08,220
my wealth in form of energy and also

348
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,120
also freedom

349
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,670
so maybe Veronica if you can what what

350
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:20,699
biohack increased your freedom for

351
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:24,150
example largely because I started with

352
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:29,880
pain so I had a pain and I was ill and

353
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:33,090
then I started to be healthier and I

354
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,470
realized wow I don't have a brain

355
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,970
that's great

356
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:40,830
you know then because you adapt you you

357
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,710
adapt to the environment and to

358
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,030
everything so then you know you wake up

359
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,960
in the morning and you don't realize

360
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:51,930
that you are feeling sorry for people

361
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,690
who don't know what is brain okay

362
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:57,720
so simply you can imagine that that you

363
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:04,520
are tired and you have like you feel a

364
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:08,370
little bit dizzy in a simple way so

365
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:11,550
basically biohacking increased my

366
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,919
freedom in a way that when I started to

367
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:16,980
have a pain then I moved to the to be

368
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:22,710
healthy and from that point you are like

369
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:25,250
wow so how far can I go and then you

370
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:29,539
realize it's neverending story

371
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:32,270
and the more you heck yourself the

372
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:34,250
better you feel then you go back again

373
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,918
because you fail many times and

374
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:40,370
obviously we're humans but then you go

375
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:44,870
more in deep and deep and now I can say

376
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:47,629
that when I feel stressed I know what to

377
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:50,209
do because I know my body better then I

378
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:54,850
knew 10 years ago so I know that I can

379
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:57,380
use some adaptogen herbs for example or

380
00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:02,360
that I can use some breathing techniques

381
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:05,240
or that I can do some ice-cold exposures

382
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:10,399
or whatever but I know what works for me

383
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:14,750
and what doesn't so since since I play

384
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,750
with this I actually I don't go to

385
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:21,350
doctors I don't go to hospitals I go

386
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:23,030
either to just get some blood tests but

387
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,350
I don't need the doctor to explain me

388
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,120
what the blood test means because I've

389
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:28,010
learned the marker is what it means and

390
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,939
what kind of markers I should measure

391
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:35,809
for myself but I'm not saying that

392
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:40,070
doctors are bad they're good for you

393
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:42,678
know if I break my leg I'm not gonna buy

394
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,870
a hack that I'll probably go to the

395
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,770
hospital and ask for help but I'm

396
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:52,760
talking about chronic illnesses or

397
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:56,350
prevention mainly so yeah I think that

398
00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:01,129
it mainly increase my freedom because I

399
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:02,330
more understand myself paradoxically

400
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,270
sometimes it happens I don't know

401
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:08,780
anything and I am in a rabbit hole and

402
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:11,330
I'm like why I'm here again but you know

403
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,250
when you appear there then you know that

404
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:16,189
you have some tools you're not there for

405
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,100
years but you're there for days for

406
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,929
example and then you can go even deeper

407
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:24,770
so it's not like that your life will be

408
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:29,740
forever beautiful and pink and amazing

409
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,740
but the mindset changes

410
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:40,040
oh the question is about is leasing

411
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:44,809
freedom right yeah so I will keep it

412
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:49,350
practical let's say talking about

413
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:51,990
sensitivities people might have if you

414
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:55,439
are sensitive to the environment around

415
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:59,000
you because here I said this is very

416
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,040
much unnatural to human biology and

417
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,230
those of us that are sensitive might

418
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:11,040
often find it overwhelming and taxing to

419
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:13,170
an extent that we avoid certain

420
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,570
situation and certain environments just

421
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:21,840
to not be so taxed by it

422
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:27,059
so I went through a period of let's say

423
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:30,990
stress burnout in my life and after you

424
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:34,379
know like getting distance from the way

425
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,200
I was living before I started noticing

426
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,900
the contrasts which I haven't noticed

427
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,460
before like for example when you walk

428
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:47,250
into the metro in park or if you go to

429
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:51,000
the city center in Prague if you have

430
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:54,570
distanced yourself from it you kind of

431
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,429
feel how stressful it is suddenly it's a

432
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,580
contrast you haven't noticed before but

433
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:01,890
now suddenly because you have in a way

434
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:05,939
from it I can feel it

435
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:08,809
so like once you once I experience

436
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:14,040
things like that I can start looking for

437
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:17,960
how to reduce these sort of stressors so

438
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:23,820
that I don't get so text or so I don't

439
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:26,760
get annoyed and I don't lose my energy

440
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:29,669
necessarily so for example if I go to

441
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,950
the city center now and I if I have to I

442
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:35,340
don't know run some errands and go to

443
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:38,670
four places spend four hours there

444
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:42,600
arranging something it's better for me

445
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:46,230
to take like the musician earplugs you

446
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:51,928
use for concerts put them into my ears

447
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:55,230
and this reduction in the noise keeps me

448
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:59,130
much more energized and much more

449
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:02,970
focused and generally provides me much

450
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:05,240
better experience so that environment is

451
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:09,150
suddenly much more acceptable

452
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,220
similarly working on the computer if I

453
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:14,190
have to work on the computer for the

454
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:19,890
whole days on days at the end it's

455
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:23,250
better for me to take classes that plug

456
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:26,910
the blue light that is emitted from the

457
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:30,720
monitor that makes my eyes tired and use

458
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:33,870
them in the afternoon so again I have

459
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,710
more energy and less fatigue and these

460
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:41,909
are like easy things easy tools I can

461
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:54,390
have on hand and use them to to reduce

462
00:27:41,910 --> 00:28:02,150
the sensitivities I have I think your

463
00:27:54,390 --> 00:28:05,460
microphone doesn't work yeah sure thanks

464
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:10,070
so I repeat it once more by working for

465
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:14,280
me is not only a lifestyle but such a

466
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:17,700
five years ago I started by working as a

467
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:21,139
vacation so in my consultation I am

468
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:23,790
working with managers and at least and

469
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:27,900
so this is one point and the second

470
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:30,379
point maybe I take one example the

471
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,380
freedom for example in your body

472
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,700
everybody needs more energy is it right

473
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:39,150
give me give me an answer do you want

474
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:42,840
more energy please okay you are here

475
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:49,080
thanks ok so imagine we have to end

476
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:51,750
Giants in our body one in China is it's

477
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,260
sorry it's very primitive I don't say it

478
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:59,700
in English very very well so imaging to

479
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:03,420
enjoins one is for sugar everybody

480
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:08,430
is prepared for sugar glucose ATP energy

481
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:10,950
and so on so if you end it the sugar

482
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:13,620
angina you are empty

483
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:17,790
you are no you have no energy is it

484
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:25,469
right you know the states such a brain

485
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:27,920
for core we'd say in English we take the

486
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:30,930
the hunger when you want to kill someone

487
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:34,050
I think it's uh mark I think is it some

488
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:36,650
jokes so and imagine you have the second

489
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:41,100
angina the fat angina

490
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:46,740
how many people are using the fat as a

491
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:52,740
primary fuel for your body okay nice and

492
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:55,350
the rest okay so the freedom is

493
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:59,790
something what we called metabolic

494
00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:04,969
flexibility because if my sugar angina

495
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:09,149
stops and I train my body to the fat

496
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:13,680
I've know these states as kill somebody

497
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:18,720
for some sneakers or so on because I

498
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:22,050
switch my enjoying so there's a reason

499
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:26,760
for me why by working helps for example

500
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:31,409
in in freedom okay thank you

501
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:34,230
i I think you answered also my next

502
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:41,300
question so we will have more time but I

503
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:44,250
would like to ask you to so in in many

504
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:47,669
hex in life in life hacking we are

505
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:52,350
looking for part of principles so what

506
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:55,140
is the 20% that we can do to have 80%

507
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:58,439
effect so what is the most impactful

508
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:02,270
change that we can do and most

509
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,880
biohackers would mention at least

510
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:08,580
nutrition exercise and sleep

511
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,200
you mentioned nutrition and metabolic

512
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,080
flexibility I think that's very

513
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:17,880
important and for most people if they

514
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:22,439
get this right it's 80% of their of the

515
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:25,950
result I don't know if you agree but of

516
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:29,700
course unless you damage something and

517
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:32,309
and you have other problem veronica has

518
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:36,179
been hacking sleep and sleep is also

519
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:38,940
very important so tell us how you hacked

520
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:42,360
sleep and what what does it mean to

521
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:46,800
experiment in sleep you know do you go

522
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:50,340
to bed early and sleep one hour longer

523
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:54,030
or what does it mean to improve this and

524
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:56,370
how to do it well from me hacking sleep

525
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,830
it's not about sleeping longer but it's

526
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:02,909
about to hack the quality of my sleep

527
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:05,178
because sometimes I don't have the

528
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:10,200
opportunity to sleep eight or nine hours

529
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:11,820
sometimes I sleep four or five hours not

530
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,590
saying it's optimal but for me I know

531
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:18,000
how it works and you know from my own

532
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:20,100
biology and very specifically I do a lot

533
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,780
of experiments and I would say that my

534
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:26,399
favorite one is so you first of all okay

535
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,800
we can start from the beginning like you

536
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,340
should have a hack your bedroom and into

537
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,460
blue light like you said then I have a

538
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,439
gravity blanket for example at home have

539
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,350
you ever heard about that about gravity

540
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,950
blanket I used it for two nights and I

541
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:48,030
don't like it really I have one extra if

542
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:50,510
someone wants well for me it's a magic

543
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:53,879
it's a major blanket basically it's a

544
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,129
10% of your body weight so it's quite

545
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:01,230
heavy

546
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:03,210
mine is six kilos and it's it's I mean

547
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,640
you can you cannot travel with that it's

548
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,630
quite impractical but when I'm at home

549
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:12,630
it's like you know you feel mmm some

550
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:16,550
sort of like a security she went it was

551
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:20,090
designed for autistic kids and then

552
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:23,010
people just went to the Kickstarter and

553
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:24,800
it seems like a lot of people needed not

554
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,290
only autistic kids

555
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,800
so I think that you know in ancient

556
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:36,440
times or in you know American Indians

557
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:38,690
they used how you call it the the skin

558
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,030
of the the animals you know and all that

559
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:44,110
so it's quite heavy and you feel really

560
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:47,210
secure so this gravity blanket for me

561
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:51,100
apparently not for everybody it's a

562
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:54,920
great hack because I feel the security

563
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:57,290
but so that's that's the one thing then

564
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,040
of course darkness and all that but I

565
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:05,980
wanna actually share with you one

566
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:09,529
specific tools that I use and that is

567
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:12,949
it's a natural supplements and one of

568
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:16,190
them is mucuna pruriens which is

569
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:19,520
basically well known as a velvet bean

570
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:20,840
used in ayurvedic medicine especially to

571
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,460
treat Parkinson disease

572
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:27,050
have you ever heard about that who has

573
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:33,620
waking appearance yeah so whew

574
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:36,440
great so this velvet bean is its

575
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:40,029
adaptogens so it helps your body handle

576
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:44,960
stress better in a simple try arms and

577
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:47,120
it it is high in l-dopa which is

578
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,949
precursor to dopamine and that is very

579
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:56,659
important for your mood and libido if

580
00:34:51,949 --> 00:35:00,259
you want sex drive focus motivation but

581
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:03,589
also for your sleep so for me these

582
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:07,790
beans I would say that when I measure my

583
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:10,670
my sleep with this little thing I can

584
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:14,480
see that my REM sleep and my deep sleep

585
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:16,910
actually increased by 100% which is for

586
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,620
me incredible because thunder has never

587
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,740
happened before and I could hack it in

588
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:23,240
any kind of way but with this it's

589
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:28,490
really I don't know if it just for me

590
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:32,680
you should try it yourself but it's it's

591
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:36,979
it's very special and with that I use

592
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,750
adaptogenic adaptogens or like you know

593
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,410
helps like rhodiola

594
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:47,210
examples well-known you probably know it

595
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:50,450
mmm and l-tyrosine which is I mean acid

596
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:53,480
and and acetylcysteine which is another

597
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,950
I mean acid so to fix my receptors I

598
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,940
don't want to go too much in deep in

599
00:35:54,950 --> 00:36:01,310
this but I just wanna share that there

600
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:05,180
are you know a lot of toys like this

601
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:08,420
that you can find in nature but those

602
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,990
molecules are also in your brain so when

603
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:17,540
these molecular meets with that that's

604
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:20,209
in your brain you know it's not it's

605
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:23,029
basically very I would say a natural

606
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:25,310
process for for us so for example this

607
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,920
l-dopa that it's in this magic beings

608
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:31,130
it's already the inside of your brain so

609
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,290
what you just do is that you help it's

610
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:36,500
like you have workers outside and you

611
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:38,840
just help to produce your dopamine you

612
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:42,050
know very very very simple I don't

613
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,810
really you know I used to be like I

614
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,850
didn't like any supplements and I was

615
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:51,410
just you know I have to do it by myself

616
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:53,509
and it's enough to just have these cold

617
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,700
exposures and doing these breathing

618
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:57,830
techniques and do meditation and all

619
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:01,669
that and I still do of course and it's

620
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:04,520
great but you know as Merrick said you

621
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:07,550
live in the age or or you stood at it

622
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,950
actually as well you know it's this is

623
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:13,940
not really natural environment for human

624
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:16,939
biology let's face it so we if we wanna

625
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:22,940
be more than healthy I believe that we

626
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:26,000
should or not sure but we can you know

627
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:28,490
experiment and play with supplements or

628
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,620
herbs and especially here in the Czech

629
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:33,470
Republic we have a lot of herbs they are

630
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:37,460
pretty cool so we don't have to use like

631
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:44,299
very expensive nootropic drugs and you

632
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:45,890
know I so I would I think that there it

633
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,240
wouldn't be cool let me talk about the

634
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:52,509
part of the principle I would say that

635
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:55,910
the most important 20% is nutrition

636
00:37:52,510 --> 00:38:01,519
that affects sleep as well exercise of

637
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:03,348
course darkness some you know harmonize

638
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,479
your stress levels and Herrmann's and

639
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:08,269
you can do that with these toys like

640
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,450
with herbes and just play that but I

641
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:15,399
think one important thing is to have a

642
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:19,960
baseline like I started with fasting and

643
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:22,460
you know if you don't know your body

644
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,039
then you can add anything but you're not

645
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:28,519
gonna feel any difference so I started

646
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:30,799
to do fasting and then you mentioned

647
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:34,129
that it is intolerance this as well like

648
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:38,150
then you realize okay so now I can add

649
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:40,190
this food or this but how does it feel

650
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,890
now I can actually see that my body

651
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:47,119
doesn't like it so maybe you know I'm

652
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:49,430
allergic to some of that so I would

653
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,260
start with that so that I know where I

654
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:54,470
am and then I can add some other things

655
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:57,140
and ideally not to mix everything all

656
00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:01,578
together so I have my book of

657
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:03,680
experiments and I track myself and even

658
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:07,400
this velvet bean I don't take more than

659
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,250
four times a week no longer than three

660
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,849
months in a row and then I have you know

661
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:16,220
even half year or even one year I have a

662
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:19,430
break and then I starts of something

663
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:24,339
else so that's really a really good

664
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:28,190
approach and I think that our body's

665
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:33,230
like noise I would say noise randomness

666
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:35,029
so I personally also don't like taking

667
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:40,910
the same supplement every day I think

668
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:44,930
that if you teach your body with more

669
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:48,348
randomness and you allow it to improve

670
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:51,529
and overcompensate and and and that's

671
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:53,809
how you can grow actually so so if

672
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:55,880
someone I wanted to hear that the best

673
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:58,609
biohack is snorting a line of cocaine

674
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:02,599
every morning that's not what I would

675
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:05,929
recommend not judging but that probably

676
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:09,949
would be a very downward slope

677
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:11,329
but what I would like to also add is I

678
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:14,119
really liked how you talked about

679
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:16,699
baseline and the question is how do we

680
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,669
know if it's working and you showed your

681
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:25,039
ring that measures your sleep and your

682
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:29,929
movement and I think for experiments

683
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:32,539
that we do it is a good idea to think

684
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:39,079
about how do I know if it's working

685
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:41,899
because if you read a description of a

686
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:44,689
supplement it has all the benefits cures

687
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:48,469
cancer you have more energy everything

688
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:49,999
and then you pay a lot of money and it

689
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:53,389
supplements and you don't know if it's

690
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:57,529
doing anything so so actually looking at

691
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:59,659
how you can measure if something is

692
00:40:57,529 --> 00:41:03,349
improving and have a working theory of

693
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:06,409
that it's quite important so devices you

694
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:07,819
can use your your smartphone to track

695
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:12,589
your sleep as well if you don't have a

696
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:15,769
ring or watch or or any other device

697
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:21,849
what you can also do is take blood tests

698
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:25,959
also subjective feeling is it's very

699
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:29,539
very useful remember you're not doing

700
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:31,908
experiments that work on hundred

701
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:38,989
thousand people what is important is how

702
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:41,839
you personally feel so so maybe last if

703
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:46,339
you have one last burrito heck and then

704
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:51,649
we can ask the audience if you don't we

705
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:52,519
can ask audience right away okay so to

706
00:41:51,649 --> 00:41:55,808
be short

707
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:58,908
I think sleep is really important for

708
00:41:55,809 --> 00:42:01,249
majority of people probably more

709
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:03,889
important than exercise and nutrition

710
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:08,928
which was quite popular for last decades

711
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:12,559
but sleep now is getting the the focus

712
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:16,639
it deserves and you don't really notice

713
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:19,490
the difference of how impactful asleep

714
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:24,500
can be until you

715
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:27,348
experience it on yourself and ideally

716
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,809
with the benefit of having something

717
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:32,450
like the aura ring or some other sleep

718
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:36,579
monitor that really shows you like

719
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:39,970
what's happening in your sleep and

720
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:43,039
beyond the sleep for me probably the

721
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:47,149
word baseline was mentioned here several

722
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:48,710
times or some sort of like default and I

723
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,980
think it's really important if you want

724
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:58,760
to start with biohacking trying things

725
00:42:51,980 --> 00:43:01,099
to to find your stable baseline if you

726
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,890
are having problems with you know

727
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:05,990
shifting changing changes in your

728
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:09,049
attention changes in your energy changes

729
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:14,058
in your mood throughout the days weeks

730
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:16,990
months years then it's probably best to

731
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:21,950
focus on stabilizing that first before

732
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:27,979
you know like trying to get strong or

733
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:30,980
trying to be super focused for the

734
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:36,490
purpose of working on something and then

735
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:39,200
burning out from it we have a question

736
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:42,558
so you mentioned that the sleep is very

737
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,180
important and the question is how do you

738
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,130
measure it how do you measure the

739
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:54,348
quality of sleep and what kind of tools

740
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:56,410
would you recommend okay probably on you

741
00:43:54,349 --> 00:44:01,630
for nikah okay

742
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:06,549
so I measure sleep currently with this

743
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:11,750
do you know it that's a order ring and

744
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:14,299
it has three sensors so it basically

745
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:19,039
measures you 24/7 it measures your

746
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:21,200
temperature and your HIV and basically

747
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,270
you wake up in the morning and what I do

748
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,890
is not to be dependent on the technology

749
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:31,160
I ask myself how how do I feel like do I

750
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,839
feel that I slept enough or not then I

751
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,259
answer myself and then I look at the

752
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:38,180
graph

753
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:40,340
and I can see how long I was in a REM

754
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:43,250
sleep that is very very important for us

755
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:46,070
how long I was in a deep sleep that is

756
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:48,140
also very very important for us and how

757
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:51,590
long I was in a light sleep that it's

758
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:54,200
not so important so when I do some

759
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:57,740
experiments I can see that for example

760
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:01,100
my light sleep decreased and my deep

761
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:03,919
sleep increased so you know this is for

762
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:07,700
example one one way how you can measure

763
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:12,590
that they are also probably more

764
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:15,439
accurate gadgets than Ora Inc one of

765
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:18,320
them is dream which is something that

766
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,690
you put on your on your on your head and

767
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:24,830
you go to sleep that is not really for

768
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:28,070
me but it has also a eg in it so it

769
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:30,740
measures some other different factors so

770
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:34,040
it depends what you wanna measure but

771
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:37,700
for myself this is the the best way now

772
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:41,330
because I can you know it's very nice

773
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,040
it's nice actually you know it's you

774
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:48,819
don't really know about it it's a ring

775
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:54,580
and I mean it measures some very basic

776
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:57,260
basic markers that you can use for

777
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:59,810
seeing like if your experiments are good

778
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:03,230
or not but I wouldn't be dependent on it

779
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:05,960
100% because your subjective feeling is

780
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:07,610
very important too so what I do is I

781
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,140
have a notebook and I write it down and

782
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:14,330
then I can see like what do I feel and

783
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:16,120
what it shows me if that answered your

784
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:19,340
question

785
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:22,400
Mirek you mentioned being metabolically

786
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:24,710
flexible yet would you say that you

787
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,900
reach that state sorry one spark would

788
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,390
you say that you reach that state that

789
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,250
you are mad about a blank you are trying

790
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:34,069
okay because my question was gonna be

791
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:36,290
how long did it take from being fat

792
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:41,450
adopted and running on fat versus sugar

793
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:43,820
to getting to the flexibility and if if

794
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:46,430
you have sugar or some carbs while you

795
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,119
are fat adapted do you get like or most

796
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:49,430
of the neck

797
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,849
side effects cut off or what's this

798
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:55,430
flexibility like yeah so the first part

799
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:58,700
I think you are talking about time so

800
00:46:55,430 --> 00:47:04,669
for example I'm trying it five years

801
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:08,089
maybe so we are talking about the Pareto

802
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:12,529
principle yeah I eat carbs definitely

803
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:18,078
maybe 20% around what 80 percent I'm a

804
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:21,980
fuel for fat and for proteins and if I

805
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:26,420
if I take some statistics about for

806
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:29,440
example Western medicine from USA one

807
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:34,339
percent of your you right how it's a

808
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:39,019
bulky sauce yeah you change one one

809
00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:44,660
percent of cells every day so to the

810
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:49,129
transform your lifestyle you you cancel

811
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:51,618
three mounds old habit and you build new

812
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:54,079
one of three mounds so together

813
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:57,200
it will be around six months but it must

814
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:00,799
be definitely a really hard working

815
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:05,058
commitment personal commitment so but

816
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:09,890
it's not matter accommodation I think if

817
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:13,759
we want a real a change in our life we

818
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:17,930
must atomic atomic steps a 10 a 10 a

819
00:48:13,759 --> 00:48:20,930
habits only one person one day so we're

820
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:23,450
talking about the mounds maybe six

821
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:27,499
months maybe one year but I guarantee

822
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:32,989
you are more freedom lay not only

823
00:48:27,499 --> 00:48:38,598
addictive or sugars and carbs I would

824
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:41,619
also add that you can actually measure

825
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:45,680
metabolic flexibility in many ways and

826
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:49,609
one of the ways is just don't eat for

827
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:53,180
two days and you can feel the difference

828
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:57,078
if you're not adapted to fat that this

829
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:58,910
will be very difficult and you will you

830
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:00,410
will see it but also by doing that you

831
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:04,180
are improving

832
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:07,520
the other way is using spirometry or

833
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:09,140
some ketone test spirometry is low

834
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,790
dependent so that

835
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,670
so you're basically breathing into a

836
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:16,910
machine and you're running on the bike

837
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:23,119
or on a on a treadmill with increasing

838
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:25,598
load and by the by the ratio of oxygen

839
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,599
and co2

840
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:32,950
the machine can measure if you are

841
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:37,399
burning or fermenting so so it will

842
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:42,560
basically show you a graph if you are

843
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:46,130
burning at the carbs or fats and under

844
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:49,820
which load so at some point even if

845
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:53,000
you're well adapted you cannot burn more

846
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:55,750
fat because you cannot breathe enough

847
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:00,890
oxygen and then you need to switch to

848
00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:02,810
fermenting carbohydrates but when you

849
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:04,640
see this graph this is something that

850
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:07,670
you can improve so you can do it once

851
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,819
then you do experiments train and and

852
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:13,550
you can do it in a half year or year and

853
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:17,570
see actually the the improvement that is

854
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:20,869
again dependent on on the load so so I

855
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:22,730
don't think that there is a universal

856
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:24,800
answer for some people it is very

857
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:26,780
natural for some people it takes a

858
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,609
longer time but you can see the progress

859
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:33,920
and you can see if you're actually

860
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:35,049
getting anywhere so that's just one more

861
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,570
thing

862
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:45,070
just simple a teeny rule how you think

863
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:49,580
how you feel after the whatever meal

864
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:51,760
it's for everybody we can measure HRV

865
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:57,770
you can measure everything

866
00:50:51,760 --> 00:51:00,109
heart rates brain waves the glucose so

867
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:03,700
what I think it's a western-style it's a

868
00:51:00,109 --> 00:51:10,520
it's a hard bio it's hard gadgets and

869
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:13,520
ancient wisdom how we feel if I take 300

870
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:16,430
grams of pasta Hawaii I

871
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:26,030
brain folk and I'm lazy do you want lazy

872
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:30,080
I don't know what easy hi my name is I'm

873
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:34,130
here my name is Andrew Durham I'm from

874
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:38,150
the US and I came to Czech Republic for

875
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:40,970
3 reasons I well I wanted to ask you

876
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:47,180
quickly first have you all done darkroom

877
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:48,919
retreats if you haven't have you good

878
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:54,410
therapy yep

879
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:56,630
ok yeah I wrote a book about this after

880
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:58,790
working with it for 10 years and I came

881
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:00,980
to Czech Republic because it is the

882
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:03,230
world capital of darkroom retreating

883
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:07,010
there's more going on here than anywhere

884
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:12,770
else in the world by far and I came to

885
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:15,350
do a retreat and also to find out why so

886
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:19,390
much stuff is going on here with

887
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:22,310
darkroom retreating so since that's like

888
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:24,500
one of my top 3 reasons for being in

889
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:28,549
this country I thought it would ask you

890
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:31,190
folks so what is the question why do you

891
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:33,410
think so much this is very specific of

892
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:36,080
course I I appreciate any other things

893
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:38,629
you've talked about but um why do you

894
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:42,770
think so much is going on with darkroom

895
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:44,930
or treating in your country it's

896
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:48,080
interesting I didn't know that we are

897
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:50,960
actually only number one you did yeah

898
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:54,560
maybe I have all I have for today

899
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:58,430
Czech Republic in 60 stay they were

900
00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:02,210
really big how it said in English this

901
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:06,440
nice love growth so you know holotropic

902
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:11,000
breathwork exactly and it starts very

903
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:14,500
big psycho tests in 60s in the army and

904
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,530
so many people and as a matter as a

905
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:21,590
scientist preparing some tests in in

906
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:26,390
psychology and combinative psych with

907
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:27,460
physics so maybe from the 60s if we

908
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:32,240
imagine for example

909
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:34,910
in the in the sports with the doping so

910
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:41,140
I think we have a strong chemical

911
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:45,379
background in in Czech 50 60 years ago

912
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:50,799
it's I think it might has a little bit

913
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:50,800
to do with the fact that people in here

914
00:53:51,220 --> 00:54:02,209
we have a history of we have a history

915
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:05,330
of spending a lot of time in nature or

916
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:09,110
generally people going into nature for

917
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:14,240
hikes as well as like having the history

918
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:17,840
of quote unquote natural medicine or you

919
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:20,479
know like the old grannies that use

920
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:25,340
warriors harps at cetera to to treat

921
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:27,590
illnesses at home and maybe this is

922
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:30,050
somehow affecting it for example you

923
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:35,600
said that we are like the capital of the

924
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:41,000
world for this we here are wearing the

925
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:42,170
vivo barefoot shoes and for example vivo

926
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,340
barefoot shoes

927
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:49,250
like they sell half of their production

928
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:51,310
probably in Czech Republic as well so

929
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:54,850
that's like another trend that is

930
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:58,370
completely out of proportion in here

931
00:54:54,850 --> 00:55:02,839
then in another countries similarly

932
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:05,089
people varying outdoor clothes in the

933
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,430
cities that's something like that's not

934
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:10,580
generally happening in other major

935
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:14,450
cities around in other countries but in

936
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:18,250
here it's somehow normal so I think

937
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:22,609
there is some sort of history of people

938
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:25,790
having close relationships with with

939
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:29,050
tourism and living spending weekends in

940
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:32,690
cottages and nature this sort of thing

941
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:40,730
okay before thank you before we take

942
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:43,099
another question well

943
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:48,920
I don't know actually I don't know why

944
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:50,900
Czech Republic is number one in this but

945
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,170
it's definitely interesting phenomena so

946
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:56,720
thank you for this information I think

947
00:55:54,170 --> 00:56:00,109
that you know a lot of people we we live

948
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,910
in a fast growing world but I would say

949
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:04,098
that that is everywhere that it's not

950
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:07,578
only here in the Czech Republic so I

951
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:09,260
don't know that I will think about it

952
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:13,970
thinks it's something to think about

953
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:16,040
yeah so some of you are living so that's

954
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:18,950
what I wanted to say if you want to see

955
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:22,190
another talk feel free to leave but

956
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:24,410
because there is nothing in this room

957
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:26,809
after this talk if you want to stay and

958
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:31,759
continue with discussion we are still

959
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:36,109
here so I'll just you know entertain you

960
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:41,540
for a few seconds until until we

961
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:43,670
continue so but it's your choice yes we

962
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:47,000
could do some breathing technique

963
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:47,720
you know completing technique yeah you

964
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,450
know my colleague

965
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,640
sadly my colleague Lieber he actually

966
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:54,740
invented few days ago very very

967
00:56:52,640 --> 00:57:00,348
interesting technique you would love it

968
00:56:54,740 --> 00:57:03,410
it's like yeah you feel like on LSD a

969
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:06,260
little bit like it's really interesting

970
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:08,089
and it's like a shortcut like you have

971
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,549
the move method and then you have this

972
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:13,369
and it's like a shortcut to you will see

973
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:21,609
I will show you it's great I've just

974
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:21,609
grows the silja

975
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:35,680
you
