[Music]

3
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:33,329
so hello everybody we are back on our

4
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:37,470
second stage slide Varna with hecka

5
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:41,730
Congress parallel me police 2019 welcome

6
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:43,290
for newcomers and Mahalo for those who

7
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,019
stayed with us after the max

8
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:51,120
presentation and right now we are

9
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:54,329
heading to a different topic it's my

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,890
pleasure to welcome on stage patella

11
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:03,119
patch so we have here a representation

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:07,110
of Czech academic research specifically

13
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:09,750
sociology because better obtain doctoral

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,720
degree in sociology from the Faculty of

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,979
art Charles University where he is right

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,579
now also teaching he also did research

17
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,429
or participated in research programs in

18
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,639
Kansas State University and New York

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,710
University but what is most important

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,069
about about him his external content out

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:36,119
of the check strategy for digital

22
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:39,479
literacy and what will he also talk

23
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:43,079
about today is his book beyond the

24
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:47,039
digital divide contextualize the

25
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,339
information society so better and his

26
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:51,649
talk constructing parallel opt-out

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,909
infrastructures a sociological

28
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:57,590
contribution is ready

29
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,590
so Peter floor is yours

30
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,250
one two three okay can you hear me well

31
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:10,160
great so it's a great pleasure to be

32
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,880
here and thank you very much for coming

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,880
for me being here is a big challenge

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,910
because I'm not specialist in the topics

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,750
that this Congress trying to cover

36
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:28,750
however what I as a sociologist am

37
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:32,000
interested in is the way the society

38
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:36,350
pertains its shape and social

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,730
reproduction and also what are the ways

40
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:43,180
we can positively change the society and

41
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:47,060
one of the ways that I was dealing with

42
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:52,730
in my past I mean in my academic past

43
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:56,060
was looking at one of the most impactful

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,819
attempt of trying to create parallel

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,799
network infrastructure to change the

46
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:09,380
world which is now known under the

47
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:13,329
umbrella term internet also I have been

48
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:16,940
recently focused on the topic of

49
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:22,989
inequalities caused by in equal access

50
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:25,970
to information technologies and somehow

51
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:30,290
before coming here I realized that these

52
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:32,570
two topics can be linked together and we

53
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,230
can maybe infer something interesting

54
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,810
from it for both your practice or for

55
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,660
general understanding of the things that

56
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:46,250
you're thinking about when visiting this

57
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:50,209
this conference starting with an article

58
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:57,970
that appeared a month ago about New York

59
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:57,970
and New Jersey lawyers thinking about

60
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:05,530
suing companies that allow only cashless

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:10,099
payments because they discriminate

62
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:12,680
against those who don't pay cash and I

63
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,030
was thinking whether these various

64
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,700
opt-out technology

65
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,380
that you are discussing here are

66
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,839
technologies that should serve only

67
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,510
individual purpose for people who are

68
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,130
wealthy from rich countries from higher

69
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,280
strata of society who were

70
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,870
technologically skilled or whether you

71
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,270
have something broader in aim I mean

72
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,810
changing society changing the world and

73
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:39,680
I bet the second the letter and if it's

74
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,440
the first I'm not interested so my

75
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,260
presentation has two parts in the first

76
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,300
part I would introduce you a very

77
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,300
interesting branch of sociological

78
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,750
thought which is named Science and

79
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:57,140
Technology studies or our sociology of

80
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:00,200
technology but this will not be like

81
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:04,150
academic long lecture describing authors

82
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:07,760
and so I would like to focus on two key

83
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:11,239
aspects or innovations in this field

84
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,789
that we can use to understand better how

85
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,020
to opt out technologically very better

86
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:21,110
it is possible and what should we be

87
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,260
aware of in the second part I will try

88
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:27,260
to interconnect this first part with my

89
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,690
recent research on the so called digital

90
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,270
divide which is the state of people

91
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:36,530
having different level of participation

92
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:42,200
on society because of unequal access to

93
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:44,599
information technologies so normally in

94
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,500
society and especially in hacker

95
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,539
community there is prevalent

96
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,950
understanding of a specific relationship

97
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:58,330
between the technical and the social and

98
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:02,690
the true lationship is a relationship of

99
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:07,849
you know linear direct impact of

100
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:09,740
technology on on social so when I went

101
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,650
through some historical texts of hackers

102
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,990
from 80s and 90s and also when I'm

103
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:19,370
reading statements around annotations of

104
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:22,400
some presentations that are here I can

105
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:26,210
clearly see the idea of trying to solve

106
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,620
social problems or to escape social

107
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,229
reality or to build

108
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,389
parallel infrastructures by purely

109
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,870
technological means this is something

110
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:38,090
that is very common and it's typical for

111
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:41,240
Western thinking and for our broad

112
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:45,619
understanding of how the world functions

113
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,449
and how the society functions and it is

114
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,120
embodied in the classical models of

115
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,790
linear technological research that we

116
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,460
have scientists they produce truth then

117
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:59,360
we have engineers they applicate these

118
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,830
truths into technological innovations

119
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:07,010
then we have economical markets that

120
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:12,280
diffuse these innovations to populations

121
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:16,250
and then comes the impact however the

122
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:19,030
sociology of Technology shows completely

123
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,820
different picture which is based on

124
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:25,820
analysis of past innovations and how

125
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,820
they were developed and how the impact

126
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,550
developed during the phases of the

127
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,159
innovation development and there are two

128
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,840
key lessons that we could learn that I

129
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,539
would like to start with and the first

130
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,700
lesson is that the social and technical

131
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:46,550
are intertwined they never can have or

132
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,490
work with something that is purely

133
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:53,690
technological or purely social or

134
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:56,660
psychological we we as persons are

135
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:59,870
functions of things and other people

136
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:03,680
that we are surrounded that we surround

137
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:07,699
ourselves actively and the things that

138
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,419
we construct our functioning because we

139
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:16,190
embed certain images of their users into

140
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:19,760
their design so and users also means

141
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,219
society so if you for example want to

142
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:28,360
program a new software or to come with

143
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:31,849
with a new material artifact and you

144
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,849
construct it with the wrong idea of what

145
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:37,189
people want how do they see it what do

146
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,959
they need so this will not be accepted

147
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,040
and this will not be diffused and it

148
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:47,550
will end in the pitfall of

149
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:53,010
history the the second important point

150
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:57,170
is that because of that our technologies

151
00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:00,930
are mirroring our societies our

152
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,729
technologies are not given and they are

153
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,989
not the only one that we could have and

154
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:09,620
there are specific outcome of specific

155
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:13,070
interactions between technical and

156
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:16,860
social and I am still very much a

157
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:19,020
general and I will try to show it on the

158
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,470
example of Internet development at least

159
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:25,560
clearly in basic outlines my favorite

160
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:29,700
sentence from one of the best books

161
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,609
about the topic is that the technologies

162
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,640
that we have that form infrastructure of

163
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:40,500
our everyday lives might be otherwise it

164
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:44,430
just depends on who when got power and

165
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,250
resources to invent certain certainly

166
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,589
designed technologies for example they

167
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,380
could have so called ecological

168
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,450
technologies who have now this wave of

169
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,880
ecological innovations this could have

170
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,400
been 50 years ago if someone wanted but

171
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,290
there was clearly no interest and no

172
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,050
such meaning attributed to innovation

173
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:10,189
then even if there were these problems

174
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:15,870
that you could still clearly see so one

175
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:17,490
of the more famous branches of the

176
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,070
sociology of technology is the so called

177
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,590
social construction of technology and I

178
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:25,890
mentioned it only because it came with

179
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:30,440
interesting finding that historical

180
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:33,660
textbooks are artificially linearizing

181
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,310
the innovations of the past but there

182
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,100
are many innovations that are hidden

183
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:43,170
that were forgotten and that could also

184
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:47,100
be successful if the things went in a in

185
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:51,209
other way and usually or in many cases

186
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,670
this is just a coincidence or or the

187
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,360
case of probability that we are now in

188
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,110
the world

189
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:02,689
that we are and backwardly then we are

190
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:05,369
reconstructing this linear linear

191
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:12,569
technologies there is an important

192
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:14,910
question whether the forecasts that went

193
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:17,368
wrong we're only forecasts that were

194
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,009
wrong at the time there was said I I

195
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:22,949
choose several famous forecasts linked

196
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:26,610
to a computer technology and some of

197
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:30,149
them were right in the moment they were

198
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:33,480
said and their authors couldn't

199
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:36,889
anticipate in in what direction these

200
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:40,889
technologies will develop for example

201
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:42,989
there is the famous quote from 1977 from

202
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:46,139
the CEO and founder of Digital Equipment

203
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:48,389
Corporation that there is no reason for

204
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:52,259
any individual to have a computer in his

205
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:54,569
home and it is shown how how false and

206
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,489
naive he was that he couldn't see it but

207
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:59,819
the problem is that at the time you had

208
00:11:56,489 --> 00:12:03,749
the term computer meant more things that

209
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:07,019
nowadays and one of the meanings of the

210
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:09,600
term was a big framework which was

211
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:13,769
linked to households why are why are

212
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,749
consoles and it was anticipated that the

213
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:18,149
appliances in the household will be also

214
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:20,730
linked to these consoles and will be so

215
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,379
how managed from the center so when he

216
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:26,069
was talking about the computer he was

217
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:28,739
talking about one current of development

218
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:31,549
that didn't prove to be successful and

219
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:33,989
that was current of having big

220
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:38,579
computational machines in the center and

221
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:41,720
and and linked by consoles with

222
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:46,859
households and the personal computer one

223
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:51,290
this historical moment so at every stage

224
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:55,230
of innovation development there is

225
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,910
usually more groups or more people

226
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,399
involved in its development that

227
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,100
attribute different meaning to the

228
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:06,000
innovation and based on their

229
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:10,040
interactions the meanings win the

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,320
there are very interesting for example a

231
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:17,040
very interesting example of bicycle

232
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,160
development when the internet originated

233
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,410
there were four basic groups each each

234
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,900
one of which contributed different

235
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,209
meanings to the technology and that the

236
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:31,560
group of computer scientists that saw it

237
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:34,230
as leverage for societal revolution

238
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,630
proved to be successful because they

239
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,300
were able to translate what they were

240
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,890
working on to the language of army

241
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,290
officials so they couldn't provide them

242
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:47,370
with resources and they could also

243
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:49,589
resist some centralizing tendencies from

244
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:57,930
so-called MP guys were guys from

245
00:13:49,590 --> 00:14:00,690
electricity industry who who wanted to

246
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:04,319
have a certain try system with service

247
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,450
high feedback so another branch is

248
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:11,430
Action Network theory which works with

249
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:14,820
an idea that for an innovation to be

250
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,819
functional you have to have a stable set

251
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:21,030
of actors which for for the first time

252
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,750
comes in mind of innovators and then

253
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:29,910
they try to implement it in reality and

254
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:33,480
if that network how the innovation will

255
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:37,439
be linked to other parts of elements or

256
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,680
reality is well defined then the

257
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,740
innovation is successful in reality and

258
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,370
the classic example is an example of

259
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:50,460
comparison of Thomas Alva Edison who was

260
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:54,870
very successful in designing persuading

261
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:57,150
politics and managing quite a big

262
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,630
organization of people who were working

263
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:03,270
on his behalf and then taken into

264
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:08,700
consideration at the way the his

265
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:10,760
innovations could be replicated which

266
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,960
was not so strong cased with for example

267
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:17,360
Nikola Tesla and it was very interesting

268
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:23,030
point in their in their battle

269
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:26,370
so meanwhile after the Second World War

270
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:28,589
for the sociology of technology develops

271
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,800
in 80s and 90s and after the Second

272
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,840
World War a very interesting shift is

273
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,390
happening and it's a shift in the

274
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,040
meaning attributed to a computer

275
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,980
technology because until the Second

276
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,260
World War it was understood solely as a

277
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:48,300
calculator as something that has to

278
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:51,750
calcul and to compute but the idea that

279
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:56,160
computer could communicate either with

280
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:58,290
its user or that it could serve as a

281
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,180
medium for communication among people

282
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:05,939
it was completely strange and it was one

283
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:08,819
of the very influential ideas that one

284
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,550
of the main persons from the beginning

285
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,900
of computer networking Licklider came

286
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:19,410
with and it became very influential in

287
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:22,970
computer scientific community for that

288
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:25,319
community to be emotionally and

289
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:30,030
professionally involved in the

290
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,710
development of computer network the the

291
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:41,670
broader meaning of what they were doing

292
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:43,380
and also sorry the broader meaning of

293
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,140
what they were doing was what's needed

294
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,030
and one of the tags that served as a

295
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,780
starting point that was very influential

296
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:54,380
across next at least 30 years was a text

297
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:58,680
computer as a communication device

298
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:00,900
written in 1968 it was four years before

299
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,409
first functional presentation of

300
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:08,040
computer networking technology and in

301
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:12,990
that text the authors are promising a

302
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:17,730
new technology that is feasible and that

303
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:20,880
can cause societal revolution that it

304
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:24,089
will make people happier it will be more

305
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,630
effective and productive for people to

306
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:30,149
communicate in that text we can see

307
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,010
passages about that

308
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,220
there is plenty of opportunities

309
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:38,690
awaiting for for everyone to work

310
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,400
because there is endless frontier of

311
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:45,480
this computer networking technology to

312
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,250
discover so they were expecting

313
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,470
fostering cooperation and promote

314
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,020
coherence online interactive communities

315
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,230
of interest and disappearance of

316
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,420
unemployment and if everything gets well

317
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:59,460
the only problem could be if there is an

318
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,370
obstacle in diffusing these technologies

319
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:09,080
towards a whole whole population to all

320
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:12,540
people if we would look in detail on

321
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,429
construction of computer networking

322
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,970
technologies we could clearly see that

323
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:21,000
this expectation and Prevention of

324
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:24,060
centralizing the system one was one of

325
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,400
the main motives behind its behind its

326
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:31,470
its development in the in the 70s the

327
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,220
communities of users were developing the

328
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:37,320
system started to understand the

329
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:42,120
computer networks as a technology of

330
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:45,000
liberation they started to appear a

331
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:49,020
community feeling of people who were

332
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:54,300
using this technology and in the in the

333
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:55,110
80s then started the concept of

334
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,510
cyberspace

335
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:01,229
of open sea that you could enter and

336
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:04,800
that you can use to to avoid the society

337
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:08,730
and at the time the main enemies for for

338
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:12,750
another development positive development

339
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:16,590
of the technology was was defined as the

340
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:20,580
state and the corporation among hacker

341
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:22,980
hacker communities also and in this time

342
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,389
the technology that was based on

343
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:30,620
horizontal networking was successful on

344
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:33,920
establishing new communicating

345
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,719
communities based on a shared interest

346
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,030
that very very supportive and that

347
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,730
fulfilled at this part of promise that

348
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:45,750
was in these original text and this with

349
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:50,440
with all that until the beginning of the

350
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:53,530
90s the problem was that the engineers

351
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:57,070
believed that the positive impact of

352
00:19:53,530 --> 00:20:00,310
computer networking can be fulfilled

353
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:03,189
solely by the good design and for them

354
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:06,250
it meant a reduction to networking

355
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,730
protocols so they got rid of a

356
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:13,240
development of another layers and

357
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:14,820
software and so on and try to diffuse to

358
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,990
speed up the diffusion of this

359
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:27,760
purportedly positive technology why our

360
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:31,000
market and by a free market so and in

361
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,300
parallel in 80's there has been

362
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,160
happening a huge investment in the

363
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,840
development of these technologies from

364
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,870
the private hands and from private

365
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,300
actors that went to formation of

366
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:47,350
privatized faribault corporate networks

367
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:51,430
that at the end of 90s consisted based

368
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:54,459
on estimation two-thirds of all computer

369
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:56,470
networks traffic and also they start to

370
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,570
emerge intermediaries to sort choose

371
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,940
evaluate information nowadays search

372
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,830
engines and they're also started

373
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,550
commercializing of excess so that you

374
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:09,070
have several companies or actors that

375
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:12,639
provide access to majority of population

376
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:18,419
and can serve as a control point for for

377
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:20,380
the Internet traffic in the 90s these

378
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,110
positive changes that were already

379
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,330
stabilized in certain set of

380
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:27,820
relationship between them technology and

381
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:32,580
people that were using that starting

382
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,580
partially to crumble due to huge

383
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:38,770
increase in the population of users

384
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,930
because the virtual communities of the

385
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,780
time weren't able to socialize the

386
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,490
newcomers to netiquette to their worlds

387
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:50,230
of behavior how to communicate

388
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:52,000
effectively and these these virtual

389
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,410
communities in a traditional sense of

390
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,070
meaning became limited to the

391
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:02,480
few people another another problem or we

392
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,990
can call it problem from the perspective

393
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,680
of the original promise if we can call

394
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:14,360
so was that there was a huge investment

395
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:25,750
from commercial sphere since the half of

396
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:27,860
80s which went to which went to

397
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:31,070
appropriation of the technology by

398
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,919
financial markets corporations and

399
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,480
multimedia business and in interaction

400
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,670
with users and with other actors

401
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,040
involved in development of this

402
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,470
technology they created so complex

403
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,360
system that we are facing nowadays but

404
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,550
that is far from away the original

405
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,919
promise I don't want to say that the

406
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:53,600
original promise was feasible but that

407
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:55,220
there were many that was a certain

408
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:00,199
potential in developing this technology

409
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:04,370
that was fulfilled due to their ability

410
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,230
to control the development of the system

411
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,739
for quite a long time it was like 15

412
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:15,100
years suppose a little to 15 years and

413
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:17,840
an even longer in certain aspect and and

414
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:23,149
but but what went wrong called the

415
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:26,899
problem was that they believed that when

416
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:29,870
they design technological aid so they do

417
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,930
not need to take care of other actors of

418
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:35,379
other relationships like states

419
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:40,190
corporations that definitely started to

420
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:46,850
intervene with visit echnology so the

421
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:53,260
lesson is quite quite general and it can

422
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:58,189
be summed up as taking care of relations

423
00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:00,740
towards the innovation that can be

424
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,840
defining for its design developments

425
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,750
that can intervene with the original

426
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,300
design that the author's had in that in

427
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,820
mind in my annotation

428
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,340
had a question whether famous John Perry

429
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:17,689
Barlow Declaration of Independence was

430
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:20,929
too early too late or just in time at

431
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:24,380
the time it was written and published it

432
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:26,870
was it was according to me and what I

433
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,910
told you too late for that because it is

434
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:32,179
not true that the governments and

435
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:34,280
corporations have not engaged in that

436
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:39,710
great and gathering conversation in it

437
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:43,970
not true that the cyberspace was the

438
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:49,180
home only of the people who have nothing

439
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:56,540
to do with Internet and commerce and

440
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:59,720
corporations and state so let's go to a

441
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:04,550
second phase of presentation and it's a

442
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,810
presentation the part till in quiz so

443
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,980
call digital divide these are

444
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:12,440
inequalities and Internet access and

445
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:16,940
there is among government's and

446
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:20,030
researchers is quite popular the model

447
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,880
which can be visualized like that that

448
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:25,700
in society you have certain inequalities

449
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,360
that lead to unequal access to these new

450
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,160
technologies the street again to unequal

451
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,229
distribution of benefits from using

452
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,780
these technologies and then it

453
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,910
perpetuates social inequality stemming

454
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,600
from using the technologies so we have

455
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:45,230
something like a spiral of inequality

456
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,850
linked to Internet adoption because

457
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:49,460
people have different level of skills

458
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:54,949
and different quality of equipment and

459
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:58,250
so on the question is and the question

460
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:01,610
was not answered surprisingly for me

461
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:04,850
until recently whether it is true that

462
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:06,590
it is versi to spread internet among all

463
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,199
the people whether it is really

464
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:12,040
something that was in the promise that

465
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,500
it will make people's life happier and

466
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:18,129
if that's really true that people who

467
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,600
are outside of this network are

468
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:24,790
disadvantaged and we asked

469
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,100
a question in a representative study

470
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:30,250
here in Czech Republic and ice was done

471
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:34,449
similarly also abroad that people has to

472
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:35,740
evaluate how internet people users of

473
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,430
the internet had to evaluate how

474
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:43,800
Internet has affected their life based

475
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:48,130
on their experience in last year's and

476
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:50,620
we had this question for different parts

477
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:54,400
of life like knowledge around vodka and

478
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:57,280
Czech Republic in the world how it

479
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,590
affected local involvement how it

480
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,180
affected family relationships contact

481
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:04,169
with friends their finance situation

482
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:07,120
career hobbies and overall satisfaction

483
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:12,000
with life and in blue colors are

484
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:15,459
positive answers so this is definitely

485
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,860
affirmation that people see the Internet

486
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,020
as contributing and positive force in

487
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,689
their life the least so in local

488
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,600
involvement and financial situation but

489
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:28,180
very heavily in the way people feel

490
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,879
informed this is very interesting in

491
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:34,060
comparison with current praxis or with

492
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,880
current state of having so much

493
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,010
disinformation and people believing in

494
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,990
complete nonsense or people that are

495
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:45,550
clearly not true but majority of people

496
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:47,590
think that they are better informed

497
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:55,510
because they have this technology at

498
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:58,570
their disposal still there are more and

499
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:03,360
more concrete stories about people who

500
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:06,909
can be disadvantaged by not being

501
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,100
connected and one of the special most

502
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:11,620
remarkable cases are people from poor

503
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:16,830
families among teenagers or among school

504
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:19,929
children who heavily used infrastructure

505
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,639
the Internet and all this application as

506
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:23,440
infrastructure for this social life for

507
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,690
communication so when you're not using

508
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,410
this infrastructure it seems that you

509
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:31,300
are left out disconnected and and out of

510
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,250
social context you don't know what's

511
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,330
going on and you don't have resources

512
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:40,519
friends and so on so we also asked

513
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:43,199
users whether they felt disadvantaged

514
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:46,049
whether they experienced disadvantage

515
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:51,029
because of the fact that they are not

516
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:54,090
using the internet and the answers were

517
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:56,669
quite surprising from the position of

518
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:59,158
State Information policies and

519
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:02,279
researchers who claim that it's quite

520
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:05,700
bad today not to be connected because

521
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:08,549
majority of people saw who were non

522
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:13,980
users like 20% of population two-thirds

523
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:16,940
of them were seniors and other trades

524
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:20,820
were for example less educated people

525
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,769
with lower income so they declared that

526
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,189
they see no change and then they didn't

527
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:29,460
fell disadvantaged so and how can we

528
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:32,929
combine it together because in the

529
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,679
current understanding of having

530
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:38,070
infrastructure like network

531
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,990
infrastructure that brings good it is

532
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,389
only logical that people who are not

533
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,940
involved in this infrastructure will be

534
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:47,879
disadvantaged so this is quite difficult

535
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:52,279
to explain it so I try to come up with a

536
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:56,210
new model or new approach that I titled

537
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:59,070
contextual that can explain it and as a

538
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:03,240
by-product of that model there is an

539
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:06,450
interesting finding about how the

540
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,120
parallel new network infrastructure

541
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,250
interacts with the old interest not

542
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,789
working to a structure to create new

543
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:18,690
dependencies so when we are talking

544
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:21,720
about dependency so on from the point of

545
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:26,340
view of sociology of technology you are

546
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:29,070
becoming dependent on technology once

547
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,590
you integrate it into your everyday

548
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:34,740
routine because you will then miss your

549
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:38,600
technology like you can always leave it

550
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:41,669
aside or give up using the technology

551
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,529
but only on under certain conditions and

552
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:47,309
the question is what are these

553
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:50,100
conditions if there are people there are

554
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:52,350
people who clearly cannot

555
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,980
allowed themselves to be non-users or

556
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:58,980
weak users not be skilled because then

557
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:02,340
they would have really serious programs

558
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,640
in their work or everyday life for

559
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:09,540
example students or people from

560
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:12,840
occupations from who really need these

561
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:20,610
technologies for the normal work and so

562
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:22,530
we asked people how big share that if

563
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:25,080
they could estimate how big share of

564
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:28,800
their social environment the people they

565
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:32,310
are in contact with are actually using

566
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:35,250
the Internet and at the time it was 80

567
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:37,139
percent of population so you can

568
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:40,410
translate it to the person's if you

569
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:45,060
multiply it by 10 and you can clearly

570
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:51,360
see that among the older population and

571
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:54,179
among the less educated population the

572
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,459
people are less surrounded by another

573
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:59,330
people who are using this technology

574
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:02,820
because of that there is not so strong

575
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:05,449
networking effect caused by being

576
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:08,520
dependent on using this technology for

577
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:12,450
communication and for social for social

578
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:14,400
life very similar is when we ask how

579
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:18,780
important is the internet for work for

580
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:22,920
example i-10 is I couldn't do my job

581
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:26,070
without using the internet zero is my

582
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:28,890
job wouldn't be affected by not using

583
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,810
the engine for longer time and you could

584
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:35,280
again see that there is higher

585
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:39,840
dependency of people on on this

586
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,610
infrastructure among younger people and

587
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:48,510
people with higher education being in a

588
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:54,169
specific occupational job so ah the

589
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:54,170
lesson and my attempt to

590
00:32:54,230 --> 00:33:01,070
do a synthesis of these contradicting

591
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,080
findings is that you can actually

592
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,720
explain the level of disadvantage for

593
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:12,240
known users of a certain network

594
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:15,960
infrastructure by the embeddedness of a

595
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,870
given network in technology in a social

596
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,809
institution and in everyday life it is

597
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:24,149
the first vector second second factor is

598
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:27,080
availability of alternative information

599
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:34,289
or communication channels for example if

600
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:37,379
you want to contact some officials and

601
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:39,120
the only way to do it is by email so

602
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:43,039
then you are disadvantaged but not using

603
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:47,520
it but if sending them a letter is

604
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,890
comparably difficult or if they live in

605
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,700
house next to you so then it's not so

606
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:54,210
big problem

607
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,100
so the third factor is the factor of

608
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:58,649
differences in the cost outcome ratio

609
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:01,139
when compared to Internet use because in

610
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:04,260
certain activities it is clear that it's

611
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:07,289
more efficient to use the technology

612
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,480
that was made for that purpose then then

613
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:11,369
to use its alternatives but it is not

614
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,540
always so because you have you from so

615
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:16,710
parallel structures then it always

616
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:19,940
depend on the context so it was like

617
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:23,250
from the perspective of a single user

618
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:30,089
which can then feel to be forced to use

619
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:34,409
these technologies by by its environment

620
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:36,899
and surrounding the second factor the

621
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,730
second type of factor on the network

622
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:43,310
perspective is something that I call the

623
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:43,310
ratio of communication network size and

624
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,330
the factor is titled the flipside of

625
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:52,290
Metcalf's

626
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:55,399
I don't know if you aware of the classic

627
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:58,920
Metcalfe's law which tries to describe

628
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:01,290
the benefit from using network or being

629
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,119
member of a network as a square of

630
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:06,570
number of connected users of the system

631
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,810
and the mathematicians tonga and Wilson

632
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,990
in 2011

633
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:14,020
tried to model the relationship between

634
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:16,779
two networks when they develop next to

635
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:19,300
each other and they found out that one

636
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,670
wants a certain threshold which is

637
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,120
usually somewhere around 50% of

638
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:29,170
population using the network technology

639
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:32,799
crosses the threshold so then those who

640
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:35,620
are not in the network face the

641
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,040
increased increased costs that also

642
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:41,500
affect those who are Internet work the

643
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,720
example can be a cart transportation

644
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,560
network system and sidewall public

645
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:50,109
transport because the more people use

646
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,660
the car transportation like individual

647
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:55,030
system the less profitable is to use

648
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,000
public transport ultimate and transport

649
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:01,240
which leads to to break up of public

650
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,310
transport system and the sidewalk for

651
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,080
example disappear which is the case from

652
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,330
the history of the United States for

653
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,100
example and they apply this analysis

654
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,600
also to the health care system in the

655
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,190
United States which is more expensive

656
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:16,029
because treating people who are not

657
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:19,060
insured and for example it's interesting

658
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:21,180
case to apply it to to Eber and similar

659
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:25,480
taxi driving system or to broadband

660
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:28,299
internet then it leads actually to

661
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,990
paradox that the more certain network

662
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:33,760
technology becomes an exclusive

663
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:36,549
communication tool or information tool

664
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,650
for accessing something the more of a

665
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:42,280
disadvantage this poses for non users

666
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:44,290
and weak users so when we focus only on

667
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,150
creating technology without having in

668
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:48,940
mind something like upon point of

669
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:51,940
translation or alternative ways then we

670
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,940
can actually create the situation of

671
00:36:51,940 --> 00:37:00,280
disadvantaged by pushing people into

672
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:01,960
that system so that's everything that I

673
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,740
wanted to say and thank you for your

674
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,170
attention

675
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,330
I hope you could link the things that I

676
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,640
was saying it were mostly quite abstract

677
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:12,500
to something that interests you and that

678
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:22,040
you hurt or will hear in this conference

679
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:26,110
thank you for attention I would like to

680
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:29,420
thank Peter or Patera for bringing this

681
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:32,000
sociological point of view to the hacker

682
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:34,790
Congress and now I think we have a time

683
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,380
for a few questions so okay there is a

684
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:44,029
resident hello thanks for the

685
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:47,060
presentation at the point about as the

686
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:50,380
internet usage expanded the decline of

687
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:53,860
shared ideas and etiquette happen is

688
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:56,900
really struck me so I would like to ask

689
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:00,530
do we face something similar with

690
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:04,700
Bitcoin adoption the question is how can

691
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:07,840
we prevent cyberpunk ideas ideals and it

692
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:13,460
was from becoming diluted as Bitcoin

693
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:16,300
ever expands in user base yeah that this

694
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:20,600
an idea that I was also thinking about

695
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:22,580
because mostly when people are talking

696
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,210
about opt-out innovations here at this

697
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:28,779
conference they are thinking about

698
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:31,010
horizontal decentralized solutions and

699
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:34,670
in this horizontal decentralized

700
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:37,520
solutions it's it's a question how to

701
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:40,250
maintain the design of the whole

702
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,650
technological system because the

703
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,340
internet was decentralized technology at

704
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:46,340
least partly

705
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:49,100
but there were certain organizations

706
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:51,110
that had monopolies even professional

707
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,360
societies about defining for example

708
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:55,400
protocol unification standardization and

709
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,190
this kind of stuff and with

710
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,820
cryptocurrencies I think there is not

711
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:04,100
something like that so it leads me to a

712
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:07,700
conclusion that we cannot actually

713
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:11,740
prevent them from being corrupted unless

714
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:15,649
we come with an innovation that takes

715
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,279
more broader social context within so

716
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,230
you

717
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,630
will not stay limited only to the

718
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:24,140
problem of currency and how to generate

719
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:26,510
it and distribute it but we will also we

720
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:30,350
would have to also in invent social

721
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:33,290
institutions that take care of holding

722
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:41,210
it in shape if it's understandable yeah

723
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:43,930
thank you so for my size thanks for the

724
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,890
plantation you said that you are

725
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,290
basically you research based on the

726
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,810
assumption that the internet is only a

727
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:53,120
positive yeah so like you said it's like

728
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:55,700
a positive good and my question is and

729
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,410
how far it would impact your results if

730
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,470
one could also assume that internet

731
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:03,250
maybe has negative side effects and if

732
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:06,740
this would change the results yeah yeah

733
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:08,950
that's interesting question for me when

734
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:12,350
I started to do this kind of research it

735
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:14,870
kind of struck me that there are two

736
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,940
different research traditions and one is

737
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,930
dealing with the topic of digital divide

738
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:23,060
and in 100 percent of texts published

739
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:25,759
about this topic the researchers and

740
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:28,040
experts consultants and politicians

741
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,800
assume only positive effects and there

742
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:39,640
is another branch like a research in

743
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,640
addictive behavior or online crime and

744
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:45,740
surveillance online surveillance which

745
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:48,200
show the Internet in more negative way

746
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:51,399
and these true branches were not

747
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:54,290
connected until recently and for example

748
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,200
one of the benefits from combining these

749
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:59,720
two was when you apply it to effect on a

750
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,509
sociability on how what effect Internet

751
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:05,259
has on the way your social life look

752
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:07,730
like and then you find clear threshold

753
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,100
until which the Internet has positive

754
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:12,200
effects and once you exceed this

755
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:15,319
threshold of amount of time devoted to

756
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,970
use the technology so then the effect on

757
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,630
your social life becomes to be negative

758
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:22,899
so this is the answer you can fruitfully

759
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,900
applied

760
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:34,600
okay we have time for one more question

761
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:36,970
if there is an a okay maybe maybe I will

762
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,950
take this opportunity because what's on

763
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,899
my mind all the time and it may be very

764
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,419
simple question but I would like to ask

765
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:48,240
us you the audience but first level as

766
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:51,610
Cupid pattern should be internet

767
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,939
privilege or right what do you think

768
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:57,190
what's your opinion how my opinion is

769
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:00,070
also the conclusion of my book is that

770
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:03,310
it should be right but simultaneously

771
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:06,070
the government should take care of

772
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,509
people who do not want to use it for any

773
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:10,030
reason because it doesn't need to be

774
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:13,660
only that you are old but it can be also

775
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:15,190
for a specific I don't know values or

776
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,319
culture for example you are more like

777
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:19,780
nature man and you don't want to use it

778
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,530
for example and the society shouldn't

779
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:25,300
allow conditions under which you will be

780
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,980
disadvantaged but by not using one

781
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,200
infrastructure like communication

782
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,210
infrastructure so it should also develop

783
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,330
for example in Britain there was

784
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:37,930
interesting project of providing

785
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:40,390
assistance via phone calls I mean in

786
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:43,210
this state bureaucracy that allow to

787
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:45,490
bypass the need to use for example

788
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:48,840
online form for people who are old or

789
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:52,029
feel not skillful and then cannot use it

790
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:54,370
but my question to follow-up is just

791
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:56,350
that what we see annual also to mention

792
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:58,299
the situation is that more and more like

793
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:00,670
big players and bit private companies

794
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,230
are taking advantage of this of this

795
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,700
like distributed network and the

796
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:06,490
question is can you imagine that this

797
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:09,790
this right to the Internet would be

798
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:11,950
somehow secured by the institution which

799
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:14,320
are non-governmental is it possible to

800
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,990
stop private entities could like make

801
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,210
sure that we have and if do they would

802
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:22,899
do it it's possible that they wouldn't

803
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:27,490
use it just for like the profit purposes

804
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:31,000
I think it's too late and realizing it's

805
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:33,430
try it because there's so many interests

806
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,710
and types of organizational behavior is

807
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,180
embedded in internet design that you

808
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:40,210
just cannot go back

809
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:42,549
and the problem is that for example the

810
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:45,369
endeavor to to broaden internet

811
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:46,690
connection who doubt that and who did

812
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:49,030
that in the past is very mostly

813
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:51,579
companies who profit from having a

814
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:54,460
bigger market and they try to structure

815
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:55,809
or limit the ways you can exit the

816
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,660
internet through their websites for

817
00:43:55,809 --> 00:44:01,030
example Microsoft was very active in 90s

818
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,368
in providing for example internet access

819
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:06,069
the same with a wall in the United

820
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:09,579
States and the same is with Facebook and

821
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:11,619
Google attempt to cover the whole globe

822
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:13,599
with the Internet signal definitely

823
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:16,210
there are some like positive aspect what

824
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,880
is this mixed face a clearly profit that

825
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:21,099
they can see from that ok so I see here

826
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,640
a challenge for the blockchain maybe

827
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:28,210
technology and based technology or Dow -

828
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,770
maybe somehow you're like final

829
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:33,490
statement that it's too late somehow

830
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:35,410
like - for come but the question for you

831
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:39,339
now audience is like what do you think

832
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:41,649
the internet right or privilege so

833
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:43,509
please consider for yourself and I would

834
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,400
like to ask you like who would vote for

835
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:50,980
privilege that the Internet should be

836
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:55,000
privileged okay and who vote that it

837
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:57,460
should be right okay hopefully we are

838
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,020
right so thank you Peter
