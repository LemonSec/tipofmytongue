deep pleasure for me to welcome our last

6
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:47,089
speaker friend Shakur Frank Ravel he is

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:49,910
a CEO and co-founder of Symantec vision

8
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,820
what is check company which collects and

9
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:57,080
analyzes 90% of Virts

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:01,760
news content and he deeply understand

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:05,509
the media ecosystem and he will tell you

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:11,179
much more about what we should be ever

13
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,950
in nowadays word thank you thank you for

14
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:17,150
the introduction

15
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:19,400
[Applause]

16
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,780
it's a pleasure to be here and thank you

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,150
for the invitation

18
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:28,460
actually this is the first time I

19
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:30,890
present to the audience like yours and I

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:35,389
really appreciate it because I believe

21
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:40,429
that we should join forces today I would

22
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,820
like to share my views on the new type

23
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:47,079
of dictatorship I call the dictation

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:51,919
dictatorship 2.0 which is powered by

25
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:55,548
artificial intelligence and at the

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,280
beginning let me show you a short video

27
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:07,280
of hopefully some of you know it's a

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:12,050
Charlie Chaplin's parody of dictators it

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,210
was that the movie was released in 1940

30
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:18,590
and I think you perfectly understand

31
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:22,250
what is the parody about this or the old

32
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:28,990
dictators they try to rule the world

33
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:34,760
through force and it was basically 3d 3d

34
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:37,870
dictatorship firstly let me introduce my

35
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,870
company shortly

36
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:48,030
we-we-we are based or our system is

37
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:52,500
based on not only that we collect a data

38
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:55,950
in large scale let's say 3/2 times 10

39
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,290
times more than in Google News every as

40
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,670
so the number of sources that we work

41
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:07,700
with is over 650,000 our sources are

42
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:10,470
news websites online news portals blogs

43
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:15,328
different websites belonging to

44
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:21,180
government or academia or companies and

45
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:25,620
and so on and the system uses semantic

46
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:29,310
analysis as as the key method to

47
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:35,939
understand what the the articles the

48
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:40,040
documents are about since what we do for

49
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:45,948
living is not detecting this information

50
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:49,560
but is detecting unknown events that

51
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:52,709
that have the potential to jeopardize

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,750
the supply chain in some in some sort of

53
00:03:52,709 --> 00:04:01,229
in some shape and we keep I on millions

54
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:05,010
of companies that are suppliers of of

55
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:07,889
the big of the big buyers mainly they're

56
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:12,239
multinational large multi multinational

57
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:19,228
companies and working with such a amount

58
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:20,970
of data information sources we are one

59
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:25,650
of the very few organizations in the

60
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:29,610
world that that has an overview of the

61
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:33,120
entire media landscape and our

62
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,909
capabilities in detection of this

63
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,289
information is basically sight product

64
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:44,669
of what we do for living by the way

65
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:46,620
because most of you are IT experts the

66
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:49,469
biggest challenge that we face is to

67
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,790
distinguish the critical noise from the

68
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:55,550
critical signals

69
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:59,190
from irrelevant noise and to end

70
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,130
detecting unknown events is of course in

71
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:07,860
orders of magnitude more complex than

72
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:13,219
just provide search capability since we

73
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:18,090
are in Prague all of you know that

74
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:21,060
Czechoslovakia was occupied by by by

75
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:29,419
Soviet Union or Russia if you like back

76
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:34,200
in 1968 and we and during the years 20

77
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:37,890
the whole period after this 1968

78
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,650
invasion until the fall of communism in

79
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:43,140
the Czechoslovakia we were fed by

80
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,690
propaganda that this was not an

81
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,800
occupation or invasion but that was a

82
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:51,469
brotherly help

83
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,810
so we perfectly understand what hostile

84
00:05:51,470 --> 00:06:00,780
propaganda is and we are perfectly aware

85
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:07,080
of the methods Russia and the Russian

86
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:09,869
state Kremlin is using we stepped into

87
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,169
this arena which you can imagine that is

88
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:18,300
not comfortable like three and a half

89
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:22,040
years ago and we I had in mind the quote

90
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:26,960
of Edmund Burke the Irish statesman

91
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:30,240
and philosopher of the 18th century

92
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,140
saying the only thing necessary for the

93
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:40,080
triumph of evil is for good men do

94
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:43,409
nothing due to the fact that basically

95
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:47,190
our system knows about about everything

96
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,680
in the world I mean about things that

97
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,510
are being published in news or the

98
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,740
events that are being or topics that are

99
00:06:51,510 --> 00:07:01,440
being commented or published in news

100
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:03,930
this slide came across three and a half

101
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,910
three and a half years ago and what he

102
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:13,100
basically show

103
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:17,880
is the psychological preparation of

104
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:22,320
annexation of Crimea and it shows how

105
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:25,650
the Russian propaganda machine influence

106
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:31,469
to try to influence the Russian public

107
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:35,099
opinion so so Russian people are are

108
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,470
okay are comfortable with with with

109
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,890
Russia starting the war as as you know

110
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:45,090
most of you war is very unpopular thing

111
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:47,310
in Russia and they have they had to

112
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:51,570
prepare grounds so what you see on the

113
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:54,630
chart and visualizations are in most of

114
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,480
the cases the only way how to understand

115
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:01,620
big data and this chart was created from

116
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:06,660
hundreds of millions of articles the

117
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:12,480
chart starts in June 2011 and ends up in

118
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:17,490
February 2014 when the occupation in of

119
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,770
Crimea the operation started and what

120
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,130
the the red columns show the negative

121
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:27,870
sentiment on Ukraine not just as a

122
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:31,260
keyword but as a semantic object or

123
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:38,100
abstract object semantic category which

124
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:44,280
comprises of of all the cities and

125
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:47,780
regions and and industries and the

126
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,459
government and the President and so on

127
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,380
while the blue column showed the

128
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:57,060
negative sentiment in English global

129
00:08:52,380 --> 00:09:00,510
media there are two there are two things

130
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,569
that struck to my eyes first of all in

131
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,700
our system and I think this is in

132
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,850
general there is like five to six times

133
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,910
more of English content than Russian

134
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:15,270
content and you see there is on that

135
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,990
chart there is much less global content

136
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:21,689
so this is the first

137
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:24,930
difference according to the standard

138
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:29,220
situation and secondly and this is more

139
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:34,109
important that there is a clear negative

140
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:36,350
trend starting two years before the

141
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,960
annexation happen and our our

142
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:44,280
interpretation is clear that the Russian

143
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:47,310
government was or started preparation

144
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,650
for the annexation well before at least

145
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:54,689
in the information space two years

146
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:58,230
before it happened we wanted to bring I

147
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,750
wanted to bring an evidence that

148
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:06,770
something like large-scale manipulation

149
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,770
of public opinion exists and

150
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:15,030
unfortunately we got the chance to prove

151
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:19,439
it on on two very tragic events the

152
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:21,480
first is the shooting down the mh17 over

153
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,840
the eastern Ukraine by Russian system

154
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:32,630
and the second at the second event

155
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:36,270
similar a tragic one downing downing the

156
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:39,180
downing of the Russian civilian airplane

157
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:46,800
full of people belonging to Metro jet

158
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:49,859
airline over scene I Egypt so again the

159
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,630
red color reflects the number in this

160
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,850
case it reflects the number of articles

161
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:59,910
on that given event in Russian media and

162
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:03,710
in both on both charts and the blue line

163
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:07,980
the blue color represents the number of

164
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:11,790
English on articles on those events in

165
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:18,930
English language so you see big two big

166
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:24,180
differences while while the the second

167
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:27,969
event the metrojet event had a similar

168
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,339
proportion or appropriate proportion

169
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,470
although it was slightly more than one

170
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:38,289
to five or one to six but of course all

171
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,449
the event was related to Russians to

172
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:44,229
Russian people because all of the

173
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:47,079
victims or casualties were Russians then

174
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:52,089
we see that there's basically same

175
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:55,689
pattern how the media were providing the

176
00:11:52,089 --> 00:12:00,269
news coverage the pattern or the

177
00:11:55,689 --> 00:12:03,248
individual spikes are were triggered by

178
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:06,339
by new information emerging new

179
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:10,089
information for example like their that

180
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:13,679
they found out that an employee of the

181
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:16,720
airport security brought an explosive

182
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:20,348
explosives to the luggage of the

183
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,379
airplane when you compare it to the

184
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:25,479
upper chart you see that there's basic

185
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:31,059
that is completely proportional and

186
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:33,429
secondly there's no pattern and clearly

187
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:37,238
the Russian government wanted to

188
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:40,539
downplay the event internally

189
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:48,059
domestically as much as possible

190
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:48,059
and this chart shows the the I would say

191
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:56,649
almost unimaginable grip the Russian or

192
00:12:54,249 --> 00:13:01,529
the control of Russian government over

193
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:04,179
the Russian media and and mainly this

194
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:10,709
please take into account that this chart

195
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:13,209
has not been made out of like tens of

196
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:17,319
different sources from mainstream media

197
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:23,258
but the chart both charts as far as

198
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:26,498
Russian sources where were drawn or were

199
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:33,819
created based on analysis of twenty four

200
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:37,929
thousand sources unfortunately all our

201
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:39,500
work or or our analysis show that public

202
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:42,530
opinion is

203
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:46,310
just a mirror image image over critical

204
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:50,630
mass of online media in other words

205
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:53,420
there's a very high correlation of the

206
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:58,370
public opinion and and the critical mass

207
00:13:53,420 --> 00:14:03,020
and this is known and this is known not

208
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:06,400
only to us but is it is well known to

209
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:09,980
the to our adversaries who are

210
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:14,390
leveraging or using or abusing this

211
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:19,970
knowledge the chart that you see beneath

212
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:24,230
the statement shows that there was no

213
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:27,140
surprise that Donald Trump won the

214
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:31,160
elections and became the US president

215
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:35,449
the blue the blue cha the blue columns

216
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:39,350
show the number of mentions on online

217
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:43,790
news of Hillary Clinton why why the red

218
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:47,690
red columns show show dimensions of the

219
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:51,050
sheer volume of mentions of Donald Trump

220
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:55,160
so Donald Trump used to work as a

221
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:59,420
steamroller and basically by the sheer

222
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,189
volume he was able to win a to win at

223
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:05,060
the election and I think this principle

224
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:10,730
please please remember and we'll come to

225
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:18,260
it later on so if you have the critical

226
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:21,340
mass if you have a creek if you have a

227
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:27,490
critical mass of the online news content

228
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:31,160
over time it influences or it creates

229
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:35,180
the public opinion and basically these

230
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:39,290
two elements are two sides of the same

231
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,150
of the hyper object that is here and the

232
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:46,250
one that is able to control this hyper

233
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:49,750
object basically controls controls the

234
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,750
minds of people

235
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,390
since I wanted to talk a little bit also

236
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:00,590
about Russian propaganda and then we'll

237
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:08,060
switch to to two other topic the main

238
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:10,820
one about the sad role of online social

239
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,280
networks mainly Facebook I would like to

240
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,460
share with you the key narratives

241
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:21,339
Russian propaganda is using the key one

242
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,340
is relative ization of the truth

243
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:30,140
basically what what they are what they

244
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:30,890
are aiming to is us not to believe to do

245
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,410
anything

246
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:38,270
and once we believe once we stop

247
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:42,800
believing in the truth and in our

248
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:44,870
institutions they believe that the

249
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,630
structure the structure of our democracy

250
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:50,570
of structure of our democratic societies

251
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:54,680
will collapse and they will be able to

252
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:57,760
impose impose their rule of law which is

253
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:02,959
bite an organized-crime

254
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:05,900
so the ratification of the truth is in

255
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,930
the centre and the other key narratives

256
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:12,800
are the entire democracy narrative the

257
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:14,690
entire NATO narrative the entire EU

258
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,129
which is very strong mainly in this

259
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:23,480
mainly in this country the entire us

260
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:27,050
narrative entire minorities and of

261
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:32,120
course all kinds of set of pro-kremlin

262
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:35,270
narratives one of which you can one of

263
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:39,649
which is for example that manipulative

264
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:42,830
portrayal of a Russian of non-aggression

265
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,320
of Russia that Russia has never started

266
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,870
any war like there was no Molotov

267
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,780
Ribbentrop pact when Russia invaded

268
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:53,000
Poland at the beginning of second world

269
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:58,540
war just a few days after the Germans

270
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:02,630
did that from the west and and that

271
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:05,200
Russia did not invade Georgia or the

272
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,160
eastern part of you

273
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,200
so when I'm talking about this

274
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:13,270
information here is the here's the

275
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:17,980
definition which I believe is correct

276
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:23,960
this information is basically just a

277
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:27,740
translation burro translation from from

278
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:31,310
Russian destined for Mattia was a

279
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:36,350
department of KGB which was focused on

280
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:38,540
so-called black propaganda and the

281
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:43,310
prevailing model of this information is

282
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:46,490
that it starts with with just a limited

283
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:51,409
number of sources which are on the

284
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:55,960
bigger larger or lesser control of of

285
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:58,790
the Russian government and the source

286
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,330
publish this particle source publish

287
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:04,659
this information which is then which is

288
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,850
then republished by affiliated sources

289
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,380
to give you an example from our country

290
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,669
from Czech Republic from the Czech

291
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:18,200
Republic at the beginning there are like

292
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:22,430
less or Trenor around 20 of of toxic

293
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,650
sources out of which 5 of them are

294
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,350
creating most of the noise or most of

295
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,600
the toxic content so it is a very it's

296
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:32,719
it's very targeted or very focused

297
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:41,719
effort or beginning of the

298
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:44,540
disinformation spread and and just you

299
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,700
know I think you'll be intrigued by the

300
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,210
information that in case of the Czech

301
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:53,630
Republic those 20 sources produce around

302
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:56,060
70% 7 0 % of all the disinformation

303
00:19:53,630 --> 00:20:01,130
which is published in in the Czech

304
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:04,820
Republic and our system keeps keeps I or

305
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:08,960
analyze information articles coming from

306
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:14,120
over 4,000 sources so 20 produced 70

307
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:17,690
percent of all the toxic content so but

308
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:22,158
the pre but the model is or prevailing

309
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:26,029
that the the toxic messages or the this

310
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:29,679
information is then disseminated and

311
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:33,230
amplified by online social networks and

312
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,379
by far the worst role the darkest roll

313
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:39,169
place Facebook and this is a reason why

314
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:49,668
I will focus in my in my coming slides

315
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:53,570
next slides on Facebook you you in the

316
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:57,590
audience are very much uncomfortable

317
00:20:53,570 --> 00:21:01,730
with the level of state controlled or

318
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:04,490
state-owned old surveillance in which

319
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:07,850
the facial recognition technology plays

320
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:14,269
a key role or significant role and I

321
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:18,649
share and I share your your views on

322
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:21,950
that the thing I would say the bad thing

323
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:25,639
is that those are the companies that are

324
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:28,929
that are bringing this facial

325
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:32,120
recognition technology to new heights

326
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:36,379
are mostly Chinese companies and they

327
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:40,158
are getting funding like the face to

328
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:41,418
face plus one getting like

329
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,330
three-quarters of billions of dollars

330
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:49,759
but there are others getting billions of

331
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:52,850
dollars also from the West and China is

332
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:58,309
clearly the pioneering I would say the

333
00:21:52,850 --> 00:22:02,149
industry of state-controlled society and

334
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:06,009
they are using they are using the

335
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:09,350
methods or or they're leveraging

336
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:17,330
artificial intelligence in those efforts

337
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:21,500
that come big time if we if we think or

338
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:25,699
if we take a look what how many data

339
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:29,720
points facial recognition takes into

340
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:31,040
account and basically on these data

341
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,460
points

342
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:39,860
the state is able to provide the

343
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:43,549
surveillance of their citizens it's not

344
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,918
that it's not that my name and if you

345
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:49,309
compare it with what Facebook is

346
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:53,840
collecting not only on its users but

347
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:58,610
everybody who who somehow get into

348
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:01,309
contact with a Facebook user or or the

349
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:04,159
one that is not a Facebook user but has

350
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:07,399
a but has a friend or is contact in

351
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:12,980
facebook users so this is the this is

352
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:16,760
the overview of Facebook algorithmic

353
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:19,190
Factory this is I mean the visualization

354
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:23,540
is not coming from semantic visions but

355
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:27,280
it is it is work or so this is the

356
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:31,280
result of analysis of share Foundation

357
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,010
and there will be there will be a couple

358
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:39,020
of animations now so at the beginning we

359
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:43,629
will focus on this left upper part and

360
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:49,210
we'll take a look what Facebook is

361
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:52,910
collecting in this part so it starts by

362
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:56,169
among other things with with downloading

363
00:23:52,910 --> 00:24:01,040
all the contacts the particular user has

364
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:10,299
we may take a look to a different part

365
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:13,428
of Facebook algorithmic Factory which is

366
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:18,620
again the data collection on the data

367
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:23,900
collection site and will and you see

368
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:27,709
what kind of data or information Google

369
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:30,610
collects on on each of its user in a

370
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:35,320
standard way like your religious views

371
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:38,389
gender your political views and so on

372
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:42,990
let's take a look to slightly different

373
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:47,460
part of the diagram

374
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:49,860
it goes after your relationships whether

375
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,650
you are married or your we are in love

376
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:56,760
somebody or you're open to to

377
00:24:52,650 --> 00:25:00,620
relationship which is by far more

378
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:05,220
intimate than then your face of course

379
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:08,790
if we go further and take a look on this

380
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:11,040
part of the island algorithmic Factory

381
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:15,710
powered by artificial intelligence of

382
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:19,560
course we see the social graph the

383
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:24,420
Facebook and the the algorithm creates

384
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:27,120
around each user and it's basically it

385
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:31,740
Maps all the social interaction the

386
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:35,399
particular user conduct and as I said

387
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:37,950
before as most of you know you can be

388
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,040
disconnected from from Facebook but once

389
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:44,390
you are online and one of your or some

390
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,950
of your friends are Facebook users or

391
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,770
even if they don't use Facebook but

392
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,300
their friends are on Facebook then they

393
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:59,850
basically know almost everything about

394
00:25:51,300 --> 00:26:02,639
you so compared to this the NSA

395
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:09,409
surveillance capability is a just

396
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:12,300
child's play what Mark Zuckerberg

397
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:15,840
because he is them he's responsible for

398
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:18,780
the juggernaut for the monster that he

399
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,350
created is not connecting people of

400
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:26,129
course but it is to steal your identity

401
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:33,389
and sell it for manipulations aim of

402
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:41,490
which is aiming its users to to do to

403
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:46,880
want to believe and do what Facebook and

404
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:46,880
its customers want to

405
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,800
but there's there's a dark bonus of

406
00:26:52,770 --> 00:27:00,879
Zuckerberg and I already told about the

407
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,520
child's play of of NSA which is the

408
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,930
several surveillance squad as a service

409
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:11,260
and this is basically what what brings

410
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:16,150
money to Facebook and if you return to

411
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:19,030
that to that rhythmic factory diagram

412
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:26,530
and take a look on the on the right side

413
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:30,399
which is the targeting ad targeting we

414
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:33,280
would seem for example the kind of

415
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,580
political use the the Facebook is

416
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,830
collecting on on people that have

417
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:43,929
somehow relationships some relationship

418
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:46,120
with with us politics as all of us know

419
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:51,360
there's not just Facebook or Facebook

420
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:57,090
incorporated has four or has four

421
00:27:51,360 --> 00:28:00,459
services Facebook is just one of it and

422
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:05,550
the important thing is that that

423
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:09,880
Facebook as a service Instagram

424
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:14,409
messenger and whatsapp are all connected

425
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:17,830
and interconnected and this provides the

426
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:21,490
surveillance on a completely new new

427
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:25,540
level and all that all the lies of Mark

428
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:27,640
Zuckerberg that once he will encrypt the

429
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:31,930
communication on what side for example

430
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:36,430
this is just a and it's just a

431
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:42,540
smokescreen of what Facebook and Mark

432
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:46,000
Zuckerberg is aiming to what is behind

433
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:49,409
behind is the artificial intelligence or

434
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,550
machine learning algorithm mark

435
00:28:49,410 --> 00:29:00,630
micro-targeting which is providing as

436
00:28:54,550 --> 00:29:00,629
exact precise as as possible

437
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:06,450
and what what they need to do what

438
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:11,159
Facebook needs to do is to create as

439
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:14,030
small targets as possible as small of as

440
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:19,470
small groups of people sharing the same

441
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:22,080
views or hobbies and so on as

442
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,000
homogeneous groups as possible at the

443
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,159
same time big as small as possible and

444
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:34,520
by being able to sell sell these

445
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:38,480
profiles or identities of of the people

446
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:43,740
involved or being part of those

447
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:46,080
information bubbles they are Facebook is

448
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:49,880
divided into society fragmented in the

449
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:55,189
society atomizing the such the society

450
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:59,460
and this way Facebook is able to

451
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:03,360
increase its revenue in orders of

452
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:06,300
magnitude so the more precise at the

453
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,909
higher much higher in orders of

454
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:14,730
magnitude to Facebook but this is not

455
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:19,170
enough what Facebook needs more further

456
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:21,660
is to keep its cause the so called user

457
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:27,540
engagement to keep its user as long as

458
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:29,550
possible in front of their app and they

459
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,879
are using all kinds of tricks and

460
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:37,050
neuroscience tricks providing doses of

461
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:40,850
dopamine to its users through likes and

462
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:44,250
the the artificial intelligence behind

463
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:48,600
basically on the big data of over 2

464
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:52,770
billion people you know in a rather long

465
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:57,510
period of time it realized the

466
00:30:52,770 --> 00:31:01,440
weaknesses of us as people and the

467
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:06,690
increasing user engagement is using

468
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:10,050
methods or the or the knowledge that the

469
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:14,470
machine learning algorithms gained which

470
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:16,720
is that we are we are selfish we love to

471
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:21,970
here what we think we'll love to be

472
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:25,169
adored and this is first part and the

473
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:29,530
second part is that the more radical

474
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:34,390
content Facebook provides us for example

475
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:39,250
in though in the form of news feeds the

476
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:41,320
more attention it grabs and by

477
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,679
optimization of the society and

478
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:48,100
radicalization the the collateral damage

479
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:53,169
is that finally there's a destruction of

480
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:58,750
society well the negative aspects of

481
00:31:53,169 --> 00:32:02,559
online social networks we have come to

482
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:09,130
mainstream just after the u.s.

483
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:13,570
presidential elections in 2016 but since

484
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:15,730
you are I would say since you are people

485
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,649
who who have a deeper knowledge I

486
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:22,030
believe that most of you recognize that

487
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:24,520
already much much earlier so the u.s.

488
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:30,039
presidential elections didn't bring any

489
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:34,450
casualties but the a the Facebook

490
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:36,580
brought thousands of casualties in in

491
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,610
the process of radicalization of the

492
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:42,879
Middle East population all the wars in

493
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:49,500
Syria and Isis to Facebook was a major

494
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:53,409
tool for recruiting Isis warriors and

495
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:56,770
Mark Zuckerberg has hands and hands

496
00:32:53,409 --> 00:33:00,220
dirty with blood of thousands of people

497
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:04,600
and but not only that he's responsible

498
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:11,500
for for millions of people being

499
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:14,199
displaced within the Middle East let me

500
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:19,390
now show you a couple of abstract slides

501
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:22,380
conceptual slides in the past media aim

502
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:26,110
to be neutral and to provide objective

503
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,770
reporting you may disagree but this was

504
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,409
the prevailing model

505
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,090
and all the media laws are written in

506
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:35,179
that sense to distinguish between

507
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:39,139
objective reporting and an opinion

508
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:42,740
journalism or providing opinions so

509
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,990
please consider it as a model so at the

510
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:49,490
beginning there were neutral media and

511
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:53,150
and Facebook in the center or in the

512
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:58,940
middle was also neutral but during the

513
00:33:53,150 --> 00:34:07,070
course of time by by application of the

514
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:09,260
algorithms I explained before the the

515
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:14,029
particular users of Facebook get

516
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:21,139
polarized get radicalized and as a

517
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:26,780
result the there was there appeared or

518
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:31,429
emerged a demand for news sources that

519
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:39,649
reflect the increasingly radicalized

520
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:44,450
users and and in at the same time the

521
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:50,270
demand of our demand for neutral or

522
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:54,158
objective media shrinked but this is not

523
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:59,509
enough because there's a negative

524
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,790
feedback loop the the users of Facebook

525
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:06,260
they they are interested in more and

526
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:09,920
more radical views so the the media

527
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,650
became more and more radical and at the

528
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,359
same time the negative feedback loop

529
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:20,840
also impacts or influences the

530
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:27,200
increasingly the increasing shrinking of

531
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:30,230
the neutral media space so talking about

532
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,879
this information we don't have this

533
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,730
information on this slide yet or the

534
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,310
oldest in this model yet even if

535
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:41,280
Russians or Chinese or the Islamic state

536
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:44,340
or other forces in the Middle East

537
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:48,380
would not would not be distributing or

538
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:54,450
disseminating disinformation the public

539
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:57,150
is already radicalized and they they in

540
00:35:54,450 --> 00:36:01,890
increasing way they vote for the extreme

541
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:07,560
parties or they or they don't

542
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:10,529
participate in the democratic process so

543
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:16,110
Facebook the story of Facebook is

544
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:18,540
continuous live in the we start from the

545
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:20,310
left you see congressional hearings of

546
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:27,120
Mark Zuckerberg I think it was spring

547
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:30,720
last year when among others he denied he

548
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:34,580
denied the Facebook capability of

549
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:38,580
listening or controlling microphone of

550
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:40,410
its users on their in their smartphones

551
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,540
and listening to their private

552
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:47,250
conversations at home or kitchen or in

553
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:53,370
bedroom it turned out it turned out just

554
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:55,620
recently that that was true Mark

555
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:58,020
Zuckerberg called that allegation as a

556
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,720
conspiracy theory but again it turned

557
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:05,310
out to be true based on the information

558
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:08,120
that was published in June another

559
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:11,040
another case that you are familiar with

560
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:16,440
the shooting in New Zealand in

561
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:19,680
Christchurch when the New Zealand the

562
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,250
government of New Zealand urged or was

563
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,580
requesting Facebook to to stop

564
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:30,330
disseminating the video coverage of the

565
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:33,720
shooting and Facebook was pretending was

566
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:35,870
lying that it is doing then the Privacy

567
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:41,660
Commissioner of the Minister for private

568
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:46,680
protecting private data called Facebook

569
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:51,170
pathological liars and as most of you if

570
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,169
not all of you are fond of

571
00:37:51,470 --> 00:38:00,319
a cyber of cyber currencies based on

572
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:03,440
built on blockchain all of you know

573
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,650
about Libre Facebook is pretending that

574
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,960
it is on a blockchain but actually their

575
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:15,940
Facebook blockchain does not contain

576
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,940
blocks neither change so so liar liar

577
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:24,529
pants on fire but this is not enough

578
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:30,490
what scares me to death

579
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:33,950
is Facebook attempts or initiative and

580
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:38,029
supporting research and buying acquiring

581
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:45,379
companies that are building brain to

582
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:49,570
computer interface at the time being how

583
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:52,700
mark zuckerberg explaining that is that

584
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:55,700
they want to help people we heard that

585
00:38:52,700 --> 00:39:00,830
in the past and I believe that his only

586
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:03,560
goal is to control to once his able core

587
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:06,140
Facebook is able to read the minds then

588
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:12,790
it is just one step from being able to

589
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:12,790
control to implant ideas to our minds

590
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,080
this is done famous quote of Mark

591
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:22,070
Zuckerberg which was published

592
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:24,140
repeatedly last time in in the book of

593
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:28,270
Ben Mezrich which was called Bitcoin

594
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:31,970
billionaires about the Winklevoss twins

595
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:32,509
so you can be unethical and still be

596
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,970
illegal

597
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,970
that's the way I live my life

598
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:48,849
the human society since the dawn of its

599
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:52,170
existence of humankind it was it was

600
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:56,770
built on cohesion on collaboration

601
00:39:52,170 --> 00:40:00,790
empathy responsibility and ethics while

602
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:04,500
Facebook which was founded in 2004 is

603
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:10,000
built on digital disintegration which

604
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:12,869
which aim or which results in

605
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,010
optimization of the society in

606
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:18,810
controversy they are using the principle

607
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:22,720
of controversy which results in

608
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:25,170
radicalization of the society it uses

609
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,149
the principle of promoting selfishness

610
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:32,280
through addiction of those dopamine

611
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:35,680
doses it is based on principle of

612
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:41,830
irresponsibility it's completely on an

613
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:46,180
anonymous environment which welcomed the

614
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:50,920
worst from us and the algorithms that

615
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:55,960
power Facebook monster doesn't don't

616
00:40:50,920 --> 00:41:00,790
have any any dimension any social or

617
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,680
ethical dimension you can you can view

618
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,980
this understand that comprehend that

619
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,868
also as a process so through the

620
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,089
cohesion and collaboration empathy

621
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:12,930
responsibility and ethics we became

622
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:15,700
humans so it's a process of humanization

623
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:19,180
why on the other side on the opposite

624
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:21,790
side Facebook being built on

625
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,830
disintegration controversy promoting

626
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:27,520
selfishness irresponsibility and North

627
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,270
ethics is provides a nasty the

628
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:35,470
humanization

629
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:40,509
of mankind so I would like to and before

630
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:42,549
going to the last slide power tends to

631
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:49,060
corrupt and absolute power corrupts

632
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:51,070
absolutely you may know that that Mark

633
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,770
Zuckerberg is not responsible to anybody

634
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:55,619
but himself

635
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:58,230
it's a big exception of public companies

636
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:01,710
he holds 60% of voting rights

637
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:05,730
he cannot be he cannot be he cannot be

638
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:10,040
put down of his throne of president and

639
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:26,849
CEO and I would like to ask you to help

640
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:30,210
to help him and to help stop him thank

641
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:32,550
you Frank for four very interesting and

642
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:35,010
definitely disrupting presentation and I

643
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:37,550
would like to give you the space for the

644
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,550
questions

645
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:50,080
thanks for the talk first of all sorry I

646
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:53,080
took several notes I have some questions

647
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:55,299
um the first question regarding the

648
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,430
first part of the presentation do you

649
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,280
regarding misinformation do you mostly

650
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:03,580
focus on Russia like or do you also

651
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,820
provide other reports about other

652
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:09,700
countries other topics etc because you

653
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:15,970
seem to single out that misinformation

654
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:17,980
was only a feature of China and Russia

655
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:20,529
for instance but I come from a

656
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:24,130
democratic country in Europe where at

657
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:26,920
some point the muammar qaddafi was a

658
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:29,530
rabid dog he then became a very nice

659
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,660
individual where people should trade

660
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:35,410
with them and then you all all of a

661
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:37,839
sudden he became a rabid dog again so

662
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:40,390
it's that or Willian thing that we're

663
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:45,960
always been is war in war with Eastasia

664
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:49,000
even like yesterday we weren't also

665
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:52,180
sorry sir may I ask my response now

666
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,490
because and you may raise the second

667
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,230
part of your question later on I share

668
00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:02,500
your frustration and muammar qaddafi

669
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:05,700
case is say the bad example of how was

670
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:09,850
the media and the Western governments

671
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:11,410
presented him that that is for sure

672
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:14,799
but I would like to distinguish between

673
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:16,569
them between misinterpretation sorry

674
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,180
between misinformation and as

675
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:24,420
information and the disinformation is

676
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:27,819
large-scale state controlled or managed

677
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,370
information operations goal of which is

678
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,560
to change the public opinion and don't

679
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:36,730
you think that happens in the US for

680
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:39,640
instance you mean by the US government

681
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:44,230
yeah or some agencies that depend on the

682
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:47,230
US government I don't share that level

683
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:53,650
of frustration of course the West is not

684
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:55,950
without is not without any guilt but it

685
00:44:53,650 --> 00:45:00,180
is uncomfortable what

686
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:03,290
that little rain totalitarian systems

687
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:08,549
are doing like Russia or China or Iran

688
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:09,330
okay arm joined back and also continuing

689
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:12,470
on this one

690
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:15,420
don't you think that like forcing

691
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:17,459
Facebook or YouTube or Google for

692
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,680
instance and using allowed mostly on

693
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:23,090
Facebook but also I think that there are

694
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:27,839
several other concerning exactly space

695
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:30,180
don't you think that forcing those like

696
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,030
government regulating those those

697
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:36,149
companies to police thought will also

698
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:38,700
have an impact given that today most of

699
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:41,550
the people interact and share ideas and

700
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,890
on those faces so if the government's

701
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:47,100
give Facebook the power to deem what's

702
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,990
misinformation what's like reasonable

703
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:51,089
opinions what's not reasonable opinions

704
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,399
that actually like putting people on

705
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:58,460
even smaller and smaller boxes at some

706
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,460
point well thank you for that question

707
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:03,750
me personally I believe that Facebook

708
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:09,650
has to be regulated I know that

709
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:13,500
regulations are not the measures allow

710
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:15,570
but the world would be much much worse

711
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:19,950
pace if there would be no regulation on

712
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:22,140
banks for example I don't I don't

713
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:24,210
believe that the regulation should be on

714
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,400
the content level like providing

715
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:30,330
censorship and providing some sort of a

716
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:34,230
Ministry of the truth but it has to be

717
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:39,420
on the level of algorithms for example I

718
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:43,460
think the easiest way would be to to set

719
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:46,970
the threshold for for the granularity of

720
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:49,380
the groups or micro might for Mike

721
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:52,140
micro-targeting that'll be pretty easy

722
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,620
so the system would not work with and

723
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:58,920
this is just an example with 1 million

724
00:46:54,620 --> 00:47:01,319
different groups optimizing the society

725
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:06,000
but just with one thousand again this is

726
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:09,550
an example only so this way we would we

727
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,320
would we would drastically me

728
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:17,350
great the problems that come out of

729
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:22,990
fragmenting the society and secondly I

730
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:27,009
believe that we should or the government

731
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:32,669
the government should regulate or put

732
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:38,890
light on on on that department addiction

733
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:42,880
drug addiction which Facebook is has

734
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:45,310
imposed on on majority of population so

735
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,220
no content no censorship just look at

736
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:49,840
the algorithms okay but by looking at

737
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,629
the algorithm is you could eventually

738
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:55,120
create a system that it would be not

739
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,340
that different obviously not the

740
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,020
political implications but it could meet

741
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,150
not that different from the social

742
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,340
credit in China where let's say I have

743
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:07,420
friends with very in popular opinions

744
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:09,430
and like and they spread what maybe you

745
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,020
would consider misinformation or maybe I

746
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:13,960
would consider misinformation because

747
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:17,259
they have their very own unique opinions

748
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:20,500
but by virtue of me and I don't use any

749
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:23,200
Facebook services but by virtue of me

750
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:26,010
being connected with those persons maybe

751
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,450
the algorithm will eventually censor

752
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:30,010
also my interactions with other people

753
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,470
because I'm again active to that person

754
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:34,500
so again I will repeat that again I

755
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,850
believe that the regulation should not

756
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,730
should not include any kind of

757
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:43,900
censorship just regulation of algorithms

758
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:47,740
of creating the the information bubbles

759
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:51,990
and the neuroscience and abuse of

760
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,990
neuroscience ok thank you

761
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:04,270
I'd like to connect to this to to the

762
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:09,440
previous question and to your reaction I

763
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:12,020
would argue that limiting algorithms

764
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,080
wouldn't really help because I think the

765
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,960
main problem of Facebook is the

766
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:21,950
misalignment of the business model

767
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:27,020
because because of the freemium business

768
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:31,730
model because Facebook earns money based

769
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:34,970
on the advertisements if we had maybe a

770
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:40,880
social network where users users have to

771
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:43,850
pay then the the network would would

772
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,370
have incentives to do the best service

773
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:48,140
for them and not not for the customers I

774
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:52,190
completely agree with you there's this

775
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:54,560
is excellent point but the the situation

776
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:59,810
the reality is that we have the Facebook

777
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:02,600
and and the services that that is it it

778
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:06,140
consists of and there's already

779
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:11,630
addiction everybody's on Facebook and we

780
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:14,390
and the public things that that the

781
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:18,530
service is for free and it's not able to

782
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:21,230
recognize to comprehend that Facebook is

783
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:23,690
selling the identities of its office

784
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:25,850
users in the in the perfect world I

785
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:29,090
completely agree with you we have social

786
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:32,750
network which is based on a subscription

787
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:35,030
but I don't think that we can force and

788
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:36,020
force that maybe this could be a way but

789
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:40,700
I doubt it

790
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:43,700
because this is not only Facebook which

791
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:46,779
is causing the problem of micro

792
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:51,439
targeting but it's also Google a mainly

793
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:55,610
YouTube channel which is pretty close to

794
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:58,070
the negative impact on society yeah

795
00:50:55,610 --> 00:51:00,470
thank you for the talk yeah it was nice

796
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:04,550
to have some data to back our conspiracy

797
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:06,140
theories you invited us at the end of

798
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:10,040
your talk to

799
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:12,950
stop him how do you suggest we do that

800
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:19,400
and do you even think it's really

801
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:22,580
possible yes I hope so because I'm

802
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:27,410
eating stick by nature I think the first

803
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:29,259
thing is to provide the awareness of of

804
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:31,910
that problem of the problem that

805
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:37,630
Facebook or what is Facebook doing to

806
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:42,740
the society and each of us has certain

807
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:46,250
knowledge and and methods to help in

808
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:48,229
that fight yes but I feel like this is

809
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:51,740
something that works with people like us

810
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:54,410
that tend to attend these events etc but

811
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:57,620
what about normal people who just don't

812
00:51:54,410 --> 00:52:00,230
give a about this this is exactly

813
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:02,810
what who is the majority and basically

814
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:06,050
the people who are the targets and those

815
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:08,000
who feel all these problems basically I

816
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,380
can imagine that there is more

817
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,780
whistleblowers from Facebook

818
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:15,800
organizations for from Facebook

819
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:18,320
organization for example I can imagine

820
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:21,320
that since your most of you are are

821
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:26,210
geeks that you have friends somehow you

822
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:29,210
can get to get connection to those

823
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:33,710
people who are creating who have created

824
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:35,930
that that monster and maybe you can

825
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:42,400
provide information that will that would

826
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:46,040
help help mankind to fight this threat

827
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:50,030
okay so they would do what stop using it

828
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:52,700
or I probably want hmm

829
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:56,570
so of course the the great way is to

830
00:52:52,700 --> 00:53:02,299
vote by by your legs like leaving

831
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:05,620
Facebook forever but I think this is not

832
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:08,030
realistic because Facebook has monopoly

833
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:11,000
and if you're not on Facebook then you

834
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:15,980
have no friends at least certain parts

835
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,289
or major majority of people think in

836
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:24,049
that

837
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:27,220
so I am I'm I'm support or I believe

838
00:53:24,049 --> 00:53:30,619
that Facebook has to be regulated on a

839
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:34,189
only on the levy of European Union and

840
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:35,720
the US government but I know that the

841
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:38,299
state regulation is something that

842
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:46,549
you're not fond of so please think over

843
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:48,470
of methods how we can achieve that thank

844
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:51,079
you very much for the interesting talk

845
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:53,990
I would like to quit Facebook but there

846
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:57,200
is no problem the program of parallel

847
00:53:53,990 --> 00:54:00,558
nepalese is published on Facebook so I

848
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:03,740
have one wish could you please in a para

849
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:06,170
una police publish your program outside

850
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,899
of Facebook as well as it was possible

851
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:10,009
for the hackers Congress and then I have

852
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,430
one question

853
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:15,529
Kenna can i buy from facebook my

854
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:19,399
personal information everything that

855
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:22,910
they collect about me can i buy it good

856
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:25,460
one I think you could buy it once you

857
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:29,149
pretend that your marketing or digital

858
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,440
marketing agency if you pretend that you

859
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:33,109
didn't that even if you're not a

860
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:36,170
marketing agency they will sell you all

861
00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:40,989
the data about 2 billion people they

862
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:46,819
have including your Karim GPS location

863
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:49,579
it is available in the market hi thanks

864
00:54:46,819 --> 00:54:52,099
for the talk I have a quick question

865
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:55,789
regarding the motivation so you said

866
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:57,980
Facebook is doing this for greed because

867
00:54:55,789 --> 00:55:02,210
he's monetizing information about our

868
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:03,170
privacy but imagine that just like in

869
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,180
email

870
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:10,130
except for Gmail you can use protonmail

871
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:12,319
which hopefully is maintaining our

872
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:15,019
privacy and not collecting data on us so

873
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:17,089
if someone I mean let's let's be

874
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:18,709
hypothetical for now if someone came up

875
00:55:17,089 --> 00:55:21,799
with a with Facebook that doesn't

876
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:24,559
collect any information on us and just

877
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:25,940
provides the same service but but

878
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,619
doesn't sell it to anyone

879
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,810
the the phenomena that you are worried

880
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:33,500
about they would still be present right

881
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:35,779
the radicalization and sorry to

882
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:38,900
interrupt you in case the service is

883
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:41,600
based on subscription or at least is

884
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,460
managed by I don't know I mean seems to

885
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,839
me that this is orthogonal to that it's

886
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,640
somehow a social phenomenon what's

887
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,680
happening on Facebook that people tend

888
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,960
to like opinions that they agree with

889
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,970
and it radicalizes them or not I mean

890
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,250
that that's my question if there was

891
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:57,140
just someone running a copy of Facebook

892
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:59,540
out of charity and not trying to earn

893
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:03,259
money on that at all would the same

894
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:06,020
social behavior happen in case the the

895
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:08,930
clone and everyone would switch to the

896
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:11,270
clone no one is the cloud uses the same

897
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:15,680
algorithms then it would be just new

898
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:18,290
Facebook but but the alternative exists

899
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:23,240
like a subscription-based social

900
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:26,029
networks but it the difficulty is or the

901
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:28,580
problem is that it is not being used by

902
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:31,240
too many people and and as you know that

903
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:34,190
the big digital services they tend to

904
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:37,160
monopolize the entire environment so

905
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:42,800
people tend to be to use the service

906
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:47,240
which is used by the others so in the

907
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:51,260
perfect world we have a we have because

908
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:53,240
the service it costs something so the

909
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:57,230
users or the subscribers of the service

910
00:56:53,240 --> 00:57:02,660
pay for pay for the service therefore

911
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:07,070
the operator the operator gets covered

912
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:09,589
cost and reasonable profit and there

913
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:14,330
will be no intention of the operator of

914
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:18,440
the company operating this service to

915
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:23,210
radicalize and to fragment ice the

916
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:26,780
society ok thank this is my opinion ok

917
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:28,340
we have time for last question maybe

918
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,690
another question maybe more reaction

919
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:32,360
because this is also for me was a

920
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:34,340
question if the if you would clone it it

921
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,840
what will happen the same thing but in

922
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:37,820
this case I think we should also think

923
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,980
more about like digital communities and

924
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:43,220
what it really is you know that Facebook

925
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:44,869
is creating something like but it's not

926
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,910
community in the end but for example

927
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:50,060
when you look at the project as skip

928
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:52,640
areia Eska the point irska you know they

929
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:54,920
have a problem they need to get people

930
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,080
out there are people different opinions

931
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,730
but you know the feeling that you go

932
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,680
there and you share your opinion okay

933
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:02,660
right now we know that it was also

934
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,660
leaked about like this new political

935
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:07,730
party doesn't matter but the situation

936
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:10,759
that you dare and nobody is monetizing

937
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:12,560
what you are saying is that's the

938
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,780
feeling of the digital community and

939
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,640
clone of the Facebook would be like I

940
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:17,810
think still somebody it's not the

941
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,299
Facebook it's not the application

942
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:22,369
someone else would monetize it actually

943
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,960
so this is a this is for me like a big

944
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:26,810
question and I would like to thank you

945
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,810
mr. rubber for your presentation and for

946
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:32,290
sharing this idea with us so thank you

947
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,290

948
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:42,959
