elana said that it's her favorite topic

4
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,270
I have to say it's not my favorite topic

5
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,060
even though I decided to write a book

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,770
about this which I'm working on and one

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,129
of the reasons I don't like this topic

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,960
is that because it's basically something

9
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:46,089
that scares us we if we look at a

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,910
picture of camera surveilling us it's

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:53,920
not a nice picture it gives people

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:56,260
chills and the panopticon effect but I

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,110
feel that it's important to understand

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:02,290
it and even in crypto space very few

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,449
people understand how financial

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,970
surveillance actually works what is

17
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:11,700
being reported who receives the

18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:15,150
information and so on so ever since

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:20,170
maybe high school I was fascinated by

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:22,270
offshore companies and tax havens in

21
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,600
high school I didn't have much income so

22
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,090
I didn't have many taxes to avoid but I

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,619
really liked the idea that there is a

24
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,960
way out there how to avoid all these

25
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,990
surveillance and taxation and and kind

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,649
of get a little bit of freedom and one

27
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:45,369
of the reasons that I started looking at

28
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:51,930
financial surveillance is the backlash

29
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:56,170
and and and the attempts to crush these

30
00:01:51,930 --> 00:02:00,600
tax havens and actually what I would I

31
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:03,490
realized that the laws about

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,410
international taxation didn't change

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:10,869
that much recently and how this fight

34
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,000
against tax evasion actually works is

35
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:17,470
through the banking system so you can

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,870
still start an anonymous company or at

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,450
least relatively anonymous company in

38
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,690
one of these tax havens this is my

39
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:28,420
favorite Panama City many of these

40
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,940
buildings belongs to belong to banks

41
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,920
it's fairly developed there are some

42
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,030
countries that are not as developed as

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,859
as Panama

44
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,690
but basically the the way to start an

45
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,590
offshore company is always the same you

46
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:48,310
can do it it's it's doing business in in

47
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:51,530
a foreign country which is still allowed

48
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:55,070
so so we go you you register your

49
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:57,590
company you get your documents and then

50
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,959
you realize that it's very difficult to

51
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,270
open a bank account for this company and

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,800
that's actually how the enforcement

53
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:08,510
works so we need to understand a few

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,030
things about surveillance I got this

55
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:15,049
idea from Jonathan Loggins and Paul

56
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,000
Rosenberg's book the new age of the the

57
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,220
New Age of intelligence which I highly

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,450
recommend to read and the idea is this

59
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:27,980
so so if we look at this castle that's

60
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,720
the enforcement agencies these are the

61
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,540
rulers and we cannot see what's

62
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,480
happening inside it's just a big

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,100
building with walls and we don't know

64
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,049
what's going on inside how it actually

65
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:45,709
works so you can imagine this is NSA or

66
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:48,680
or some tax office financial police and

67
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,290
all these institutions this is what we

68
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,550
see there's some institution and we know

69
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:58,130
that it's watching us the view from the

70
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,160
castle is very different this is the

71
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,560
view from the castle if you stand up on

72
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,019
the wall and you look down you see

73
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,900
everything you see there's someone

74
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:12,680
walking they met they probably had an

75
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:15,290
affair you you can derive a lot of

76
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,510
information about these people even

77
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:22,490
though you don't see what actually

78
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:24,110
happens so so if two married people have

79
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,600
an affair with someone else and they

80
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,580
meet somewhere and then they get out and

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,090
their hair is messy you didn't need to

82
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,609
actually see them having sex in a barn

83
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,169
or or somewhere else you can derive

84
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,250
because you know a lot of information

85
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:43,909
about people you know okay this person

86
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:48,380
is married his wife is somewhere else

87
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:56,600
and so on so the view from the castle

88
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:59,870
is has these properties the only the

89
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,080
only only place where these analogy

90
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,580
doesn't hold is that there is no more

91
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,690
one castle there are many organizations

92
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,460
and the question is how well they shared

93
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:14,240
share the data how well they cooperate

94
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:17,960
because if they combine their views of

95
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,750
the general population the information

96
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:25,450
is even stronger and it can have even

97
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:31,730
more impact so I said that offshore is

98
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:36,469
no longer controlled or enforced by laws

99
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:39,890
but by by the banking system so the

100
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,900
first thing to understand is what is the

101
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:45,860
context there is a very clear difference

102
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,359
between targeted surveillance and mass

103
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:52,700
surveillance so targeted surveillance

104
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:57,170
means okay someone has reason to believe

105
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:59,539
that you are doing human trafficking or

106
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,580
something really bad they get a warrant

107
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,670
they come to your financial institution

108
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,030
and they say okay did there is a court

109
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,860
order the judge said you need to tell us

110
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:13,239
information about this person

111
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,970
so let's targeted surveillance even in

112
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,060
non-financial surveillance this works

113
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,130
pretty well and and it will continue

114
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,840
working it is very hard to protect

115
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:28,030
yourself against targeted surveillance

116
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,560
if you have your phone it is usually

117
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,469
using encryption sometimes the

118
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,350
end-to-end encryption which is very hard

119
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,780
to crack on the mass scale but what what

120
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:42,590
people or what these enforcement

121
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,780
agencies can do is they can attack your

122
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,780
phone specifically using zero-day

123
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,150
exploit or installing a back there or

124
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,849
something like that and then they can

125
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,640
learn more about you what I will be

126
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:59,900
talking about here is mass surveillance

127
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,340
that is watching all people like from

128
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,950
the view from the castle

129
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,989
and deriving information about everyone

130
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:09,680
so it's very important that these are

131
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:12,980
two very different ways on how to do

132
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:18,320
surveillance a lot of people say that I

133
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:21,380
really like the the graphics from the

134
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:26,180
CCC conference nothing to hide which is

135
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:29,090
which has a lot of censored context and

136
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,580
so I brought it up because of this issue

137
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,130
with transparency a lot of people say

138
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:38,030
that if you're not doing anything wrong

139
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:41,169
you should not be hiding anything and I

140
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:45,020
believe that this might be true for

141
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:47,060
governments and public institutions yes

142
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,240
they probably should be transparent so

143
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:53,210
we can all check them I'm not sure how

144
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,370
well it works in practice but that's

145
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:58,400
something that we can we can strive for

146
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,540
but if it's my personal information and

147
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:07,750
if I don't even do anything wrong I

148
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:11,930
might have for example both Kryptos in

149
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:14,060
2012 I might have bought 100 Bitcoin I

150
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:17,360
don't want anyone to know and it's not

151
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,310
because I'm I'm not willing to pay taxes

152
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,190
it's not because I'm using it for

153
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:26,419
something wrong I just don't want to be

154
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:30,200
a potential victim of blackmail and and

155
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,919
theft and I don't want other people to

156
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,819
threaten me

157
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:41,630
so I believe that privacy is legitimate

158
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:44,570
requirement and we should we should kind

159
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,089
of strive for keeping our privacy even

160
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,250
though we have nothing to hide we don't

161
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:55,130
need to be bad guys in order to want

162
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:59,540
privacy so how does it work who is the

163
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:03,800
police station in this and I would like

164
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,689
to start by a very interesting thought

165
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,290
that I got from Robin Hansen's book

166
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,410
elephant in the brain he was saying that

167
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,629
in the US

168
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:18,790
and some of some other countries it is

169
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:21,670
forbidden to drink alcohol in public so

170
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,730
we cannot just get a beer and walk

171
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:27,639
around on the street not the case in

172
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,129
Czech Republic and Germany at least not

173
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,879
in practice but what people do is they

174
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:36,329
they get a paper bag and they put the

175
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:39,910
bottle with alcohol in the paper bag

176
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:43,599
it's still not allowed and all the

177
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:47,079
police know that you're drinking alcohol

178
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,620
because why would I drink my water out

179
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:53,469
of a paper bag doesn't make any sense

180
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,240
what it does it gives an excuse to

181
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,550
police not to prosecute you

182
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,120
they have them done everything they have

183
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:06,389
seen nothing wrong so so they have an

184
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:09,069
excuse and this is interestingly how

185
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:12,339
financial institutions work if they want

186
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:14,740
you as a customer so so the states the

187
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:18,759
countries they kind of want banks to

188
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:22,120
enforce these anti-money laundering anti

189
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:24,069
tax evasion or all these rules on the

190
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,130
other hand the bank wants you as a

191
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:29,439
customer especially if you pay a high

192
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:33,269
enough fees so as Helena said there's a

193
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:37,120
lot of money being laundered every year

194
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:39,970
if you want to invest money with a

195
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,889
private bank they don't really care

196
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,569
where you got the money from but it's

197
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:46,329
not their business all they care about

198
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:49,240
this if you are going to pay the fees on

199
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:51,130
the on the trades and so on everything

200
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:56,410
like that so I had a very interesting

201
00:10:51,130 --> 00:11:00,399
experience a few years ago I I was

202
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:05,430
becoming a client of Bank and I went

203
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:09,920
through this am l know your customer

204
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:12,949
questionnaire and the banker said the

205
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,050
first of all he said I apologize this is

206
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,150
not going to be nice and I will probably

207
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,750
ask you how often you have sex and

208
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:23,240
what's your shoe size but in order to

209
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,570
make this work please answer these

210
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:30,560
questions but please answer only yes or

211
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:33,080
no so he kind of told me to put all my

212
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,030
financial history in the paper back he

213
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,250
didn't really want to know where again

214
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:40,579
where I got my money from he didn't

215
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:44,240
really want to you know hear my life

216
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:47,060
story and what kind of an entrepreneur I

217
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,000
am or anything like that even though I

218
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,010
had to send them my professional CV I

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,090
didn't ask for a loan so that they

220
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:59,870
didn't really care so he was asking me a

221
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:02,540
series of question and he specifically

222
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,760
requested that I only answer yes or no

223
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,400
because the only thing he wanted is to

224
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:12,290
fill this form and then have me as a

225
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:17,300
customer so when we kind of outsource

226
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:19,579
this policing this police station to to

227
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,060
these financial institutions which are

228
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:26,600
often private they're very effective at

229
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:30,439
what they need to do but the question is

230
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,300
if if they're doing what the countries

231
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,510
are trying to do them or they they're

232
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:39,050
kind of trying to to get an excuse okay

233
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:43,850
the alcohol is in paperback I don't need

234
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:46,280
to deal with this person so I'm going to

235
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,090
because it's very confusing there are so

236
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,680
many rules there are so many reports and

237
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:54,110
no one actually knows what kind of

238
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,510
information information gets reported to

239
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,920
who there are there are public

240
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,050
institutions there are private

241
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,780
institutions and they're very

242
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,670
interesting ways on how these rules are

243
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,520
made so first of all there is no your

244
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,250
customer probably every one of you

245
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:14,150
steadily had to go through one of these

246
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:16,310
processes and they're followed by all

247
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,350
the financial institutions including

248
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,510
most crypto exchanges that deal with

249
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,059
fiat currencies so they want to know

250
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,759
your identity who you are

251
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:28,449
is usually by showing some kind of ID

252
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,789
card or passport or something like that

253
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:34,998
they need to internally determined the

254
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:37,699
risk in terms of the tendency to commit

255
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:43,099
money laundering they are trying to

256
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:45,378
create customer profile and they they

257
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:48,889
will monitor your transactions against

258
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:51,819
expected behavior so that's why a lot of

259
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:56,059
financial institutions want to see

260
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:58,149
account movements account statements

261
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:00,889
from the previous banking institution

262
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:02,599
they probably also want a letter of

263
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:04,429
recommendation in order to see that

264
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:08,749
you're just a regular customer you're

265
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:11,089
not weird in any way then they will

266
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:12,559
probably ask you for a utility bill

267
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,169
which is the way to determine your

268
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,659
residency so tax residence is quite

269
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:21,978
complex and the rules about tax

270
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:24,559
residency are not unified but most

271
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:29,449
countries they want to know where you

272
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:32,779
usually reside and one of the ways that

273
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:34,758
is plausible is by showing your

274
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:36,349
electricity bills so if you are living

275
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,319
somewhere and you're paying for your

276
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:41,149
electricity or other utilities then

277
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:43,399
you're probably live there and then you

278
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:48,649
are probably a tax resident there so

279
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:51,019
that's that's interesting and very

280
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:52,669
sometimes want also your tax

281
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:56,299
identification number which is something

282
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:58,759
that the government assigns to you what

283
00:14:56,299 --> 00:15:01,789
is very important is that it is very

284
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:04,609
difficult to cheat the bank with nominee

285
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:08,468
shareholders and nominee director sits

286
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:12,139
directly fraud so what you can do even

287
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:15,979
now you can go to to Seychelles or to

288
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:18,289
Cyprus and you say I want to register a

289
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:20,359
company but I don't want to be publicly

290
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:23,749
visible so I'm going to hire a nominee

291
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:26,809
shareholder nominee beneficiary owner or

292
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:29,299
nominee director so these are the people

293
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:30,919
who will probably never met and they're

294
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:33,529
registered on the on the business

295
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:35,299
registry and they're the face of the

296
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,499
company in public and they have a

297
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:40,669
private contract with

298
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:43,279
which says okay I am on the public

299
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:46,369
business registry but this person

300
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,489
actually owns the company if you go to a

301
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:51,289
bank and you say this is the real owner

302
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:54,559
they will kick you out immediately like

303
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:56,959
that they have they have a list of

304
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,429
common nominee shareholders and actually

305
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,738
if you do it you're committing fraud

306
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:04,339
which equals jail time in most countries

307
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:07,519
so even though you have this perfectly

308
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:09,889
anonymous company if you have a bank

309
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,259
account the bank knows who is the

310
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:15,199
ultimate beneficiary owner and they will

311
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:19,039
report this information to your tax

312
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:23,228
office which we'll see later so one way

313
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:26,869
to do offshore these days is start

314
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:29,119
company in a tax haven but don't have a

315
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:31,669
bank account only use crypto so we will

316
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:34,099
talk a little bit more about that what

317
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:36,709
is important kyc is usually kept on a

318
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:39,799
file so this information is not directly

319
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:41,748
sent anywhere it is only available upon

320
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:45,108
a request so it's targeted surveillance

321
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:48,439
the problem is that sometimes the result

322
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:50,149
of of this kyc is that bank will not

323
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:55,129
want you as a customer or the financial

324
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:56,809
institution there are watch lists this

325
00:16:55,129 --> 00:17:01,729
is interesting and not many people know

326
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:04,878
about it watch lists are this global

327
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:07,399
lists of problematic people one of them

328
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:12,829
is called world checks by Thomson

329
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:17,928
Reuters and they use several sources in

330
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:19,698
order to compile this list and some of

331
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:23,600
the sources are not very nice so for

332
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:28,069
example they've been known to use gossip

333
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:31,219
media so if some tabloid published a

334
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:33,230
picture of you with a known terrorists

335
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,259
or something like that even though you

336
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,830
just you know went out of the bar and

337
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:41,509
the person was standing there they're

338
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,970
likely to include this information in

339
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:45,470
your world check file at least it

340
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,279
happened a few times and there are a few

341
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,279
documented

342
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,020
instances when this happened they also

343
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,710
use forums they're also very very weird

344
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:01,080
forums like some white supremacy nazi

345
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:05,220
forums where Nazis are discussing some

346
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:09,750
some Muslim people and and this is

347
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,130
actually used as a as a source of

348
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,540
information

349
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,230
[Music]

350
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:19,080
they're also recently started to use a

351
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:23,400
list of icos and advisors I have a

352
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:26,070
friend who became a technical adviser to

353
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,220
a company that did an ICO he was listed

354
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,110
on the web page and he had a problem to

355
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:35,550
open a bank account because he appeared

356
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:39,449
on one of these lists so so it's really

357
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:45,740
not nice what is the problem is that by

358
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:50,850
contract these watch lists they're

359
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:53,820
they're not the company says that the

360
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:56,699
financial institutions doesn't use this

361
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:59,310
as the only source of truth so they are

362
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,580
supposed to investigate better if you

363
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:06,360
appear on one of these lists the problem

364
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:09,300
is that usually when when you have a

365
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,820
yellow or red light and you are on this

366
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,010
list the bank will just refuse you but

367
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:17,639
they will never tell you why so it's

368
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:19,920
like oh sorry we will not do business

369
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,690
with you we are a private company and

370
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,750
your business risk goodbye so we will

371
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:28,620
never know that this is the reason why

372
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:31,620
why they don't do business with you so

373
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,389
kyc the next thing is tax residence I

374
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,580
said that it's usually determined by

375
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,750
utility bill there are some there's

376
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,909
something that is called tax

377
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,060
identification number that has been

378
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:44,580
rolled out through oecd not all

379
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:47,690
countries introduce the tax

380
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:50,490
identification number so when the bank

381
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,110
requests your tax identification number

382
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,450
and your country doesn't issue it

383
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,669
there's a website where you can say okay

384
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:01,890
this one didn't roll it out but other

385
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:04,710
than that you will probably need to

386
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:08,870
get this number and it's based on every

387
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,870
country does it a little bit differently

388
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:14,280
there are some people that don't have

389
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,590
tax residence these are for example

390
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,950
perpetual travelers that don't have any

391
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,899
kids don't own real estate and they're

392
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:25,860
just traveling all the time so they they

393
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:28,200
have no tax residency unfortunately this

394
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,750
is business risk for banks so they will

395
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,390
force you to say which countries your

396
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:37,320
tax residency even if you legally don't

397
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:40,950
have a tax residency and what is

398
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:44,850
important during the research about this

399
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:48,540
I was speaking to many members of of

400
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:52,790
Bank risk departments and they say that

401
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:55,830
they over report so if I'm a slovak

402
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:58,530
citizen or if I'm a german citizen I'm a

403
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:01,800
Panamanian tax resident in a Cypriot

404
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,960
bank the Cypriot bank will report to

405
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,409
both Germany and Panama just to be sure

406
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,200
so a lot of people say all cool I have a

407
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:12,170
YouTube utility bill from this tax haven

408
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,590
that means my bank won't report my

409
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:20,640
private information to to my country

410
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:23,340
where I'm citizen and haha that's that's

411
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,100
how I hacked this no it's not true they

412
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,709
they will report to like if they have

413
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,719
any suspicions if you have a wife from a

414
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,690
different country they will report to

415
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,630
that country as well because it's there

416
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:42,030
they don't treat this tax information as

417
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:44,430
private that much taxation itself is

418
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,590
quite difficult topic

419
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:50,400
I don't unfortunately have a lot of time

420
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:52,830
for it but tax reporting is automatic so

421
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,430
as I said kyc is kept on file and on

422
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,699
request

423
00:21:53,430 --> 00:22:00,090
but tax reporting is automatic

424
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,270
according to CRS we see this common

425
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,889
reporting standard it happens every year

426
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,350
at the end of the year they will report

427
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,810
that you have a bank account or an

428
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:13,370
exchange account they will report your

429
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:15,000
balance and if they know about any any

430
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,010
dividend income for

431
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,560
example that you had that they will also

432
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,830
report this so this is automatic you

433
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:27,389
cannot avoid it easily there is another

434
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:31,770
way how we can avoid CRS and that is by

435
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:35,160
by being in a country that didn't sign

436
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:37,710
it which the only fairly developed

437
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,400
country that didn't say CRS is USA and

438
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:45,330
the US territories so vodka is produced

439
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:48,570
predecessor to to CRS and it's a it's a

440
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:51,929
very interesting product of of the

441
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:55,950
United States that I export it to the

442
00:22:51,930 --> 00:23:00,300
world so so the only way to avoid this

443
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:04,350
is by not being an American and banking

444
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:07,710
in US or US territories even better so

445
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:10,879
Porto Rico US Virgin Islands anything

446
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:15,240
like that this could change anytime

447
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,490
because vodka is based on bilateral

448
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,010
agreements right now it excludes US

449
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:23,760
territories but that could change any

450
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:29,940
time or of course don't use bank and use

451
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:32,180
crypto there's this these are income

452
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,350
taxes dividends and account balances

453
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,710
also there is a lot of reporting

454
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:41,990
especially within you on other taxes

455
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:45,570
like VA T so we have vit forms which

456
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:48,690
companies need to send to their tax

457
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:51,240
office in order to say how much business

458
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,720
they did with within the European Union

459
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,600
this is mandatory requirement for anyone

460
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,970
who is paying dat also in some countries

461
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,649
like in Czech Republic and Slovakia you

462
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:05,220
have electronic reporting of

463
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:07,560
transactions one of the reasons why I

464
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,630
like parallel police is because this

465
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,879
doesn't apply in parallel police because

466
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,970
parallel police is boycotting and we do

467
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,460
not send this information

468
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,220
there are also tax telling me cash

469
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:23,730
limits which kind of force you to use

470
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:26,680
bank accounts on transactions for

471
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:29,390
example in my country in Slovakia it's

472
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:32,330
5,000 euros in France it's even less

473
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:36,290
it's 1000 euros so you so you don't you

474
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:40,189
cannot actually legally buy even even

475
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:41,500
more expensive laptop with with cash

476
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:46,640
anymore

477
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:50,300
okay so kyc taxation anti money

478
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,700
laundering and source of funds so this

479
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,680
happens in two stages the first stage is

480
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:58,310
when you're opening your bank account

481
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,170
they want to know where you got your

482
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:04,760
money from how much will you be

483
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:08,060
receiving and where did what is what is

484
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:11,420
the source so so is it the business

485
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:15,080
activity to do any heritage or any other

486
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:18,140
reform also when you receive money and

487
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:23,030
it's anything out of ordinary so

488
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:25,160
anything out of what you expected then

489
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:27,770
they will require some more information

490
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,960
on incoming transactions so many people

491
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,940
think that it's difficult to send money

492
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,250
it is actually more difficult especially

493
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:37,000
in international banking to receive

494
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,940
money so if you receive money they will

495
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,500
in most cases require both invoice and

496
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,430
the contract so they want to see okay

497
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:49,520
this is for services delivered and who

498
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:51,200
is the company they will often for for

499
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,350
larger amounts they will often want to

500
00:25:51,200 --> 00:26:00,590
know even the business profile of of the

501
00:25:54,350 --> 00:26:03,590
party to be sending you the money so the

502
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:07,129
tax information is reported to Tax

503
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:09,040
Office's ml information is reported to

504
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,900
financial police which is a completely

505
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,210
different organization with the same

506
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:19,160
owner which is the state but it's a

507
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:22,420
different organization and they do not

508
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,100
currently at least in European Union

509
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:29,420
cooperate automatically so if you have a

510
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:32,480
bank in Cyprus and you do a suspicious

511
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,910
transaction they will report it to the

512
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,750
financial police of Cyprus even though

513
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:42,710
you are from Czech Republic let's say

514
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:45,260
the problem which is also a feature a

515
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:48,289
little bit but I think it's more more of

516
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:51,769
a problem there are no clear rules so

517
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:54,350
you cannot say okay if I do crypto

518
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:57,769
transaction for 500 euros I'm okay

519
00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:00,559
because that's below limit now if the

520
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:02,720
system of the bank says that this is a

521
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,610
risky transaction then it will get

522
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,019
reported and it can be even a hundred

523
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:11,870
euros so there is no clear criteria and

524
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:14,450
another problem is a few people from the

525
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:17,149
banking sector they told me that the

526
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:19,539
financial police is complaining that the

527
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:24,620
banks are sending too little information

528
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:26,570
so so the problem is that the banks have

529
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:30,229
to over report because they have kind of

530
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:33,950
an informal quota so if a bank is

531
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:36,850
supposed to file 500 reports per year

532
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:39,289
and they don't see any suspicious

533
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,000
transactions then they will need to

534
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:42,830
report some that are not suspicious of

535
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,289
the financial policies happy so this is

536
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:48,408
actually happens to one of the banks

537
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:51,470
that I talked with so you can be

538
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:53,090
reported even though your transaction is

539
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:56,419
perfectly okay they have all

540
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,949
documentation and you just kind of was

541
00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:00,710
picked because they need to fill the

542
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:04,850
quota it's interesting the quota is also

543
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:07,760
not public so so one of the bankers I

544
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,918
was talking to he said that first they

545
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,519
were under reporting so then they said

546
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,919
okay it why why should we be the

547
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,840
police station they're the financial

548
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,970
police let them investigate and they

549
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,740
sent every transaction to the financial

550
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,110
police and they immediately got a call

551
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,460
and said oh why are you spamming us with

552
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:29,000
transactions we don't want so many

553
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:31,279
transactions so he they kind of tried to

554
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,029
see okay so what do you expect is the

555
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:38,450
hundred okay or do you need so just just

556
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:40,490
to have a rough estimate in Slovakia the

557
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,919
number of reported transaction per

558
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,659
country is four thousand approximately

559
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:46,909
four thousand per year so it's not like

560
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:49,639
every your crypto transaction is

561
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:51,049
reported what would happen though is

562
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:53,570
that many transaction

563
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:55,158
goto so they won't be reported but the

564
00:28:53,570 --> 00:29:00,168
bank would just say okay we cannot

565
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:02,330
receive this money also AML doesn't

566
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:05,840
concern only financial institutions so

567
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:08,840
in some countries the law offices real

568
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,059
estate agents and even some some private

569
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,789
companies that two completely unrelated

570
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:17,168
business have to report transactions

571
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:22,369
according to ml so they are required to

572
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:24,289
kind of snitch out on on their customers

573
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:25,999
even if they don't want to I don't know

574
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:28,220
how they're going to enforce it but

575
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:34,009
that's what's happening okay

576
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:36,980
censorship so private companies they

577
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:38,929
might choose not to deal with you if you

578
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,149
go to a bank and they say sorry you're

579
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:43,879
not a good fit for us we don't want your

580
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:46,758
customer that's the right like I also

581
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:49,399
don't do business with anyone who wants

582
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:52,070
to do business with me I I want to know

583
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:54,918
if the project makes sense if if they're

584
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:56,809
trustworthy I check their reputation so

585
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:59,210
it's perfectly okay for any private

586
00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:01,399
institution to say I'm sorry we don't

587
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,909
want to do business with you on the

588
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:08,539
other hand with cash limits the banks

589
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:10,879
require you to do to use the banking

590
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:12,679
infrastructure the financial system

591
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:15,109
infrastructure to do some kind of

592
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:17,600
transactions so for example if no bank

593
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:19,580
wants to do business with me but I want

594
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,549
to buy a house and I have the money in

595
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,379
cash there is no way to legally buy a

596
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:26,450
house because I need a bank account I

597
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:27,559
need a way to send it through the

598
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,999
financial system

599
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:34,249
so in some countries thankfully crypto

600
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,989
is not considered cash for example in

601
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:39,049
Slovakia so I could just send them

602
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:41,539
crypto and I didn't break any law but

603
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:44,809
there's some kind of catch-22 and no one

604
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:46,820
is responsible so governments say we

605
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:49,249
don't want to regulate what private

606
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,830
companies do and then they say okay but

607
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:55,600
you need to use these private companies

608
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:58,070
for certain situations so it's kind of

609
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,320
responsibility diffusion there's no one

610
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:02,720
is really responsible no one can do

611
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,979
anything about this because it's no

612
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,669
one's problem

613
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:10,979
so one kind of censorship is we don't

614
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:13,739
want you as a customer another kind of

615
00:31:10,979 --> 00:31:17,759
censorship is we are not going to let

616
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:23,129
this transaction through so some some

617
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:26,249
cases of censorship the first case is a

618
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:28,228
guy appeared in gossip media with a

619
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:31,739
politically exposed person they were on

620
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:34,919
the same party they they got introduced

621
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:36,979
into the watchlist and no bank wanted to

622
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,710
open the bank account for the guy

623
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:46,200
discussed in Nazi forum by Nazis one of

624
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:47,879
the one of the cases everyone owes

625
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:53,339
WikiLeaks when when the credit card

626
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:55,908
company says we we don't want to process

627
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:58,859
this transaction for this organization

628
00:31:55,909 --> 00:32:01,320
porn sites and gambling sites have

629
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:04,009
problems they're there they have

630
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:07,908
problems because the transactions are

631
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:10,580
they have a high risk of chargebacks a

632
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:15,359
lot of companies that deal with legal

633
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:17,849
pharmaceutical drugs or things like weed

634
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,999
so we dispensaries are in a gray area

635
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:23,489
and it's very difficult for them to to

636
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:25,289
do banking because technically what

637
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:30,019
they're doing according to federal law

638
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:32,820
is illegal so so actually dispensaries

639
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:34,679
deal a lot with cash even though if they

640
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,200
can accept credit cards they still have

641
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:41,309
to somehow convert it to cash to buy the

642
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,849
weed and so on so there's a case of sam

643
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:47,519
harris which is a popular podcaster and

644
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:49,229
pattern decided to censor his

645
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,649
transaction they kicked him out as a

646
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:57,389
customer because the credit card company

647
00:32:52,649 --> 00:33:00,238
requested it so so that's interesting I

648
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:02,728
wanted to compare unbanked people in

649
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:05,399
Europe to unbanked people in Panama so a

650
00:33:02,729 --> 00:33:07,739
lot of people say oh it's a it's very

651
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:11,570
bad that there are a lot of unbanked

652
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:13,769
people so in Panama more than

653
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:16,720
approximately half of the adult

654
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:18,370
population do not have bank accounts

655
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,770
on the other hand it's no problem to

656
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,750
come with a suitcase of cash with US

657
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:25,510
dollars and buy a house because they

658
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,340
don't have cash limits so so it's kind

659
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:31,450
of a very different situation being

660
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:33,850
unbanked in Europe is much much worse

661
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:37,840
than than being unbanked in some

662
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:41,139
countries where it can still use cash so

663
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,030
banning of cash it's according to World

664
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,420
Bank it is something that countries need

665
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:48,730
to adopt in order to introduce negative

666
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,540
interest rates we already have negative

667
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:55,240
interest rates but if they become

668
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,950
negative 3% or something like that every

669
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,860
sane person would say okay I'm not

670
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,270
paying the bank to keep my money in the

671
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,030
bank account I will just withdraw

672
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:06,760
anything put it in the pillow or hide it

673
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:09,850
under the bed and there it's at least

674
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,880
zero not negative three percent so the

675
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:16,089
only way how you can prevent this is you

676
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,679
can say okay there is no cash so either

677
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,300
you have money in a bank account with

678
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,179
negative interest rates or you don't

679
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:25,300
have money so this is an official

680
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:27,220
document of World Bank if if the country

681
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,500
is where to adopt negative interest

682
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:33,189
rates they recommend banning cash

683
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:35,650
completely also cash is anonymous and

684
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:41,770
uncensored all so it's a very nice

685
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:44,020
feature of cash unless you are in in a

686
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:46,989
situation where the transaction is is

687
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,300
illegal so then it's still answerable

688
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:52,149
but also illegal

689
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,880
so there's cash limits also there's this

690
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:57,070
push for cashless society everyone

691
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:01,570
please pay with credit cards and you

692
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:03,460
know pay a few percent fees to the

693
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,520
credit card company so this word is also

694
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:09,190
happening also if you want to pay take

695
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,170
cash over border the usual limit is ten

696
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,650
thousand US dollars so you cannot just

697
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:18,540
you know bring 1 million euros to

698
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:23,980
Switzerland and put it in a bank there

699
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:26,320
so the way to do it is with crypto so

700
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:29,770
the question why who made up these rules

701
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,230
how did this become reality

702
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,690
so the usual answer would be lawmakers

703
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:38,230
of course they make the rules but

704
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:41,349
actually it's a very small fraction of

705
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:43,030
who is making the rules also there are

706
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:45,390
financial institutions they make their

707
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:50,230
own rules because they don't want to be

708
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:52,450
seen as bad actors they want to seem as

709
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,369
a good members of the society so that

710
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:57,939
they themselves introduced and they

711
00:35:54,369 --> 00:36:02,109
self-regulate but the landscape is much

712
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:06,160
wider so of course there is osed that's

713
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:09,460
the invasion of tax reporting common

714
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,279
reporting standard is osed which is this

715
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:14,140
international organization what is the

716
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,740
last known is an organization called

717
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:21,930
called financial action task force or

718
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:26,020
fat McGuffey is the French translation

719
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:28,750
this is a small thing think of maybe

720
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,210
less than ten people sitting in the

721
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:34,599
offices of oacd in Paris so it's a

722
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:36,089
private nonprofit that writes most of

723
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:40,390
international anti money laundering

724
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:45,730
regulations they publish great lists and

725
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:47,589
black lists of countries so this is very

726
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:51,030
interesting because it's a network the

727
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:54,640
enforcement so if you are using

728
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:57,040
international transfers you want to know

729
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,740
that you are dealing with a reliable

730
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,460
partner so so if someone is sending you

731
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:05,229
money to your financial institution the

732
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,970
receiving financial institution would

733
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,270
ask okay what kind of rules do you

734
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:14,259
follow

735
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:17,320
and there are some standards and most if

736
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,930
not all institution follow this

737
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,060
financial action task force rules so

738
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,960
these are recommendations they are not

739
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,540
legally binding

740
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,060
there is no Parliament ever voting for

741
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:31,900
these rules they're enforced because

742
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:34,570
they're enforced by by this industry by

743
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:37,710
spreading through Network effects that

744
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:42,340
is also how USA is exporting their laws

745
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:46,320
so FATCA the tax reporting for

746
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:49,360
Americans is a US law so why should

747
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,540
Slovak Czech Panamanian whatever bank

748
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:59,530
and force these rules it's you know the

749
00:37:52,540 --> 00:38:02,080
the US law the US law is in the u.s. so

750
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:05,560
what they did is they said okay all the

751
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:08,740
financial institutions in u.s. have to

752
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,660
follow these laws and also if they do

753
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:13,359
any transaction with any other

754
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,779
institution there are two options one

755
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:19,000
option is that the corresponding

756
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,250
institution also follows these rules so

757
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,990
they also accept FATCA even though it's

758
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:30,010
outside of US jurisdiction or we will

759
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:32,200
send 30% of every transaction that's

760
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:36,330
done with the institution to the IRS to

761
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:40,569
the American tax office so really any

762
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:44,380
institution any banking institution if

763
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:48,940
they touch America or anyone else that

764
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:51,370
touched America they can either get a

765
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:55,360
cut from the transactions through this

766
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:58,980
network of 30% or they need to accept

767
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:02,080
this rule so it's interesting because no

768
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,780
no members of parliament in slovakia

769
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:09,670
ever voted for or at least not in the

770
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:12,070
beginning of of this this law but they

771
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:14,050
still have to comply right now it's

772
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,210
enforced by bilateral agreements as well

773
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:19,570
so so it's kind of more complex

774
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:23,890
international but but the exporting was

775
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:25,690
very very surprising and very effective

776
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:28,629
actually so I don't know if you have

777
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:30,700
ever feel the FATCA form I don't do any

778
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:34,570
business with America I was not born in

779
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:38,950
America I don't have any relationship to

780
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:43,240
America and I spent a lot of hours in my

781
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:44,189
life filling American tax forms so

782
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,279
that's really interesting

783
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:49,870
I mentioned companies that are creating

784
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,390
the suspect lists and also

785
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:55,078
recommendations there are European Union

786
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:57,359
working groups they often create

787
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:59,009
also only recommendations which are

788
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,058
followed so they don't need to go

789
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:04,410
through the usual process and

790
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:06,150
intermediary and correspondent banks so

791
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,538
it's very interesting

792
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,309
good example would be again Panama so

793
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:13,739
Panama uses US dollar they don't have

794
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:16,619
their own currency so that means that

795
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:19,680
every international transfer from Panama

796
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:23,579
currently goes to an US intermediary

797
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,459
bank there are three big banks that act

798
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:30,329
as intermediary or correspondent banks

799
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:33,899
and they require all Panamanian banks to

800
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:37,469
follow some rules so in Panama no one

801
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:40,529
voted for for these rules they're

802
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:43,709
actually not even explicit but if a

803
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:47,969
Panamanian bank wants to I don't know if

804
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:51,359
a Panamanian wants to buy fertilizer for

805
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:53,999
their field from from abroad they will

806
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,769
have to deal with a request from some US

807
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:57,238
intermediary bank even though if they're

808
00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:59,788
not doing the business with the us

809
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:02,630
directly so that's also interesting so a

810
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:04,890
lot of private and independent

811
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:08,339
institutions that are not controlled by

812
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:11,959
any kind of democratic process make up

813
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:15,660
the international financial rules so

814
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:20,879
it's very nice and easy to complain you

815
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:25,019
know these banks they're evil and and a

816
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:28,140
lot of people for example say that these

817
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:30,390
banks they perceive crypto as a threat

818
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,690
it will destroy them and that is why

819
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:36,299
they why they don't want to deal with

820
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:39,959
crypto so I think the story is much

821
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:41,969
easier the story is if they perceived

822
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:44,368
that this could be a problem and you are

823
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:46,890
a person with a free account that's

824
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:49,410
paying two euros per month in fees and

825
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:51,779
there is a risk that they will have a

826
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:54,359
problem because you're sending money in

827
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:56,759
and out of crypto exchanges and doing

828
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,749
weird stuff they will just say okay this

829
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:59,940
is not worth it

830
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:03,180
the risk is higher than then what we

831
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,430
what we get so we have our big retail

832
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:09,060
business to protect and we don't care

833
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:11,430
about you know 500 weird people that

834
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:15,120
go to Krypton artist conferences so they

835
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:16,470
just say okay it's not worth the risk so

836
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:20,580
again that's the responsibility

837
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:24,720
diffusion the financial institutions are

838
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:29,160
not to blame they're doing all they can

839
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:32,250
to to increase and grow their business

840
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:35,339
and politicians say we didn't make up

841
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:37,770
the rules which you know that's what the

842
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:40,020
banks chose to be to be doing so that's

843
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:41,670
very interesting situation I would like

844
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:45,060
to show you just this slide from a

845
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:47,430
report on corporate surveillance so I

846
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,960
was talking about financial institutions

847
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,660
which are private but the private

848
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,840
financial surveillance landscape is only

849
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:57,029
part of a bigger landscape of

850
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,350
surveillance so these are financial

851
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,660
services but there are a lot of

852
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:03,540
companies there's a lot of

853
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:06,750
specialization about how how these

854
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:09,000
companies are building your profiles how

855
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,400
they're learning about your behavior how

856
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,860
they're DeRay deriving new information

857
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:18,030
from the behavior you can google google

858
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:20,640
it the whole report is online so it's

859
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,040
part of something that's been recently

860
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,100
called surveillance capitalism for

861
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,380
example PayPal shares personal financial

862
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:31,680
information with more than six hundred

863
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,300
third parties I'm not making it up you

864
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,520
can look it up on their website that's

865
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:38,520
the list it's public institutions

866
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,310
private institution risk management's

867
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:45,750
credit rating organizations and so on so

868
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:49,040
next time you buy your stuff with Amazon

869
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:52,920
know that this transaction potentially

870
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,140
sends information to 600 other parties

871
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,870
the problem is of course internet is

872
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:01,790
free so if you're using free service

873
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:04,609
then they need to make money somehow and

874
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:08,810
the surveillance capitalism is not very

875
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:08,810
effective in enforcing

876
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:15,479
compiling this information sharing it

877
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:18,270
and making money out of it so if you are

878
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,250
not paying for a service then you're the

879
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:23,920
product and

880
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,990
the designs cabbage this landscape is

881
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,990
really huge and it's not only about what

882
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:32,529
you do but what what you do says about

883
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:35,439
you so if I go to a website I didn't

884
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:38,140
tell anyone I'm a creep to honor his bat

885
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,090
if they see I read five krypton or his

886
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,560
the articles and then pay for a ticket

887
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:47,170
to Prague doing hackers Congress they

888
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:50,970
safely know that I am so what to do

889
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:54,010
about it first of all you can use crypto

890
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:55,930
instead of bank accounts also you can

891
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:58,690
use services like lamium which allow you

892
00:44:55,930 --> 00:45:01,180
to pay your invoices in a traditional

893
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:05,500
banking without kyc without registration

894
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:08,710
using crypto using Bitcoin please use

895
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,170
non ky6 changes support them there are

896
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,480
many hold huddle and bisque are maybe

897
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:16,840
the most interesting you can use also

898
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:22,120
ATMs here or anywhere else where they

899
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:24,310
still function you do not need to be

900
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,710
exposed to crypto volatility if the

901
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:28,840
volatility of Bitcoin is not your thing

902
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:32,920
there are ways how you can avoid it for

903
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:35,590
example you can enter a short on bit max

904
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:39,310
perpetual swap which will fix your

905
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:41,590
dollar value of your coins and even get

906
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:44,440
paid interest rate which is currently

907
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:47,380
around 10% PA you can keep most of your

908
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:52,300
coins say safely in your hardware wallet

909
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:54,010
so I'm saying this that just because you

910
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,500
want to use crypto doesn't mean you need

911
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:59,890
to you know be okay with all the

912
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,960
volatility you can you can do it this

913
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,819
all hurt surveillance capitalism so

914
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,980
there will be a backlash but please do

915
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:11,380
it pay for stuff free stuff means

916
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:14,740
surveillance pay for good products and

917
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,780
services and if you have a choice to pay

918
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,990
with crypto even if you're a hot ler

919
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:22,570
please pay with crypto you can buy it

920
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:28,149
back the same day but please use crypto

921
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:30,610
to keep your keep your privacy so I'm

922
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:34,119
writing a book about this it's just a

923
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:38,890
template cover if you want to know

924
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:41,170
it's out you can register some address

925
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:43,299
email address even anonymous I don't

926
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:46,509
care and I will send you an email when

927
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:55,059
when the book is out it's maybe 1/3 done

928
00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:57,490
and thank you I'd like to I let you talk

929
00:46:55,059 --> 00:47:00,789
because it's interesting but we have

930
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:02,470
maybe one question or one or two quick

931
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:05,259
questions from the audience

932
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:08,319
sure I'll be also around so if you want

933
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:11,499
to check don't be happy before someone

934
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:14,079
raises their hand I have a few additions

935
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:18,578
to what you were saying the the FATCA

936
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:20,349
rules that are very new like a few few

937
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:24,609
weeks ago they released new set of

938
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:27,789
recommendations that require custodial

939
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:29,759
services in crypto to transmit personal

940
00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:36,069
information together with the

941
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:38,440
transactions so I thought yeah

942
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:40,599
but in any case this is one of the most

943
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,489
crucial and important things that

944
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:44,349
happened and not many media have

945
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:45,910
reported on that could you elaborate a

946
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:48,970
little bit on that

947
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:50,529
well the takeaway is don't use companies

948
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,359
that require your private information

949
00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:54,519
then they will have no private

950
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:56,380
information to pass but the traveler

951
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:59,140
rule means if you're sending money from

952
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:01,119
an exchange that knows who you are at

953
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,220
some other exchange they will also need

954
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,519
to pass the information of who you are

955
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:08,709
to the other other company we don't know

956
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:12,220
how it will be implemented it's just a

957
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:15,999
recommendation anyway but how did we oh

958
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:17,769
yeah there's also I you know you

959
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:19,988
mentioned that they don't want the banks

960
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:21,879
are scared to deal with potentially

961
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:24,970
small customers and getting to trouble

962
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:27,549
because of them I just recently was

963
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:30,910
dealing with someone who has huge

964
00:48:27,549 --> 00:48:32,799
businesses in a particular Bank we're

965
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:35,319
talking you know potentially hundreds of

966
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:38,470
millions of dollars and he also has

967
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:42,160
private account there and he wanted to

968
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:45,930
purchase five million worth of Bitcoin

969
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:48,600
mm-hmm and his bank said no yeah no so

970
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:51,620
it's too and it's also so what is what

971
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:54,870
is interesting that the banks have this

972
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:56,759
small department of account managers and

973
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:59,160
usually much larger Department of Risk

974
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,800
Management and some of the bankers I was

975
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:04,470
talking to they so a clear business case

976
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:07,320
they wanted someone as a customer and a

977
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:09,569
bank clerk in risk Department that's

978
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:12,390
making you know thousand euros per month

979
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:15,450
said no we cannot have this one hundred

980
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:17,819
million worth of money from this

981
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,649
customer because it's no not good enough

982
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,270
for risk and they couldn't push it even

983
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:23,730
through the board so so they're very

984
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:25,200
risk-averse risk risk management

985
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:28,290
department they want to keep their job

986
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,600
so so and it's very easy for them to say

987
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:32,790
no because there are KPIs they don't

988
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:37,110
care if the bank makes money that's

989
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:39,000
right okay is there any question no okay
