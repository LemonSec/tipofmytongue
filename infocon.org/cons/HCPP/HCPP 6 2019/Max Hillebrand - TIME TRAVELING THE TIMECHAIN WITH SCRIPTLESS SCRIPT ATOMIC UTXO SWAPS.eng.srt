[Music]

3
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,948
well let me welcome you to our next talk

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,350
in slave-owner and I'm really happy that

5
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,530
I can introduce our next speaker

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,809
Maxie Lebrun time I hope I pronounced

7
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,350
correctly okay great and I'm really glad

8
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,949
I can introduce max here because Max is

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,059
my good friend we met on hackathon in

10
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:50,610
Bratislava

11
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,839
it was between hackathon in Peru nopales

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,839
and Max is such a cool guy he found a

13
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:59,970
way how to use Bitcoin in such a private

14
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,489
way that it's even more private and more

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,039
narrow yeah it's yeah it's pretty cool

16
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,320
so max is contributed her to many

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,020
open-source project but what is small

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,360
most important possibly wallet so who

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,220
use what's a big wallet here oh I love

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,759
you guys and who didn't raise the hand

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:21,210
is doing a huge mistake and I think max

22
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,619
will will explain why so let me hand

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:34,919
over to our next speaker

24
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:35,999
Max and have fun what's up Pierce thank

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,189
you very much for joining me here today

26
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:40,979
it really is a great honor to speak here

27
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,079
last year was my first year at HTTP and

28
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,149
liber8 was a perfect topic because what

29
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,589
happened in between them and and the

30
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,880
mindset shift that you get after

31
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,819
attending such a great event this is

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,068
truly absolutely liberating and the

33
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,249
topic this year with opt-out it seems to

34
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,780
be even more fitting for me because with

35
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,149
the user activated soft pork and

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,189
especially no 2x it became clear to me

37
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,249
that bitcoin is the real thing

38
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,079
this is a powerful tool to defend your

39
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:09,750
individual sovereignty and to reclaim

40
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,930
your monetary independence and that is

41
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,850
so unbelievable and not just in order to

42
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,600
defend against malicious actors trying

43
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,299
to take over

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,700
but even if we when you're acting

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,319
accordance to consensus to then get the

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,049
upgrades that you want into the protocol

47
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,940
so you ASF and no 2x was this one-two

48
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,580
punch that really proved to me that

49
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,190
bitcoin is a tool that we can use to opt

50
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,190
out and pretty much a day after I

51
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,290
decided to sell all my Fiat backs and it

52
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,549
took me quite a bit to reach that stage

53
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,499
where I'm right now

54
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:42,150
but a couple days ago I quit my bank

55
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:44,879
account I'm completely unbanked now I

56
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:49,769
live only with Bitcoin out of cash thank

57
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,689
you very much and you know it's it's not

58
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,430
just that that you have the con that you

59
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:55,108
hold it but even more important is that

60
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,819
you contribute to this open-source

61
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,049
ecosystem and so when you are at that

62
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,268
point where you can actually earn

63
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:02,639
satoshis by providing a valuable service

64
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,280
to other peers in your network in your

65
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,230
local Agora that is absolutely powerful

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,180
and then especially when you use these

67
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,738
earn satoshis and you spent them again

68
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,389
on the goods and services that you would

69
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,040
like to consume or that you need in

70
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,730
order to produce something for your

71
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,679
clients so we we are at this point where

72
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,319
we truly have this opportunity to opt

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,379
out to be unbanked and to say you

74
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,000
to the Fiat system and of slavery and to

75
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,429
live in a voluntary Agora

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,310
and I think here at parallel police with

77
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,500
this permanent autonomous zone we have a

78
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,480
beacon of hope here in Prague that is

79
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,639
absolutely stellar and to see all these

80
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,018
beautiful free minds here attending and

81
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,949
all the conversations that we can have

82
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,780
is really something and so you know as

83
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:47,729
as he said here with one of the projects

84
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,489
that I that I contribute to is what sabe

85
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:52,859
wallet and that is mainly because over

86
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:55,439
the years I noticed that while bitcoin

87
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:58,079
is a beautiful monetary experiment or a

88
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,418
very successful one but it is lacking on

89
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,819
several very important vitally important

90
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,560
privacy functions because here again

91
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,328
with the OODA loop when you can be

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,639
attributed to your actions then you

93
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,340
can't be censored and that is not good

94
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,069
and we need to fix that and I do believe

95
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,840
that we can fix this with Bitcoin and I

96
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,699
know here for example with XM art or two

97
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,099
or many Mineiro maximalists here in the

98
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,770
crowd you see that as well right you see

99
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:25,080
that there are huge privacy risks with

100
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,400
using digital currencies and that we

101
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,949
truly need to fix that

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,859
and whenever well it's definitely a very

103
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:34,409
novel solution and in my opinion it's by

104
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,090
far the most awesome coin it still

105
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:38,130
is a shake on because well it's worse

106
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,599
than Bitcoin and that is me speaking as

107
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,699
an economist right Austrian economics

108
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:43,349
monetary good I have huge networks

109
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,509
effects and for me especially the

110
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:48,060
ability of keeping consensus and staying

111
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:50,550
in consensus as we did with VOA SF is

112
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,020
unbelievably powerful so with me being

113
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,450
economists at four

114
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,099
Becan is absolutely exciting and then

115
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,510
ever since I fell down that rabbit hole

116
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,510
becoming more and more of a cyberpunk

117
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,610
privacy extremist I really need to make

118
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,440
sure that we have this monetary tool

119
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,540
that is so powerful economically

120
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,700
speaking and that we can use this to

121
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,160
further defend ourselves not just to

122
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,650
defend ourselves against inflation but

123
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,390
against direct theft and here of course

124
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:21,030
privacy is is key so what do we have

125
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,969
right now right Bitcoin is based on a UT

126
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,039
EXO model and that is vitally vitally

127
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,200
important to understand if you do not

128
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,480
understand UT EXO is then it's pretty

129
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,750
damn difficult to figure out how to stay

130
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,330
private in such a system and so this

131
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,240
means basically you have a coin a

132
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,090
Bitcoin quite literally and this coin is

133
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,280
scarce meaning one UT axial one unspent

134
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,310
transaction output is locked up by a

135
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,229
Bitcoin script write a legal contract

136
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,590
that defines the property rights over

137
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,450
who can spend that one single coin and

138
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,390
you know most in most cases that is

139
00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:00,090
simply a public key right a huge random

140
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,099
large number that has been derived from

141
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:06,060
the private key over the elliptical

142
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:08,669
curve magic and with this commitment on

143
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,590
who can spend that key only he who has

144
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,270
the knowledge of the private key and can

145
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,909
prove that knowledge with a valid

146
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,400
cryptographic signature and this

147
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,110
signature part has to be added to the

148
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,090
transaction right so you have the input

149
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,790
which coin is being spent and then you

150
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,590
have a proof over are the person trying

151
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,990
to spend that coin does he actually have

152
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,229
knowledge of the private key and if yes

153
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,140
then this is a spendable output so a

154
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:36,330
spendable input of this transaction and

155
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,800
then the next question is what to do

156
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,830
with that money right if you have let's

157
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,340
say 5 million Satoshi's in that uth so

158
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,080
what happens now like the one individual

159
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,510
who was able to spend it with knowledge

160
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,159
of the private key did spend it but who

161
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,990
is the next one who can spend it right

162
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,850
and that is the output of the

163
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,860
transaction and here we can have several

164
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,320
right we can have let's say one output

165
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,510
that goes to Alice's public key another

166
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,669
output that goes to Bob's public key and

167
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,110
we can have even more elaborate scripts

168
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,870
for example multi signatures

169
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,789
or maybe time logs right there are many

170
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,180
ways that we can define the Bitcoin

171
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:16,419
scripting a property rights rule in

172
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,479
order to well again define who can spend

173
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:22,000
that new output and this is basically

174
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:24,008
how the utx olsat model works you can

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,479
spend the entire coin and only the

176
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,250
entire coin right now it's not an

177
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,900
account based model and like other shake

178
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,900
hands like aetherium for example by the

179
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,520
way horrible for privacy and then you

180
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,280
know you spent the entire coin and you

181
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,740
create new outputs that commit to who

182
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,198
can spend that coin right and let's say

183
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,900
for the very basics most of the time

184
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,060
that we have one input right that has

185
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,650
one public key committed and that has

186
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,870
the signature or the witness program

187
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,628
that proves that you can spend that coin

188
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,360
and then we have another output that is

189
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:56,800
again one single public key and only the

190
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,740
person with knowledge of the private key

191
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,620
can spend that coin and in this very

192
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,710
basic model we could say that inputs pay

193
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,090
outputs right and you know that is

194
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,529
usually how we think of of Ekron

195
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,568
transactions you have a coin you sign

196
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,400
your transaction and then you know you

197
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:15,460
pay someone else maybe you get some

198
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,190
change back in a new you TX oh well that

199
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,979
that is true for most cases but that's

200
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:24,909
not actually how it has to be right and

201
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:27,310
I would say that we this this assumption

202
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:30,279
that inputs pay outputs is one of the

203
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,559
most devastating privacy leaks that we

204
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,049
have right if I have a again five

205
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,630
million Satoshi UTI Excel and I pay you

206
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,659
for the coffee and I get my change back

207
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,909
there is a clear transaction history

208
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:45,699
that I give you some money right and

209
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,470
that is attribution to an act and it's

210
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:50,380
very clear it's very transparent and

211
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,209
everyone verifies it literally everyone

212
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,260
I mean if you're running a full node by

213
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:57,219
the way who we are is running a full

214
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:59,550
node Oh fantastic the follow question

215
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,290
here is running a novel specifically

216
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:05,439
okay couple okay let's get the tribe is

217
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,149
growing then you know everyone here is

218
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,440
verifying that the witness program is

219
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:11,380
correct and that the input is actually

220
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,470
unspent and then that the output here is

221
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,779
sent as well so this is a full

222
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,230
attribution of pretty much the entire

223
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:21,890
economic transaction

224
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,420
and we can kind of obfuscate that with

225
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,850
something for example like a coin join

226
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,770
and what happens here there are many

227
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,230
different nuances in the implementation

228
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,000
and for example wasabi wallet has one

229
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,580
type of these implementation of a zero

230
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,700
link coin join a Tommy inclined join and

231
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,160
here we collect several inputs by many

232
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,520
different individual peers in one giant

233
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,410
transaction and then we have the outputs

234
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,300
of this giant transactions with many

235
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,540
hundreds of inputs then we generate

236
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,030
equal value outputs right and these

237
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,219
equal value outputs are again to the

238
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,949
public key of the individual who has

239
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,960
also provided the input so basically you

240
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:03,230
send money to yourself and you have the

241
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,270
input and you join your coin quite

242
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,040
literally with all the many other peers

243
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,199
in that transaction and then you

244
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,660
generate in that huge transactions with

245
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,360
many many outputs one output that again

246
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,069
belongs to you and with this all of a

247
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,690
sudden it's no longer clear exactly

248
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:22,040
which input pays which output right

249
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,510
because we have many inputs and many

250
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,339
outputs and especially when they are

251
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,770
with equal denominations on the output

252
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,020
side it becomes very very difficult to

253
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,720
link these inputs to outputs

254
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,449
who pays whom and that is already a

255
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,890
fantastic privacy improvement because

256
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,100
now all the attribution over who pays

257
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:42,260
whom does no longer exist or at least to

258
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,940
a much more obvious gated way right

259
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,590
there are of course is always user

260
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,090
errors that you can do that can lead to

261
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,090
your D anonymization where you can then

262
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:52,400
figure out this was your output or your

263
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,840
u TX o before the coin join and here

264
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,209
after the coin join this is yours again

265
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,260
for example if you consolidate a lot of

266
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:02,210
these a u TX all of your coin join and

267
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,360
this is one very powerful technique and

268
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,250
we've been doing Congo instance or

269
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,570
2012-13 probably and we've gone better

270
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,410
and better and better and for example

271
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,120
with these shaumyan coin joints we have

272
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,620
great great privacy improvements in a

273
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,380
way that you don't even have to trust

274
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,270
the central coordinator of such a huge

275
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,220
conjoint transaction which is awesome

276
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,500
because then this individual who does or

277
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,870
company who does this coordination of

278
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,820
the coin joint cannot steal and cannot

279
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,010
spy from you right because he does not

280
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,000
know your extended public key he cannot

281
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,160
link your inputs

282
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,840
two outputs and with a bunch of snore

283
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,180
blind signature magic happening here as

284
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,770
well and again that that would be wasabi

285
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,380
wallet a bunch more information on that

286
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,240
is that Doc's taught wasabi volatile but

287
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,600
that is not necessarily the part of this

288
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,520
talk here today because the somewhat of

289
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,860
a problem or the downside of having coin

290
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,930
joints is that you have inputs and the

291
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,300
outputs and you still have one

292
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,219
individual paying either himself in the

293
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,530
way that it is set up right now or we

294
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,850
can use some more communication magic

295
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:07,550
where Ella's pays Bob and it's still

296
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:10,490
though a that the inputs pay the output

297
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:12,170
of that one transaction so here you

298
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,120
still know that when Alice is

299
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,160
registering hurricanes in the input

300
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,020
section of the conjoint transaction that

301
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,260
she does something with these outputs

302
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,329
and most likely they go back to her so

303
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,520
this still decreases our anonymity set

304
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:29,180
and it locks us within this one

305
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:31,730
transaction I mean and I think that we

306
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,250
can do much much better and we can do so

307
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:37,100
with something called atomic swaps now

308
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,570
when when I say atomic swamps most of

309
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,550
you look at it's like oh coin

310
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,710
gambling right you change your precious

311
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,569
Bitcoin and you get some other random

312
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,160
stuff on some other chain and it's

313
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:49,160
atomically so nobody can steal from you

314
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,290
yeah I mean cool that is very very nice

315
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,490
novel feature but honestly I really

316
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,810
don't care much about your coins I

317
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,720
really care about my privacy of my

318
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,760
Satoshi's and so instead of swapping

319
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,850
Bitcoin for shake ones what we are

320
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:05,150
swapping is one Bitcoin UT AK soul for

321
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,310
another pick on UT XL and not within the

322
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,980
same transaction but within different

323
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,780
transactions in the time chain or well

324
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,490
after a long conversation with Peter

325
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,350
Todd I should actually say time space

326
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,150
chain but that's the complete other

327
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,490
whole thing there is a well crypto

328
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,199
network interview with Peter that we did

329
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,790
downstairs in the fishbowl where we

330
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,830
talked a lot about the time space chain

331
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,130
it definitely is something so check that

332
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:30,550
out so the cool thing though with atomic

333
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:33,770
swaps here is that we fundamentally

334
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:36,740
break the assumption of chain anal spice

335
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:39,380
that inputs pay outputs and that is the

336
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,260
very very major assumption that we are

337
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,790
currently all making and the way that we

338
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,790
do it is is actually quite normal

339
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,399
let's say we we can do this stuff

340
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:53,248
already with something called hashed

341
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,999
time locked contracts no any of you

342
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:58,470
running a lightning Network note

343
00:13:55,999 --> 00:14:00,420
fantastic then all of you are using hash

344
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,829
time lock contracts already to route

345
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,019
your payment's throughout the Lightning

346
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:06,930
Network and basically what this

347
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:09,540
functionality does is that you commit to

348
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,719
a secret and you do that by hashing the

349
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,939
secret and then you set up a Bitcoin

350
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,550
script spending condition that says that

351
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:20,699
if I reveal the secret something happens

352
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:23,849
and then eventually after you've set up

353
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:26,279
this hash on the time chain or off chain

354
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:30,509
you can then reveal the secret and

355
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:32,399
something happens and this this aspect

356
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:34,319
of committing to a secret doing

357
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,550
something with that and then revealing

358
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:41,339
the secret that is the basic model of

359
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:43,199
atomic swaps as well though the problem

360
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:46,709
is specifically with hashed time lock

361
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,870
contracts is that we have a hash on the

362
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:51,359
time chain and this hash can clearly be

363
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:54,540
distinguished from any other public key

364
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,579
or signature and thus this means that we

365
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,680
can again attribute that something is

366
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,719
happening here right it's not just a

367
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,628
regular public key and signature it's a

368
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,250
hash and a pre-image and so there is

369
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:08,519
something going on maybe a lightning

370
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:12,269
Network hdl-c or an atomic swap so with

371
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:14,699
using HDL seas we reveal unnecessary

372
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:16,379
information and that decreases our

373
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:18,750
anonymity sat in the sense that not

374
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:21,029
everyone is using HDL seas and so when

375
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,250
we are using HDL ceased and this reveals

376
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:27,000
that we are part of a smaller group the

377
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:29,189
Serenity set a smaller and there has

378
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,959
been for a long time now on you know all

379
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:33,209
the Bitcoin research forums the

380
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,489
discussions about tap root which is the

381
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:39,449
implementation of zakat version one

382
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:42,149
Shanor signature schemes and know that

383
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:43,920
in and of itself is just enough grade of

384
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,470
the sacred version from z version 0 to

385
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,969
version 1 right just how by how awesome

386
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,569
sequitur actually is and how it is

387
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,879
implemented

388
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,709
and it just changes the signature scheme

389
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,559
right from using ECDSA

390
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:57,839
to using nor signatures so no signatures

391
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:58,769
actually came before ECDSA that was back

392
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,839
in 1983 years

393
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:03,660
something and it's a very simple very

394
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,300
very very simple signature scheme that

395
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,860
uses some cryptographic magic in order

396
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,779
to prove knowledge of a private key

397
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,850
without actually revealing that private

398
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,160
key that's what a signature does well

399
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,600
the Schnoor professor from unique kind

400
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,149
of an asshole and he thought that he had

401
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,489
ownership over a math formula as though

402
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:22,319
he laid a patent on that and nobody was

403
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:23,699
allowed to use it or if they did that

404
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:26,519
the government would started shooting at

405
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:28,498
them so well a Satoshi unfortunately

406
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,819
could not really use this signature

407
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:31,769
scheme when he was creating Bitcoin

408
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:33,540
because well nobody was really using it

409
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:36,209
because they were prohibited by violence

410
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,230
from using a math formula well now that

411
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:38,638
the patent is expired

412
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,709
well the story asshole is still around

413
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,529
but at least he no longer can enforce

414
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:45,988
his claims then now we can use this

415
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:48,209
actually to build a more robust system

416
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:50,160
with the signature scheme so not only do

417
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:52,410
we have cryptographic proof that the

418
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,809
signature scheme actually works and that

419
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,449
it is in the discrete log realm which we

420
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:59,910
do not have a beautiful proof for ECDSA

421
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:02,279
actually so we have more risk with ECDSA

422
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,500
but even more than just having a nice

423
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:07,500
proof that this is secure is that noise

424
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,720
signatures are linear and that we can do

425
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,760
a bunch of awesome stuff because they

426
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,069
are just so much simpler it's it's a

427
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,169
simpler Lego block and we can build more

428
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:18,779
awesome things with simple tools right

429
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:21,419
keep it simple stupid and this means

430
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:24,388
that we can do for example multi

431
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:27,149
signatures we're not in a way of using

432
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:29,070
the Bitcoin peers to verify that here

433
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:30,899
are three public keys and you need two

434
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,850
signatures of either of these three

435
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:34,709
public keys in order to spend that coin

436
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,850
that is how current multi signatures

437
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:41,480
work which nor we can actually aggregate

438
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:44,639
three public keys into one public key

439
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,919
with some cryptographic magic and then

440
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:50,549
you can only provide a valid signature

441
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,389
to this aggregated public key if you a

442
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:53,730
great

443
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:58,229
two out of three individual signatures

444
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:00,480
of the individual private keys so we no

445
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,250
longer have three public keys but we

446
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,990
aggregate them to one and we no longer

447
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,330
have two signatures but we also

448
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,880
aggregate them to one so all of a sudden

449
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,830
it looks like one single public key one

450
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,470
single signature and again we would

451
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,980
assume that this is just a list

452
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,750
her single key coin however actually

453
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,880
it's Alice Bob and Charlie now

454
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,549
collaborating together to spend that

455
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,130
money for something and this again

456
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:26,480
removes unnecessary information right we

457
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,190
don't need to know who is actually

458
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,049
signing these transactions as long as

459
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,630
the signatures valid everything is fine

460
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:36,830
that's all the full note verifies and

461
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:38,030
with music this is just one of the

462
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,908
awesome things that we can do with

463
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,950
taproot and that is awesome I wrote my

464
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:45,470
bachelor thesis about this but what I

465
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,840
think is infinitely more awesome is

466
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,330
something called adapter signatures that

467
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,030
utilizes script lists script as is in

468
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,428
the title and what is a script well

469
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:58,908
again it is a specific set of Bitcoin

470
00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:01,940
code that defines the property rights of

471
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:04,070
ownership of a UT Excel and with a

472
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,870
script Allah script we can have some

473
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,260
functionalities of scripts without

474
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:11,178
actually utilizing a script so we're not

475
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:14,539
using for example a script of a hash

476
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:17,450
time-lock contract we only use public

477
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:20,960
keys and signatures but we can have the

478
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,120
same effect as in hdl-c has we commit to

479
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,370
a secret we do something with that

480
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,010
commitment and then we reveal the secret

481
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:30,620
and something happens it's the exact

482
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,840
same formula as we already use again

483
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,989
enlightening or you know for atomic

484
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,049
swaps already but in a way that it is

485
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:41,780
indistinguishable from utilizing a

486
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:43,520
regular public key and signature just by

487
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,889
analyst spending her coin on her own and

488
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,629
it's also indistinguishable from Alice

489
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:51,620
Bob and Charlie spending their coin

490
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:54,409
together in a two or three music and now

491
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,510
what can we do when we all of a sudden

492
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:58,220
can commit to a secret and do something

493
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,250
with that commitment reveal the secret

494
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,960
and do something with that revelation

495
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,850
without anyone knowing that this is

496
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,340
actually happening it is

497
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:12,020
indistinguishable from any other private

498
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:15,559
public key signature so with this

499
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,990
basically we have a situation where

500
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,970
Alice owns a Bitcoin you take so let's

501
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:24,620
say 1 million Satoshi's in that you TXO

502
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,630
and Bob has a another 1 million you txl

503
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,620
Bitcoin

504
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:31,540
that they now want to exchange it's not

505
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,830
that Ellis wants to pay Bob it's not

506
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,200
that Bob wants to pay Alice

507
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,870
it's that Ellis wants to get the coin of

508
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,870
Bob and Bob wants to get the coin of

509
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:44,949
else so they're kind of exchanging gold

510
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:48,669
coins basically right and we can do this

511
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:52,510
by well first starting out with a

512
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:56,140
commitment set up where Alice sends her

513
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:59,260
coin into a multi signature a script

514
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,660
that utilizes adapter signatures where

515
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,629
either Alice and Bob can spend that

516
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:07,330
together or after a time out

517
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:10,840
Bob Ellis can get back that coin again

518
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:13,389
to her so with this knowledge already in

519
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,510
this new UTX all being created in the

520
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:20,170
first set of transaction Bob knows that

521
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:23,410
he can get access to this coin but only

522
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:27,430
with the revelation of a secret by Alice

523
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:30,700
and Bob can verify that so he see he

524
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:34,930
knows if I or I can get that coin if

525
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:37,540
Alice reveals some secret to me and now

526
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:40,660
that bob has this proof on the Bitcoin

527
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:43,270
time chain he can send his coin into

528
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,690
another script that is again just a

529
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:49,570
public key that says that Alice can get

530
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:54,100
this coin but only if she reveals her

531
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:55,750
secret and now what can both do

532
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,340
Bob cannot spend the first coin alone

533
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,700
because he does not yet have the secret

534
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:03,220
but Ellis can spend the coin that Bob

535
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,130
just put into that output of the second

536
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:10,270
transaction but only when revealing the

537
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:14,260
secret that unlocks for Bob that coin in

538
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:17,440
the first transaction and that is

539
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,480
basically then it Ellis can spend that

540
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,940
coin but only by revealing the secret

541
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,910
which means then that Bob can claim the

542
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,610
coin of the first transaction so maybe

543
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:30,520
to recap a bit we have two transactions

544
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:33,459
on the time chain the first one is from

545
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:37,629
Ellis a single public key regular

546
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,610
Bitcoin to this multi six cream that she

547
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,200
that Bob can claim but

548
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,178
only with the knowledge of the secret

549
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,299
from Alice and that is the first set of

550
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:49,080
transaction now from a chain anal spy

551
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:51,610
perspective it's just Alice's public key

552
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,010
spending with the signature into another

553
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,928
single public key nothing much happening

554
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,660
just one input one output one pop key

555
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,730
one signature nothing much just like any

556
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:04,059
other regular whole coin sent might be a

557
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:06,429
change output as well and then sometime

558
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:09,730
later maybe let's say five thousand

559
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:12,130
blocks later Bob sends his coin again a

560
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:15,120
single public key and signature into

561
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:17,740
that new script that Alice can claim and

562
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,979
that script is again only a public key

563
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:24,400
and Ellis can spend that second

564
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,950
transaction output by simply doing a

565
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,830
regular signature that reveals with this

566
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,049
adapter signature mathematical trick the

567
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:36,879
secret that Bob needs in order to claim

568
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:38,559
that first transaction you txl and this

569
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,120
is here where the title of time

570
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,100
traveling the time chain actually comes

571
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,989
in because that is actually what we're

572
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,678
happening right we have the set of

573
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:50,830
transaction here and we fund that for

574
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,010
Alice's coin then some time later a

575
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:57,399
couple of blocks Bob does the same right

576
00:23:54,010 --> 00:24:01,390
he sends his coin into this UT axle and

577
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,309
ultimately after a while can be 5,000

578
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,490
blocks can be the next happening can be

579
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,760
until the year 2000 141 really doesn't

580
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,820
matter

581
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:13,030
eventually Ellis will take that second

582
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:17,559
coin and buy her taking that coin Bob

583
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:21,460
can take the first code so Ellis has the

584
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:24,809
input of the transaction one but she

585
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:29,320
gets the output of the transaction - and

586
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:31,840
Bob as the input of transaction - but

587
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:36,070
his time traveling to get the output in

588
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,918
transaction one and all of a sudden with

589
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:41,320
this simple trick we break the

590
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:45,460
assumption that in one transaction the

591
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:48,309
inputs pay the outputs and this

592
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,980
assumption is broken not just for anyone

593
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:53,790
utilizing script the script but for

594
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,860
anyone utilizing taproot

595
00:24:53,790 --> 00:25:00,129
either a taproot single key either a

596
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,469
taproot music or a taproot lightning

597
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:06,010
cooperative close or a taproot channel

598
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:08,380
factory opening or a taproot world state

599
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:10,180
chain funding or a tab road Akash

600
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,030
funding or whatever other magic we can

601
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:15,280
do with Sackville version one tap root

602
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:17,860
anyone who utilizes the signature scheme

603
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,670
all of a sudden has plausible

604
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:26,439
deniability that he could potentially

605
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:29,350
have done it atomic swamp and thus

606
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,900
anyone all of a sudden is free from the

607
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:35,429
transaction graph of inputs pay output

608
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:38,410
and that is absolutely mind-blowing

609
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:40,900
because now we can still verify that

610
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:43,030
there is a solid chain of digital

611
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,860
signatures all the way from the Genesis

612
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:48,129
block or coinbase transaction to the

613
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:50,580
most recent UT EXO and that chain is not

614
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:54,190
broken and it's all valid signatures

615
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:56,860
however these chains of signatures no

616
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:01,360
longer correspond to change of ownership

617
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:04,360
of these UT axles and all of a sudden we

618
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,040
have plausible deniability of where you

619
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,659
are spending your money because from the

620
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,520
outside it just looks like you're

621
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,990
sending to a public key that might be

622
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,910
yours it might be a hardware wallet for

623
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,620
a you know cold storage or something or

624
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,960
it might you buy buying something on bit

625
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,239
refill or whatever it really doesn't

626
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,800
matter it could be anything but actually

627
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,050
this is not even your output that you

628
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,950
create you get that output a couple of

629
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:28,570
thousand blocks later

630
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:30,820
and with this we break the biggest

631
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,669
privacy problem Vikram that is that

632
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:36,159
inputs can be linked to outputs and when

633
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:42,640
we have that and we will very soon

634
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:45,960
hopefully two weeks then I would say we

635
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,300
have pretty damn good privacy in Bitcoin

636
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,500
so I've already said like a bunch of

637
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,480
stuff and I'm sure you have many many

638
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,880
questions so I would like to you know

639
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,710
open this up already to questions so if

640
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:02,600
you have any please hand up and ask so

641
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:06,200
the cool thing though is with

642
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,539
with these with this magic right it's

643
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,450
simpler it's more secure

644
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:14,059
we have cryptographic proofs we have

645
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,279
plausible deniability and we can do much

646
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:18,350
more than just music we're much more

647
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:21,799
than just correctly script we can do a

648
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,990
bunch of things and this is not the

649
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:26,740
magic pill that solves everything but

650
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:29,870
it's one part of the puzzle piece that

651
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:33,500
builds our huge privacy defense tools

652
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:35,779
and Bitcoin so for example let's assume

653
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,090
you have I know you you went to Khan

654
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,740
base and you completely Docs to yourself

655
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,970
by showing your government ID and you

656
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,580
begged for permission to stack your

657
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:45,169
stats which by the way shouldn't but you

658
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,480
did that and now your coin is tainted

659
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:49,399
with your identity right that's not good

660
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,240
you can be attributed to whatever you do

661
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:56,029
with that money then you spent that with

662
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,830
a single signature into some output and

663
00:27:56,029 --> 00:28:00,529
everyone would assume oh you've just

664
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:04,250
spent that kyc coin and you got that

665
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:07,370
output now but no actually you did an

666
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:10,549
atomic swamp not just to another random

667
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:13,100
transaction but actually to a huge zero

668
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:16,399
link coins oh so all of a sudden you

669
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:18,230
have this input right here and you get

670
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,750
this output which is an equal

671
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,759
denomination output amongst hundreds of

672
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,820
other outputs that are all the equal

673
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:27,950
denomination so nobody knows that you

674
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:31,220
actually did that coin joint you just

675
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,539
did a single pop key spent but you did

676
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,580
not spend the money to yourself in that

677
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:36,559
one transaction you spend it to yourself

678
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,830
a couple thousand blocks later in that

679
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,440
coin drive but then what happens when

680
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:43,939
you spent the coin during output it's

681
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,830
just another single public key and

682
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,330
another regular single signature is

683
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:50,360
spending into another single public key

684
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:53,750
well but actually this is another atomic

685
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:56,719
swap but this time it funds a lightning

686
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:58,639
channel Factory which is a huge coin

687
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,529
drawing opening ahead provides you

688
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:02,120
access to sending zeroconf

689
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:06,139
transactions over the Lightning Network

690
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,879
very privately and all of a sudden you

691
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:09,949
with two transactions you completely

692
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,750
broke the link on the time Jane and now

693
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,879
you have access to utilize your coin off

694
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,740
chain without leaving any unchanged

695
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:18,199
footprints but

696
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,090
do you do with that funding in lighting

697
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,590
well of course you could do some routing

698
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,959
across the network

699
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:27,470
to ultimately then land at a II care

700
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:30,230
server and well then use your Akash

701
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:33,590
tokens in order to spend your coffee or

702
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:36,350
whatever and you do that all without

703
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:38,750
revealing that we actually did it and

704
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,639
there's no attribution that you use a

705
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,559
coin joint that you were funding that

706
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,530
lightning channel factory or that you

707
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,600
are sending to the DK server all these

708
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:50,780
assumptions are broken completely

709
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:55,449
obliterated and nobody from the outset

710
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:55,450
can attribute these actions to you

711
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,150
questions so far still none okay I can

712
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:10,189
give you mica from it if you have

713
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:13,490
question isn't it worse then when I

714
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,770
attributed myself to a conjoint I do a

715
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:20,660
transaction that is not known to be a

716
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:23,600
conjoint and that amount ends in

717
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:26,270
somebody's hands eventually and he does

718
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,129
something I don't like with it and I can

719
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:31,490
be attributed to it because I didn't

720
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:34,790
reveal the coin joint if I did I would

721
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:37,970
have better position to deny the action

722
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:40,639
I guess very good point right because

723
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,920
you are swapping UT axles this means you

724
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,929
have your kyc coin over here and you get

725
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:48,260
your coin Joanne output over there but

726
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:50,600
Bob gets your clay y si coin from the

727
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,580
input into his output and now what does

728
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,469
Bob do with this output I mean if he

729
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,389
goes to Silk Road and is active in the

730
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,820
Agora of the second wall then yeah you

731
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:00,790
might be attributed to his actions but

732
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:04,669
again you have plausible deniability

733
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:08,110
right this could be you it could be Bob

734
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:13,640
it could be Charley could be anyone and

735
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:14,959
ultimately does it matter like if when

736
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,730
we're all just doing coin swaps and

737
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,020
we're all doing fine joints and we all

738
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:21,970
make sure that we have these privacy

739
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:24,950
tools available it's it's pretty over

740
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:27,080
you you and the cool thing is you can

741
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,460
always after the fact prove that you

742
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,179
actually do have ownership of that

743
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,180
second

744
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,040
and that you did partake in this atomic

745
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,840
swap and in the coin job but you can do

746
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,850
that with a signature by just revealing

747
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,100
for example the adapter of this scheme

748
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,439
no just a random number that you have to

749
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:45,230
leak you can always do that you can

750
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,300
always claim ownership and you can

751
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,640
always voluntarily opt in to be

752
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:52,909
attributed to this transaction know for

753
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:56,710
example if pump goes to Silk Road but if

754
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,710
you don't want to you don't have to

755
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:05,420
don't you consider their Bitcoin should

756
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:16,610
be private on the core level well if

757
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:20,480
this it is maybe some things don't

758
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:22,699
understand 100% but I still will have

759
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,850
some questions afterwards to please come

760
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,850
up here

761
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,180
so what needs to be changed in Bitcoin

762
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,000
to make this possible and how likely is

763
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,540
it to change in European very good

764
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,120
question

765
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:45,960
this is all included in the taproot

766
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:49,020
second one software proposal so the

767
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,480
taproot defines how exactly we can use

768
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,639
these adapter signatures and other

769
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,110
tricks you know to hide a lot of

770
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,820
information in one single public key

771
00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:00,600
that is indistinguishable from any other

772
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:04,020
regular single public key optional then

773
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,469
we have tab script which defines a new

774
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:09,840
scripting logic in that that utilizes

775
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:13,500
these these cryptographic tricks and

776
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,480
then we have the bib Noor and this just

777
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,300
defines how we use to Shenoy signature

778
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,490
scheme and what exact math formula it is

779
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,110
so these are three bibs authored by

780
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:25,440
Peter wooly and bunch of other awesome

781
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:28,199
contributors and we all get that with

782
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,770
the taproot soft fork now how will that

783
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,870
look

784
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:32,250
well since I'm the CEO of Bitcoin and I

785
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:37,949
can clearly tell you that and the

786
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:39,720
roadmap is two weeks so I mean pretty

787
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,810
much everyone like who's interested in

788
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,120
this sees that taproot is a net benefit

789
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:47,700
improvement to Bitcoin so it should not

790
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,189
be controversial but so it should have

791
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,190
been sacred and we fought many years of

792
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:55,740
war in order to get that activated this

793
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:58,410
brings unbelievable privacy tools to

794
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,360
VidCon there are many individuals who do

795
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,490
not you who do not want you to have

796
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,260
privacy and there will be many

797
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,290
individuals who do everything that they

798
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:10,710
possibly can to block that activation of

799
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:12,509
this powerful tool well yeah they will

800
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,310
do that but what I can claim here is

801
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:17,190
that I will do everything that I can in

802
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:18,480
my power to get Vasavi wallet tap root

803
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,210
version or psycho Division one

804
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,880
compatible the day of activation because

805
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:26,190
the sooner we start using tap root v1

806
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,720
pub keys and signatures the sooner we

807
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,150
have the plausible deniability

808
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,980
so I will do everything that I can to

809
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:34,139
get this activated as soon as possible I

810
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,480
for sure will run the code on my own

811
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:42,418
full note of course after I verified it

812
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,750
and when well two weeks how I I don't

813
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:47,750
know

814
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:50,300
maybe another you ASF I mean this time

815
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,940
there's no ASIC boost stuff so miners

816
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,550
hopefully don't bother about that and so

817
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,599
much there were other soft Forks already

818
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,260
in pick one that were not as

819
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,670
controversial as ecwid was so we'll see

820
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,710
I don't even think that there is yet

821
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:06,109
discussions on how exactly it should be

822
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,780
activated but it will be a soft fork it

823
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:11,058
is backwards compatible it is on the

824
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,339
co-pays rather simple because it's just

825
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:15,380
a incremental update of the sextet

826
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:17,720
versioning program from version zero

827
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,369
which is currently just the regular old

828
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,709
sequitur that we use now with ECDSA

829
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:23,839
to version 1 which will be tampered and

830
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:27,589
because just the way that sackbut is

831
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:32,000
designed this is rather easy to do again

832
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:33,710
nothing in Bitcoin really is easy not

833
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,130
sure if I understood everything that you

834
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:39,920
said but does that impact the way that

835
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,960
you backup something so like for example

836
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:47,150
in the the normal assumption that

837
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:49,790
outputs pay inputs you you have an HD

838
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,770
wallet that the master private key just

839
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:53,720
generates all the other stuff do you

840
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:56,589
need to keep track also of all the the

841
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:01,209
pre images or are they generated by the

842
00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:08,480
master well that's a very good question

843
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:10,790
I mean so is it so you have so what you

844
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,230
use for this adapter it's just another

845
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:17,930
random number T in the math formula and

846
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:20,089
III would presume that you can use a

847
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,669
random number based on the HD scheme a

848
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:24,859
regular deterministic wallet scheme I

849
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,230
don't know I don't know how it will be

850
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:29,509
implemented but the cool thing is it's

851
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,790
it's no longer a pre image and hash but

852
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,670
it is a pape key or private key and a

853
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:38,170
pup key so it's much easier to backup

854
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:40,490
adapters than it is to backup HMH TLC's

855
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,780
because you no longer have hashing

856
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,819
functions you just have the key

857
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,480
deprivation which we already solved with

858
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:50,029
bit 40-something so not sure very good

859
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,680
question and the thing is when you have

860
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,290
all your private keys you can easily

861
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,299
check which public keys transactions are

862
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,140
included so you see ok in this

863
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:59,029
transaction I have

864
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,430
my input and you see that in this

865
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:03,500
transaction the output has my pop key so

866
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,029
you can still you know prune your full

867
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,640
note to check which transactions are

868
00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:11,569
yours but for the backup I guess it

869
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:13,759
can't be done in HD wallet style okay so

870
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:15,769
does this mean that the Zucco wilcox we

871
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,579
have to buy again on the on the budget

872
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:21,470
angel again in the supermarkets like you

873
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:23,390
know like so does it mean that like the

874
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,368
Tsukuba caucus we have to buy again on

875
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:27,078
the budget angel in the supermarket

876
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:29,450
because he was bragging that he always

877
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,549
buys most more expensive products you

878
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,890
know and in the second question does

879
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:35,599
this really finally rid the space from

880
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:40,129
all the scammy should coins like V crash

881
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,500
Manero - and whatever else is there well

882
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,740
you know the to the second question it's

883
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:48,170
more of a monetary phenomena right media

884
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,490
of exchange is a non zero sum game so

885
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,710
the one with the largest network effect

886
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:54,769
is the winning one and all the others

887
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,690
are losing gain theoretically so I would

888
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:58,519
believe that there is a tendency towards

889
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,829
one single media of exchange that is the

890
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:02,598
most liquid good on the market and I

891
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:05,210
presumably as an economist would say

892
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:07,400
that it's more important to have

893
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,500
economic reliability than to have

894
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,960
privacy in order to be the most liquid

895
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,000
media of exchange

896
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:18,349
so for me I'm an economist first privacy

897
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,720
extremists second and with this I would

898
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:23,089
tend to say that taproot and all the

899
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,959
other magic tools that we can use give

900
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:28,880
us sufficient enough privacy while still

901
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,569
retaining our unbelievable economic

902
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,160
soundness of the base monetary protocol

903
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:37,490
so I would say that something like this

904
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,500
is a net win-win though ultimately this

905
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:41,149
is pure anarchy in money we have Libre

906
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,950
and open-source code running on your own

907
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,900
full note what you run on your own full

908
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:46,009
note is absolutely up to you and you're

909
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,359
an individual with your own unique

910
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:49,970
preferences and you will run whatever

911
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,160
software you choose as so there will not

912
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:54,078
be everyone using Bitcoin I don't I

913
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,180
doubt that I hope don't think that it

914
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,519
will be good to be at that stage but

915
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,649
ultimately you always have the choice to

916
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:04,598
use Bitcoin and now you have the choice

917
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,599
to use Bitcoin unbelievably private

918
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,039
um in your examples you were using like

919
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,049
5,000 blocks in the future but I'm

920
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,900
assuming that these are time locked so

921
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:19,890
in order to make it a safe swap with

922
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,279
someone else you're gonna want to have

923
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:24,839
shorter timeouts correct yeah very very

924
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:26,490
good observation you always have

925
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:28,049
pre-signed time all transactions similar

926
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:32,339
as you do with HDL season lightning

927
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:34,650
Network and with these the it's it's a

928
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:36,808
it's a unique trade-off here because the

929
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:40,410
longer the time lock the more plausible

930
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:42,029
deniability you have right because if

931
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,890
you say okay here's my input and to

932
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:45,930
transit or two blocks later I get my

933
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,690
output then you know your plausible

934
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,848
deniability is rather small but if it's

935
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,890
one happening I mean then there are many

936
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:56,279
many billions of transactions happening

937
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:57,868
that all could be potentially yours so

938
00:39:56,279 --> 00:40:00,000
this is trade-offs it's it's an

939
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:01,680
implementation choice hopefully we will

940
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,660
see many wallets utilizing these schemes

941
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,149
so that we can experiment which ones are

942
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,770
good and ultimately is user choice right

943
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,990
maybe you just want to do a swap maybe

944
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:15,270
even within the same block you could do

945
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:17,700
that too and you know it depends do you

946
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:23,390
think that can also be used for doing

947
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:23,390
financial contracts oh yes

948
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,859
precisely discreet lock contracts is

949
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:32,160
another awesome thing that we can do

950
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:34,500
with Schnoor we can do I mean most most

951
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,078
of this we can do with ECT is a tool but

952
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,450
it's just a hack because easily say is

953
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:40,770
the hack around there's nor patent and

954
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,020
ditional just makes everything so much

955
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:48,089
simpler so yes we can do that already

956
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:51,240
with out points I think is it called any

957
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:52,828
CD's a but with adapter signatures we

958
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,740
can do discrete long contracts and all

959
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:57,539
this that provides a lot of awesome

960
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,640
stuff Yuri the the dude who talked

961
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,430
before me he is actually working on a

962
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:05,339
discreet lock system that is very

963
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:08,578
awesome and that gets a lot easier with

964
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:09,569
with snorunt Abood so we can utilize it

965
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:14,069
yes

966
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:14,520
and you know script ability I had a

967
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:19,558
question

968
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:21,420
what Abhishek mentioned me and that with

969
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:24,329
nor signatures that we when we can

970
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,549
aggregate signatures it's much easier to

971
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:30,390
verify them so the aggregated

972
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:32,819
transactions are actually cheaper so the

973
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:34,799
fees will be lower when I'm going to do

974
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:36,839
for example coin join which can be

975
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:41,609
pretty expensive now so actually it will

976
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:46,170
be it will be more expensive to not be

977
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:48,719
anonymous mmm am i right umm yes a fun

978
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,259
so location or it has noise a huge huge

979
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:51,299
topic

980
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:53,549
and and that's why I always speak of tap

981
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:58,170
root because tap root includes for

982
00:41:53,549 --> 00:42:00,329
example music and music does public key

983
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,880
aggregation and signature aggregation

984
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:04,229
but with communication I think there are

985
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,880
three rounds of communication in order

986
00:42:04,229 --> 00:42:08,788
to generate the pop key and the

987
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,459
aggregated signature and we can do that

988
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:13,529
already that is music and that it's much

989
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:15,808
more efficient to verify one Pupkin

990
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:18,209
signature than it is to verify two of

991
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:20,430
three puppies and signatures with the

992
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:23,399
current multi-sig script that is

993
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:25,709
actually very inefficient to verify so

994
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,319
that yes but what you're saying with

995
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:30,509
coin oh and another thing is that if we

996
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,058
have one block and that block contains

997
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:35,449
many individual tap root pop Keys and

998
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:38,579
tap root signatures then we can do batch

999
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:40,650
verification so I'm not exactly sure how

1000
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:41,939
the magic works but we add up all the

1001
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:44,069
pup keys which are just random numbers

1002
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:45,839
we add up all the signatures which are

1003
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:48,630
just random numbers and then we do one

1004
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,019
pup key signature verification for that

1005
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:53,939
one aggregated but that is not happening

1006
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:55,589
on the time chain that is happening on

1007
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:58,019
your full node verifying the time chain

1008
00:42:55,589 --> 00:43:01,199
so you're more efficient at verifying

1009
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:03,899
blocks that you stamp root and then what

1010
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,089
you say with coin joins that will not be

1011
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,029
included in the taproot upgrade because

1012
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:11,519
that is not just by communication or

1013
00:43:09,029 --> 00:43:13,199
bi-directional communication pipe key

1014
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,029
and signature aggregation this is

1015
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,789
actually something called cross input

1016
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:19,769
signature aggregation so you have many

1017
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:22,469
different inputs with each spending

1018
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:24,569
there you need out point and then you

1019
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:26,579
aggregate them all together you sorry

1020
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:29,069
you a curate the signature of each of

1021
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:31,890
these hundreds of inputs together to one

1022
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:33,390
single aggregated signature and that

1023
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,569
single aggregated signature

1024
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:40,770
is put into the block of the time chain

1025
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:42,990
so this is a much much more broad change

1026
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:44,220
because you know we would have to

1027
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,529
introduce new fields on the block

1028
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:49,799
headers and it would change a lot of

1029
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:52,530
other stuff in consensus so it isn't it

1030
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,810
will take more than much more than two

1031
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:56,910
weeks to get that implemented

1032
00:43:54,810 --> 00:44:00,150
I think it's possible with a soft fork

1033
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:01,740
but it will be a very very massive

1034
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:04,320
change and that's the cool thing with

1035
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:07,319
taproot it's it's not a big change at

1036
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,370
all it's just a cycle duration one from

1037
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,020
version zero to version one there's

1038
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:12,680
almost no consensus change here does it

1039
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,820
doesn't barely touch any consensus code

1040
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,549
but we've crossed input signature

1041
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,980
aggregation that yeah is a lot but what

1042
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:23,190
we can do then for example wasabi does

1043
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:26,700
coin joins with anonymity stat 104

1044
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:28,740
denomination 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.8 so there

1045
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:32,520
are many hundreds of inputs and many

1046
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:33,810
many hundreds of outputs and because a

1047
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,670
zero link when John is already

1048
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:38,070
communicated amongst all these hundreds

1049
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,920
of peers we already have many rounds of

1050
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:43,980
communication so then we could when we

1051
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,110
have this communicate one extra step so

1052
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,510
that every peer of that transaction

1053
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:50,370
signs the transaction and then the

1054
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:53,790
coordinator aggregates all these

1055
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:57,120
signatures so we have 500 inputs in the

1056
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:59,820
transaction but one signature and this

1057
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:03,870
the fee for that one signature is paid

1058
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:06,510
per byte but all of a sudden we have 500

1059
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:09,779
inputs paying the fee of one signature

1060
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:12,350
and this is for every single input

1061
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,420
much cheaper than to pay for the entire

1062
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:18,960
signature of that one input so in this

1063
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,850
case yes by default it is the most

1064
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,610
private to do Cohen joins with giant

1065
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:26,750
anonymity set so that will be a massive

1066
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:29,940
win for privacy but more than two weeks

1067
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:31,380
okay thank you thank you guys and thank

1068
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,800
you guys for your questions but we I'm

1069
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:37,590
sorry but we don't have time for more so

1070
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:39,060
one more thing I'm like all this magic I

1071
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,940
can barely understand it and wrap my

1072
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,320
head around it if you have questions

1073
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,900
there is the unbelievably

1074
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,630
well-documented elements project that is

1075
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,789
written by

1076
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:50,200
snick with an absolute hero of Bitcoin

1077
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:52,509
privacy and pecan development in general

1078
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,129
as well as and repulsed row and so on

1079
00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:56,650
the elements project on github there is

1080
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,299
a script list script repository and that

1081
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:00,430
has a markdown file with a bunch of

1082
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:03,279
different in a written documentation on

1083
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:04,990
the concept of all this and read that

1084
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:07,029
that is all the math magic is happening

1085
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,339
in here and Thank You yonas for

1086
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:09,910
answering all my many many many hundred

1087
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:12,490
questions

1088
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:14,019
he really is awesome so thank you to all

1089
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:15,189
the Bitcoin privacy researchers and

1090
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:16,339
developers and thank you for listening

1091
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:27,579
thank you max

1092
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:27,579
