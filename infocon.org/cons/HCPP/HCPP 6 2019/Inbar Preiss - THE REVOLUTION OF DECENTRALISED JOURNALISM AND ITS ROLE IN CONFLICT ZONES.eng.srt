00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:35,540
so welcome to Slavonic stage I'm very

6
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:38,660
glad that you find your way here and we

7
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:42,800
will just continue with the next speaker

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:45,830
and the next talk but before i shortly

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,140
introduce you i have to say that for us

10
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:51,739
this concept of working of with

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,989
journalists and support them somehow or

12
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:56,209
share with them our knowledge we gather

13
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:59,209
also through you and with the help of

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,909
all of you if we came with a new concept

15
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,640
called media hub and we would like to

16
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:08,170
start very soon concept of co-working

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,140
space for a journalist so also in bar

18
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,479
very well fits into this idea of working

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,920
with journalists and working with

20
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,439
information in maybe a new way but what

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,320
is important now is in bar and her talk

22
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,000
she's a digital nomad an accomplished

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,089
journalist in the feel of blockchain and

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,460
cryptocurrencies working on a

25
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,830
decentralized journalism platform which

26
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,199
aims to expose political conflicts from

27
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,120
within facilitate a dialogue and enable

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,640
free speech following the belief that

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,190
the centralization has the ability to

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,550
transfer societies and empower

31
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:51,710
individuals so this is exactly what I

32
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:54,830
was talking about so the application I

33
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:57,619
completely forgot the name it's called

34
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:00,110
salon talk so definitely for all follow

35
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,910
the sound talk and right now in bar

36
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:09,119
price state is yours thank you

37
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:14,380

38
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:17,590
hi so one year ago I moved back to my

39
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,810
home country Israel for a few months and

40
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,810
there I met a friend and my friend told

41
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:25,290
me about a very simple experience that

42
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:29,200
he had which very much changed the way

43
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,230
he saw reality so what happened was that

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,049
my friend heard about an incident called

45
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:39,220
Molotov kites incident and this is where

46
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:42,940
people from Gaza sent flaming kites over

47
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,820
to Israel and started some fires my

48
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,500
friend wanted to know what people in

49
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,570
Gaza thought about this incident did

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,500
they have the same opinions did everyone

51
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,600
have the same opinion why was it done so

52
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,390
my friend looked through social media

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,940
went on Facebook tried to find someone

54
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,429
from Gaza that he could talk to and in

55
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,910
the end he found Rami and you'll meet

56
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:10,209
Rami in a bit but meanwhile Rami and my

57
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,670
friend veer had a conversation and they

58
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,230
both learned a lot from that

59
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,750
conversation they found out things that

60
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,209
they could have never found out about if

61
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,600
they would just have kept to the news

62
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:24,220
and to what they saw on television and

63
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,140
this was such an enriching experience

64
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,290
that my friend thought everyone deserves

65
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,329
to have the ability and the access to

66
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,190
talk to someone who maybe your political

67
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,930
enemy or maybe on the other side of the

68
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,980
world but sparks an interesting you to

69
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,540
find out more so that became the

70
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,820
foundation on the project that I'm

71
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,679
working on and what I want to share with

72
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,530
you today has been my own exploration of

73
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,690
these themes and it's just the beginning

74
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,690
of the way so let's see

75
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,980
okay so the way I see it it's several

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,549
aspects coming together on one hand we

77
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,519
have politics the conflict itself being

78
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,319
political governments are involved

79
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,239
there's geography separating the people

80
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,238
on the other hand we have media and

81
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,220
communication being the filter through

82
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,518
which people see reality through which

83
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,650
they this is the main way people know

84
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,680
about the other side or what is going on

85
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,570
in the world and this involves the news

86
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,520
industry and the journalism industry and

87
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,770
what I find interesting is when you

88
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,080
combine this with technology what can

89
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:39,190
today's most advanced technology offer

90
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,609
at these two two fields and the

91
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:45,520
intersection between them I find can

92
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,050
lead to interesting aspects especially

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,030
when you implement peer-to-peer networks

94
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,210
and decentralization to allow for direct

95
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,340
communication so in this talk I want to

96
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,060
focus about the israeli-palestinian

97
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,200
conflict and this is what most people

98
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,169
know about the israeli-palestinian

99
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,419
conflict I know this because often when

100
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,310
I say I'm from Israel people suddenly

101
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:10,030
become very concerned for my safety I

102
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,669
don't even live there but this is a

103
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,489
representation of reality I'm not saying

104
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:16,659
that these images are not true they're

105
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,260
very true and they reflect a very

106
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:23,169
serious reality for many people but they

107
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:36,280
don't show the full picture of how

108
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:39,130
people experience it so well I want to

109
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,369
introduce you to Rami who is an engineer

110
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:46,840
he is also the freelance journalist and

111
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:50,530
he has he founded the youth committee in

112
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:55,320
Gaza and he's a very active activist in

113
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:58,450
in in Palestine and he goes through

114
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,580
quite a difficult time being an activist

115
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:04,000
and communicating with Israelis because

116
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:07,830
he his last arrest was this summer in

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,810
July for 40 days where he was

118
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:14,500
interrogated and stressed for

119
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,850
by Hamas to find out why he is

120
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,430
collaborating with Israelis who is

121
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,810
working for but he keeps repeating that

122
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,460
he's just working for himself and every

123
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,470
time he's released he goes back to doing

124
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:27,180
exactly what he was doing before so

125
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,180
let's see what he has to say

126
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,600
[Music]

127
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:41,220
the default picture and default videos

128
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:47,940
Israeli soldiers Palestinian fighters

129
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:50,590
protests in the borders rockets Thanks

130
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,560
Netanyahu and cinema Abu Mazen you know

131
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:57,849
there is no focus any kind of other

132
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:01,180
stories you know there is no full

133
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,700
picture of the reality of lot of trip

134
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,070
and the reality of the relations between

135
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,580
the Israelis and the Palestinians for

136
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:11,170
example I had a chance to visit

137
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,359
Jerusalem in Israel

138
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:18,160
three times in the last five years ago I

139
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,650
saw in many clubs Palestinians and

140
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,920
Israelis dancing with it with each other

141
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,750
I saw by my eyes that many Israelis are

142
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,730
Palestinian they are already neighbors

143
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,070
and they are already friends and they

144
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:33,910
are already touched and listening to one

145
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:36,790
music and they sharing one house and

146
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:40,470
they ate with the same food but there is

147
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:43,450
no media over this kind of is why and

148
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:46,990
some and because of this a problem was

149
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:49,900
only we had many meetings money online

150
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:54,190
meetings with media like Maya appear the

151
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:59,710
old Wynette asking them what where you

152
00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:02,469
are just focusing on this time just you

153
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:07,870
know if the mean if the Israeli media

154
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:11,920
front right they were reflect Gaza are

155
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:15,100
you know full of tricks if the media

156
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,510
from the left they just want to focus on

157
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,660
for now the doctors and even

158
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,409
humanitarian aids and they need money on

159
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,409
food No

160
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:27,929
the media is not really eating pasta we

161
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:32,568
have been for example we have many many

162
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:32,568
stories in Gaza it away from the needy

163
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:42,870
Jenny

164
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:45,209
ignore my face so what Rami was

165
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,110
referring to and part of what he said is

166
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:51,869
that the political influence of

167
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:55,980
mainstream media in Israel tends to

168
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,870
portray Gaza and their experiences in

169
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,350
certain ways depending on whether their

170
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:04,949
life left-wing or right-wing on one hand

171
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,629
having a centralized body in journalism

172
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:08,849
is very very important for verifying

173
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:12,509
news for fact-checking for being an

174
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,370
overseeing body to make sure that what

175
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:18,000
is being presented is as accurate as

176
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,879
possible but on the other hand it's may

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,589
have a role in distorting reality

178
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,829
because there may be ulterior motives

179
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:29,279
such as political agendas or corporate

180
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:31,920
agendas what we see here is a graph of a

181
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,769
recent study which shows it's

182
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,319
representative of American population

183
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:39,949
but I think the general trend can apply

184
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:43,740
to the rest of the world you see a

185
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:47,699
decline in trust in the media as an

186
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:51,089
institution so we see the peak in the

187
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:56,459
70s just around after the Watergate

188
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:59,069
scandal and we see the dip in 2016 just

189
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:00,569
as Trump was getting into power and the

190
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:06,360
fake news narratives who are really

191
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:08,610
proliferating and I just want to show

192
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,370
one more part of what Romney has to say

193
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,639
about the corporate agendas of

194
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,639
mainstream media

195
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:26,420
a special case there are a lot of

196
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:28,319
conflicts and all over the world the

197
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:32,639
israeli-palestinian conflict it's like

198
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:34,979
that's out there North Koreans like it's

199
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:39,089
a conflict at the end so the conflict

200
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,930
has no nationality but sometimes there

201
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,999
are people need to make the

202
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,430
israeli-palestinian conflict as a

203
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:50,790
special country because this kind of

204
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:56,670
conflict make a lot of money a lot of

205
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:59,699
financial project for some local and

206
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,709
international persons maybe the conflict

207
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:04,769
between India and Pakistan there is no

208
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:10,559
money maybe their public between Israel

209
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:11,309
is fine created very high Marty for a hi

210
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,759
Jonathan

211
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:16,740
no we need to both there is there any

212
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,699
personal conflict with other continents

213
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,870
because if you are looking at the world

214
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:28,979
you will find that there are other

215
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:30,749
conflicts and solutions why the

216
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,050
Palestinians and the Israelis with no

217
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:37,429
solutions until now was it's a factory

218
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,429
of money a of dollars

219
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:49,319
so I just want to touch upon the

220
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,330
difference between so-called war and

221
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,880
peace' journalism and this is just to

222
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:56,130
show that there is ethical practice of

223
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,050
journalism or at least a framework for

224
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,210
ethical practice of journalism for

225
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,430
conflict zones and the essential

226
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:05,610
difference is the focus on the action

227
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:09,540
and violence the sparking violence which

228
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:12,080
captures views in in contrast to showing

229
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,060
a more solution based approach and

230
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,660
rather than focusing on just government

231
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,869
officials and elites being involved and

232
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:24,449
making the big decisions also show the

233
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:26,550
grassroots movements and you know the

234
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,710
individual efforts of regular people

235
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,109
people who are involved in the in the

236
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:35,160
conflict and this way show a bit more of

237
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:38,940
a human perspective with more different

238
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:45,240
kinds of perspectives than just the

239
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:47,850
images of violence and to add on to this

240
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,910
I think that being able to decentralize

241
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,040
media and bring in peer-to-peer networks

242
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:57,569
that allow for direct communication

243
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,660
between people can allow us to in a way

244
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,780
create a fuller image of a very complex

245
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:07,230
reality I have here a mosaic picture

246
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:10,560
mosaic arts because I think in the end

247
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,570
of the day reality is just the mosaic of

248
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,300
human experience each of us have our own

249
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,700
perspectives and journalism is not a

250
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,949
math equation there is no absolute truth

251
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,900
because everyone experiences a certain

252
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,490
story from their own perspective so I

253
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,800
think this is something we need to keep

254
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,920
in mind and let go of the notion that

255
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,660
all news needs to be objective in fact

256
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,150
on the other on quite the contrary you

257
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,680
need to acknowledge your stand points

258
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:38,400
know where you're coming from and where

259
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:42,810
you stand in order to to report in the

260
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:45,300
most accurate way the last point here I

261
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:46,859
have is just the difference between homo

262
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,719
filo hetero philia this is something

263
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,490
that plays in role and social media

264
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,970
which has become a very important way of

265
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,500
spreading news we are shown through the

266
00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:00,230
algorithms we are on face

267
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:02,209
many other platforms were shown the

268
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,620
things that are attractive to us things

269
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,979
we already like things we already agree

270
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,690
with and this limits our view on the

271
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,810
other hand maybe we should accept the

272
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,459
other kinds of algorithm which shows us

273
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:18,290
the other exposes us to different

274
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:21,739
realities so this brings me to the next

275
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,959
point of talking to your enemy and if

276
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,639
you're in a position of talking to your

277
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:30,199
political enemy you've already come a

278
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:34,220
long way but I want to examine what it

279
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:36,709
is that makes it difficult and what we

280
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:41,120
can gain from having these kinds of

281
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:42,589
conversations and how you can have a

282
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,240
conversation with someone that you are

283
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:46,730
conditioned to hate but actually don't

284
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:52,160
know anything about and what can we do

285
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:54,350
to facilitate this process this summer I

286
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,310
had the opportunity to go to the West

287
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:00,760
Bank with the journalism group and there

288
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,469
we had an encounter with the mayor of

289
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,600
area called calcula which is signified

290
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,850
on the map

291
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:12,920
and he told us about his experience with

292
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:15,769
Israelis more specifically he said that

293
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,660
in his words in melon my translated

294
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:19,940
words we want to live together and

295
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,819
coexist referring to living with the

296
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,850
Israelis and his experience as occupied

297
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:27,979
West Bank we want to live in dignity and

298
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,810
be listened to we pay the price of the

299
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,139
politicians who create this reality of

300
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,459
hatred and distrust between our nation's

301
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:36,079
but there is no chance for dialogue

302
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,209
since the only Israelis we see or

303
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,029
soldiers who humiliate and threaten us

304
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:43,399
or settlers who take our land and this

305
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:45,430
quote that I have written up here I

306
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,810
thought was particularly significant

307
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,579
when watching and reading the mainstream

308
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,680
news people are drinking from the pipes

309
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,388
of the government but you who came to

310
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,910
listen to the people living here came to

311
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:59,089
drink from the fresh water Springs so

312
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:01,910
this is something that I hope can be

313
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:07,579
shared and give people the opportunity

314
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:10,189
to drink you know fresh water and romney

315
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:20,689
has a similar perspective

316
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:24,620
I think it's not safe to talk directly

317
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:28,010
about that israeli/palestinian it's but

318
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:32,270
believe me that all of the Palestinians

319
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,939
hearing us looking for this dreaming

320
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:37,819
about peace but there is no leaders

321
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:40,190
present the peaceful voices here in Gaza

322
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,650
Strip over traumas and also the

323
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,930
Palestinian factions the proscenium

324
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,060
factions talking about the truth

325
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:52,010
fourteen years with these variables

326
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:55,489
I think truce agreement 14 is like peace

327
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:58,880
agreement so there is no different it's

328
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:06,709
just a war between peace agreement for a

329
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:13,670
truce agreement so we are here working

330
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:16,939
for the future and also we are thinking

331
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,860
how we can create good Palestinian

332
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:23,199
leaders for the future leading the civil

333
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:27,619
society in the same side working with

334
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:31,240
Israelis figures in civil society and

335
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:41,780
critical field to create a new kind of

336
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:45,110
Netanyahu and sit in one table and do

337
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:49,460
something you know it's because we will

338
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:54,260
be in this conflict for infinity for

339
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:57,200
sure no we need to do something we need

340
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,900
the people hearing us order in Israel to

341
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,500
make them understand each other respect

342
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,500
each other

343
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:23,419
so one way to ease the way to allowing

344
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,730
Israelis and Palestinians to talk to

345
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:29,020
each other directly and talk about the

346
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:32,960
most pressing and difficult issues of

347
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:37,220
occupation or of the conflict is to

348
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,400
gamify this this conversation and the

349
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,380
programmer that I'm working with is very

350
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,270
very inspired by this action and he's

351
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,039
very motivated to work on this and this

352
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,658
is the way he explains it why is it so

353
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,970
important this is because the only way

354
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:52,460
to decentralize power is to gamify

355
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:55,309
conflict resolution all politics is

356
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,020
gamified conflict resolution when

357
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:59,059
conflict resolution is gamified and

358
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,549
given to the masses power becomes

359
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:03,678
decentralized and eventually no one

360
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:08,120
needs politicians only good problem

361
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,870
solvers so this sounds a bit vague but

362
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,059
let me give you an example

363
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:18,010
there is a pure Handelman who is an

364
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:21,399
Israeli academic and the chairman of

365
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:23,658
minds of Peace Initiative and he is a

366
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:26,320
negotiation moderator and he what he

367
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:28,159
does is bring together Israelis and

368
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,549
Palestinians from all the political

369
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:35,539
spectrums brings them together for five

370
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:37,100
hours in one room and they have to come

371
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:40,908
up with the solution for the conflict

372
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,678
simple as that and what he goes to show

373
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:46,700
is that and I'll show you the video in a

374
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:48,860
moment but he's showing that in fact it

375
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,200
is possible to reach an agreement and in

376
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,479
this way put pressure on politicians

377
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,190
which have not been doing this job very

378
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,539
well but it's very important to have

379
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,390
rules through these conversations

380
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:01,669
because things can easily slide down a

381
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:05,000
slippery slope the rules that he

382
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:08,090
discusses are focusing on the future not

383
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,289
digging into the past and no blaming and

384
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,230
no insulting and this is a very

385
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:15,879
important role of the moderator so if we

386
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,880
could play the video

387
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:50,159
I think it's impossible it's going to be

388
00:20:47,399 --> 00:21:09,090
tough but let's see what happens let's

389
00:20:50,159 --> 00:21:11,460
negotiate we believe that the missing

390
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,619
component in almost any peacemaking

391
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,200
initiative is the involvement of the

392
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:18,809
people and our vision is to create a

393
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,429
major public negotiating Congress that

394
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,560
can involve the people and press the

395
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:30,330
leadership

396
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:33,490
[Music]

397
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,409
everyone in the back of his heart know

398
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,900
that this conflict cannot continue

399
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,700
forever it's going to be catastrophe so

400
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,590
people came to listen to make their

401
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:46,140
opinions in order to find solution to

402
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:48,399
the conflict so we would like

403
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:52,570
Palestinians and Palestinian Authority

404
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:56,050
will denounce any killing of innocent

405
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,310
people before that we live together we

406
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,100
live together at this

407
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:02,919
but the occupation is a big reason for

408
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,020
this thing the environment in the

409
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,270
checkpoints is inciting a lot of

410
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,340
violence you won't be able to do it so

411
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:14,020
don't cheat me with that promise I don't

412
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:17,639
mean you guys in US and we speak about

413
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,639
the future we want to build

414
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,789
[Music]

415
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:44,320
do you know I don't know what do you

416
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:46,180
mean with that joke about one out of

417
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,970
each agreement which one agreement about

418
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:51,250
trust villagers which was very very

419
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,870
difficult and now we are debating what

420
00:22:51,250 --> 00:23:00,850
is the solution to this very pasty in

421
00:22:52,870 --> 00:23:03,370
conflict and it's not easy no one is

422
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:07,120
going to leave Jerusalem and perhaps if

423
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:09,040
you'll have time Lucilla miss the macro

424
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:15,429
micro solution let's agree to disagree

425
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:19,450
and talk about it later everyone agree

426
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:26,740
to the two-state solution yes so we

427
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:30,550
reach an agreement the negotiation is

428
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:33,400
easy but difficult is how we can do that

429
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:36,820
in future both sides know it's kind of a

430
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,340
game you're not really taking the

431
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,740
responsibility of implementing the

432
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,510
treaty that is great I believe it's

433
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,000
important it's important also for the

434
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:49,679
youth to express themselves to say ideas

435
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,869
without being afraid

436
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,809
security concerns I like very much what

437
00:23:52,869 --> 00:24:07,539
we did today but it's just reminded how

438
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:10,029
much work so I thought that was pretty

439
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:12,580
cool but there are some problems when

440
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:14,289
having these kind of conversations some

441
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,210
of the problems include if you just

442
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:18,879
allow anyone to come in and discuss

443
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,739
conflict resolution its lack of

444
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:22,590
knowledge or the lack of education the

445
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:26,080
lack of language or slipping into

446
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:28,228
emotional stories of the people who are

447
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,239
experiencing this and it's not easy so

448
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:35,229
what's appears is now busy doing is

449
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:37,179
developing an AI to help moderate these

450
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:39,789
kind of conversations and have an

451
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:42,249
intelligent digitally intelligent

452
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:44,619
environment that can whip out the right

453
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:47,019
information at the right time and keep

454
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:49,418
people on the right track so I think

455
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:57,909
this is an interesting project that I'm

456
00:24:49,419 --> 00:25:00,369
curious to see how it will end up and

457
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:03,220
it's also an example of how bringing in

458
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:06,428
technology can really bring these

459
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:09,609
conversations to the next level in

460
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:13,119
addition to this technology can bring in

461
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:14,889
censorship resistance for example one in

462
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,228
five protects communication from

463
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:20,199
censorship and surveillance it's a

464
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:23,289
protocol that allows for intelligent

465
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,479
routing to ensure that everything is

466
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:29,470
highly private and anonymous relaying

467
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:31,749
through different networks privacy non

468
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:35,139
unanimity are very important when in

469
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:37,090
very sensitive political zones because

470
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:39,399
there's high consequences to discussing

471
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:42,789
certain things or being in contact with

472
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:45,129
certain people the peer-to-peer networks

473
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:47,679
allow for totally centralization and not

474
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:49,959
having a central authority to filter out

475
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,169
information this may be problematic in

476
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,210
another way but the power of having the

477
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:58,629
multitude of information is also very

478
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:01,179
important reputation systems can ensure

479
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:02,750
the quality of information just like we

480
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:07,640
know from uber and airbnb

481
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:09,440
this way allows us to think twice about

482
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:14,840
who we interact with based on their

483
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:19,220
reviews and open source information

484
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:21,169
allows everyone to adapt their own

485
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,200
technology to what their own needs so if

486
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:26,540
we have gheymeh fide conversations about

487
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,790
certain issues people can take and make

488
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,610
their own versions for their own issues

489
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,480
that they find important and

490
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,719
transparency is another important issue

491
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,460
that decentralized technology is able to

492
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:44,330
provide for these kind of sensitive

493
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:46,930
topics so what I see today I'm happy to

494
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:51,139
see that there are a lot of initiatives

495
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:52,580
mushrooming around responding to one of

496
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,100
the greatest contemporary issues of our

497
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:59,000
time which is the way the media is going

498
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:01,300
and the biases that we see in media and

499
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,660
today that everyone has a smartphone and

500
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:10,700
can contribute their own information has

501
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:12,110
its consequences so I think that it's

502
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,270
nice to see many different initiatives

503
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:18,320
taking different approaches to media

504
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:20,240
what I find particularly important is

505
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,770
the direct contact as we've seen

506
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,980
throughout this talk it has changed

507
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,060
lives just the direct conversation with

508
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,320
someone on the other side of the border

509
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:34,270
that you wouldn't have been able to have

510
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,770
otherwise I'm happy if we see more

511
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:38,090
humanity and storytelling in the news

512
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,700
and blur the lines between the

513
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:43,510
consumption and production of news so

514
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,290
that everyone is participating in a way

515
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:50,210
focusing on grassroots initiatives to

516
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,399
keep the balance between the focus on

517
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,700
elites which is often the case in

518
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,400
mainstream industry of news and to allow

519
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,020
for dialogue and gamification and also

520
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,830
importantly use technology to empower

521
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:06,320
rather than to survey or censor

522
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:08,810
information and at the end of the day I

523
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,939
hope that communication and media can

524
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:13,950
provide an enriching experience for

525
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,260
people who use end

526
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,900
and yeah so I'm just on at the beginning

527
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,660
of my way here so there's many questions

528
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,640
that are remained unanswered many more

529
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,620
issues to tackle and if you're

530
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,850
interested in the project we always are

531
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,860
looking for help and if you have any

532
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,860
questions that we have to hear thank you

533
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:46,410
okay so now it's your time so is there

534
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:49,139
any question of this okay hi thanks for

535
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,640
the talk I just as a Israeli myself who

536
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,920
doesn't live there I just want to say

537
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,830
it's amazing what you did here it's

538
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:59,300
bringing another perspective to Europe I

539
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:02,970
think it's essential because it's so

540
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:06,710
horrible to see how one-sided this

541
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:11,460
conversation were in the media how

542
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:14,430
biased major media outlet in regards to

543
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,460
this conflict and just yeah keep up the

544
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,290
good job it's it's amazing thank you if

545
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,430
you need any help I know how to reach

546
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:25,980
you thank you so much

547
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:33,860
dated okay there was another question

548
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:39,420
so let's drive one more time okay yeah

549
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:42,330
really great talk I think it's very

550
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:45,000
important that you pointed out you know

551
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:47,790
one was kind of dealing with conflict

552
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,560
one was dealing with peace that you had

553
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:54,270
that slide you want to go back to yes

554
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:57,000
please that was very interesting yeah

555
00:29:54,270 --> 00:30:00,090
this is a was developed in the 1970s by

556
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,070
a scholar called Johan galtung so it's

557
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:06,179
quite a well-established

558
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:07,470
field right what was your question um no

559
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,180
I just really liked it because they

560
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:11,250
remind me of these things like what you

561
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,170
fight you become you know and a lot of

562
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,930
projects can get really into like

563
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:19,200
fighting something you know a rather you

564
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:20,730
embrace peace you come up with solutions

565
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,670
you know like you you're written on it

566
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:25,050
they're like solution orientated whereas

567
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,850
the other one it's just like no this is

568
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,190
happening to me

569
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,469
this is happening to me so I really like

570
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,240
that yeah so the main difference is

571
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,630
focusing on the eruption of violence

572
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,260
rather than the ongoing effects people's

573
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:43,190
mentality and as that has that like what

574
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:47,179
was it developed for well the Johan

575
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,500
galtung he's uh he was scholar in the

576
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,960
field of conflict and conflict

577
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,330
resolution so this is his application in

578
00:30:50,960 --> 00:31:00,559
journalism thank you

579
00:30:53,330 --> 00:31:01,490
thank you hi in bar hi thank you as well

580
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,210
thank you

581
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:07,460
what I found really intriguing was you

582
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,700
mentioned that there are some attempts

583
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:13,130
to use AI to create smart environment

584
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,900
for conflict resolution can you please

585
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:16,190
expand on that I mean I would like to

586
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,110
know if there are some projects that are

587
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,870
already working on this or I mean what's

588
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:23,418
any further info so I have very limited

589
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:27,860
info this is what I heard from superior

590
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:29,750
from the chairman of the minds of Peace

591
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,449
Initiative it's something he's working

592
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,309
on and that was information he gave me I

593
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,500
can't really tell you much more if you

594
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,990
want I can give you his details then

595
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,140
maybe you can ask him yes perfect thank

596
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,140
you

597
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:54,440
hey my question is about crypto

598
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:56,720
technologies as a journalist so um are

599
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:02,149
you using any and if so what are your

600
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,020
complaints if you have any about using

601
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:04,340
crypto currencies

602
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:11,510
yeah crypto technologies in general

603
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:12,649
rather my complaints I don't have too

604
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:16,070
many complaints I don't use it very

605
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:19,658
daily how you I guess it could be more

606
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:21,620
user friendly at times for people but I

607
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:32,770
don't have too many complaints to be

608
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:36,340
honest thank you okay another question

609
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:38,120
maybe I would like to ask about the

610
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,039
recommendations which were at the end

611
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,689
how the journalism should look you are

612
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:43,789
saying that there should be kind of less

613
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,190
focus on objectivity and more focus on

614
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:48,860
storytelling like when I read mainstream

615
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:52,730
media sometimes like all the other

616
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:55,070
columnist soar like anything which is

617
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:58,490
not direct reporting I think there is

618
00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:01,129
sort of kind of too much of storytelling

619
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,809
that they are pushing their own agenda

620
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:05,870
either from one site or from the other

621
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:07,940
side and it's from my perspective it's

622
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,979
kind of not readable and I am more or

623
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,529
less tweeting of reading of this stuff

624
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,899
at all mm-hmm so why do you think this

625
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:18,169
is a very forward or maybe maybe in your

626
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:21,199
case like Israel Palestine that might be

627
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:22,610
like our edge case but in general why do

628
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,820
you think you would do more storytelling

629
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:28,580
and less kind of focus on objectivity I

630
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:31,010
think maybe it's not it's not a matter

631
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,399
of eliminating the so-called objective

632
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,110
facts but I think I think that media

633
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,489
platforms should put a bit more effort

634
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:43,610
into not claiming objectivity too fast

635
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:45,529
not having the claim to saying that

636
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,959
they're publishing the absolutes and

637
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:50,630
only truth because just a matter of a

638
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,730
few words or a choice of words already

639
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,649
puts you in a position why did you say

640
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,659
terrorists are not fighter why did you

641
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:58,020
say this and that so it's more than you

642
00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:01,080
ants

643
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:05,730
which is what perhaps my problem is with

644
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,470
claiming to objectivity perhaps saying

645
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,020
that I'm not saying that the news should

646
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,510
be all storytelling and and so on but I

647
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:16,109
think that objectivity is something that

648
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:19,080
we should reconsider when when referring

649
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:21,319
to hope that answers your question more

650
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,319
or less

651
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:36,929
yeah many texts or you talk I want to

652
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:40,089
ask you something that I was asked about

653
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:44,500
when I talked about Israel when I had a

654
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:48,279
session about it I was asked if there

655
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:50,730
are any sources or media outlets that

656
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,780
can be trusted

657
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:57,250
regarding the israeli-palestinian

658
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:58,960
conflict and I won't ask you if like

659
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:02,800
what's your opinion if you know if you

660
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,680
think that there are any I'm actually

661
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,680
I'm looking for it as well so no we can

662
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,549
stay in touch on that one but um I'm

663
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,020
sure there are there are many

664
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,859
initiatives out there I can double check

665
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:17,530
for a few that I've forgotten the name

666
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:18,569
but I don't have any off the top of my

667
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:26,220
head

668
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:26,220
unfortunately okay

669
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:40,960
hi thanks for the talk my question is

670
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:43,900
related to implementation how would you

671
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,360
avoid your absalom talk becoming a

672
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:49,300
shitshow so people just going on it to

673
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:53,200
lie or spreading misinformation for the

674
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:56,530
sake of like making the conflict resolve

675
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,359
itself in one way or just for like the

676
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:01,510
sake of being a troll Thanks

677
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,220
so yeah that is a very serious issue and

678
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:06,130
I don't have all the answers as I said

679
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,899
before this is a work in progress so I

680
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,930
was hoping that the reputation system

681
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:13,240
and reviewing system would be a strong

682
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:16,480
incentive for people to provide good

683
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,600
quality and marginalize the lower

684
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,280
quality of information but then again

685
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,319
this is a bit more complicated because

686
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,430
people within the conflicts may have

687
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:30,130
their own dispositions and agendas and

688
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:33,430
emotional background so if anyone knows

689
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:35,200
about a clever way to verify news and in

690
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:37,868
these kind of decentralized environments

691
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,490
because the aim here is not to go

692
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:41,230
through centralized bodies but rather

693
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,089
avoided and have an ecosystem where

694
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,980
these things happen organically and

695
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:47,200
perhaps thinking about a reputation

696
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,980
system alone would be sufficient for

697
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,540
this perhaps that isn't any naive idea

698
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,750
this is something that perhaps needs to

699
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,790
be tested out first

700
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:01,560
so yeah I'm currently struggling with

701
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:08,440
the same question as well so thank you

702
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:11,529
hi thanks for an inspiring talk and my

703
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,230
question is about social media so it is

704
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:16,510
known that they promote like stories

705
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,910
filled with emotions fear and anger and

706
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,570
people also are kind of world off and

707
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,890
they don't release like meet in person

708
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:27,400
so they are not afraid to say some

709
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:30,129
things that like hurtful hurtful things

710
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,410
and do you think that social media might

711
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:35,390
be or are you concerned they might be

712
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:38,990
counter intuitive for

713
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:41,569
for any initiative like yours I think

714
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:44,359
that having a moderator is very

715
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:47,360
important so just as discussed before I

716
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,430
think I mentioned that having a

717
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,190
moderator to establish rules of the

718
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:55,250
conversation to establish that there is

719
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:57,920
no you know those focusing on the future

720
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,810
and no blaming and insulting the other

721
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,020
and having a constructive conversation

722
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:05,029
is very important for these for these

723
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:08,150
interactions that's for sure so when it

724
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:10,160
comes to group interactions there will

725
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,870
need to be a moderator who is

726
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,089
volunteering to be an ambassador for

727
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:18,130
that kind of initiative how would you

728
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:23,600
measure the health of a conversation

729
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:25,970
reviews there's will be hopefully silent

730
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,730
watcher is watching as well and giving

731
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,439
overview so also this is work in

732
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,440
progress so we'll have to see how

733
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:44,150
different implementations can work out

734
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:46,370
thank you okay any other questions what

735
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,440
role do you think that cryptocurrencies

736
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:51,710
are gonna have in the future with

737
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:55,160
conflict resolution because if we defund

738
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:58,490
the government's then these wars will

739
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,149
hopefully stop on their own that would

740
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:05,000
be quite a radical step for sure well

741
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:07,520
with let's see we can see how it played

742
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,530
out in Venezuela having the economic

743
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,030
collapse there and the political

744
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,100
collapse as well

745
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:15,380
Bitcoin saving many lives for people so

746
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:20,779
perhaps in conflict zones where people

747
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:23,540
have maybe a lot less opportunity to to

748
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:26,900
turn to and then cryptocurrencies are a

749
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:30,110
good option and a safe option so I think

750
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,280
that when it comes to wealthy funding

751
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:33,880
governments I think there's a long way

752
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,660
to go until something like that happens

753
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:41,090
but if if such a collapse does occur

754
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:45,790
then there will be an alternative for

755
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,790
people to turn to thank you Thanks

756
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:53,550
okay there was a question hello thank

757
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,670
you for being here today

758
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:59,130
my question is directly on your personal

759
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,830
opinions you who are talking a lot about

760
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,420
the israeli-palestinian conflict what do

761
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:06,029
you see as their reason for the entire

762
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,450
conflict and do you see a solution to

763
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:11,760
and also the last thing is you are

764
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:14,069
talking about the debate when Israelis

765
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,530
and Palestinians we're talking together

766
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,750
and finding the solution do you actually

767
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:22,650
believe that what they are establishing

768
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:25,260
there could have an influence on like

769
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:27,870
the overall solution if it will get if

770
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:30,540
it will get ever resolved like do you

771
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:32,910
think they are truly able to change the

772
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:37,850
solution if any of the Israelis in the

773
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:40,470
room want to contribute feel free what

774
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:42,029
no okay that's a very complicated

775
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,850
question and I'm really I don't think

776
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,560
I'm in the position to establish the the

777
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:48,930
truth of the cause of the Palestine

778
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,200
conflicts it's a it's a dirty history

779
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:57,870
and a series of unfortunate events and

780
00:40:52,200 --> 00:41:02,100
claims to many things so second part of

781
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:04,170
the question was what it was um I think

782
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,790
what I've heard I didn't grow up there

783
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,250
myself so I have a bit of an outsider's

784
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:10,050
view but from going back and being there

785
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:13,020
I've heard a lot of people say there's

786
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:14,700
no way this conflict is gonna last it

787
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,410
will be over within our lifetime in it

788
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,060
that was something that gave me a lot of

789
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:21,560
hope because I could I can't imagine it

790
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:24,779
ending the way things are going but

791
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,520
things move fast and speaking to people

792
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,140
like Romney and like Sapir and putting

793
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,000
the effort in and it does make you

794
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,890
realize that this can't go on forever

795
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,650
it's very unsustainable for both for

796
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:39,470
anyone involved so we'll see what

797
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:39,470
happens after these elections so yeah

798
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:46,250
okay so last chance I see the hand that

799
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,250
I do there

800
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,570
thank you very much for the talk very

801
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,550
interesting and inspiring I'm wondering

802
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:59,130
if you have any thoughts or even

803
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:02,520
recommendations on the consumption side

804
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:04,380
of media because we can have even like

805
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,060
even social media or blogs something

806
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,610
like that where we suddenly can listen

807
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,620
to people from the other side which is

808
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,610
often problematic and we meet people

809
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,130
like you

810
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:16,320
Mikami in this case do you have any

811
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:19,800
recommendations or thoughts on that in

812
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:22,590
general recommendations on platforms

813
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,280
which offer a direct communication yes

814
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:28,440
or like probably even getting away from

815
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,230
like the main media about listening more

816
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,330
trying to find more people on social

817
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,280
media on the other side there is there's

818
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:37,290
plenty of initiatives and groups I mean

819
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,510
just on Facebook there's already a lot

820
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:42,050
of groups with Israelis and Palestinians

821
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,910
meeting and Arab Palestinians and

822
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:46,500
Israelis together there's also an

823
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,870
initiative called Skype with their enemy

824
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,860
which is also very much on the similar

825
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:55,799
kind of lines so that it's just having a

826
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:57,630
Skype conversation with with someone on

827
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,650
the other side of the border and that's

828
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:02,760
something that Rami was also involved in

829
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:05,220
so yes once you look into it there's

830
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,770
plenty of yeah as you mentioned there's

831
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:12,270
a lot of blogs perhaps I can send you a

832
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:14,910
few links and that's the thing these

833
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:17,640
these conversations are happening what

834
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:21,299
I'm the Salam Tok application in itself

835
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:24,390
is not innovative in that way people are

836
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:28,260
talking what I'm hoping to provide is a

837
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:30,930
platform for discovering high quality

838
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,640
conversations and for allowing other

839
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,470
people to tune into these conversations

840
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,509
as well and create an ecosystem in which

841
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:41,629
people can feel free to express

842
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:41,630
themselves okay thank you thank you

843
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,900
okay I think we ran out of time so this

844
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,030
was the last question so I'd like to

845
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,980
thank you in bar for delivering here

846
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:54,050
thank you presentation I would like

847
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:57,560
thanks also the audience for staying

848
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:59,660
with us and as you see and actually from

849
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,078
all of your questions when we were like

850
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,848
so thankful to this presentation it's

851
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:07,369
just the moment when you realize that

852
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:08,900
it's very important in these times to

853
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:11,109
work with journalists to work with

854
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:15,230
information and to find a way how to

855
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:17,000
fight the not just fake but everything

856
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:20,470
was there and hopefully the conflict it

857
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,470
will be history soon so

858
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:28,219
[Applause]
