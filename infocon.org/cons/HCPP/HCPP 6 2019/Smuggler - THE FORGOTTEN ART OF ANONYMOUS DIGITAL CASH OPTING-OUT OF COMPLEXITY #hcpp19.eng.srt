[Music]

3
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,230
well this is like opening the main star

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,660
really it's it's amazing how you always

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:43,019
feel the filter Krauts what are you

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:50,390
doing welcome of course mister it's

7
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:55,559
coming who knows this this little thing

8
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:59,550
opened I'm is your hands alright I'm not

9
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,709
a page hill for Rodolfo but I like this

10
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,099
little thing it's a better asset for

11
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,159
bitcoins it's the most private

12
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,259
peer-to-peer face-to-face way to to hand

13
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,810
over bitcoins to someone else without

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,130
making a trace on the Bitcoin blockchain

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,650
and privacy and you know hiding your

16
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,810
transactions there's always been of the

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,330
interest of many researchers and even

18
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,340
before even Bitcoin started and before

19
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,990
it was cool there was a lot of other

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,790
researchers putting a lot of thought

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:35,880
into how to make completely sensor she

22
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,900
persistent and anonymous and fast and

23
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,060
scalable and cheap transactions online

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:45,150
but there's some people that claim to

25
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,450
know how to do it even offline and that

26
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,990
smuggler was coming to talk today he's a

27
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,060
he's a quality assurance for every time

28
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,800
he's talking on this event it's a it's

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,360
an excellent talk so I'm really excited

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,190
to welcome him again

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,100
he's a privacy extremist he's a cyber

32
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,830
Punk and crypto anarchist if I may say

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,250
that for 25 years he's been doing a lot

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,430
of researching in the area of privacy

35
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,700
and a lot of projects that he's been

36
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,420
participating in but this one is this

37
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,359
all this project now finally coming to

38
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,859
the world and fruition so please give a

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,560
welcome to smuggler

40
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,560
thank you thank you

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,120
I'm always not sure why so many people

42
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:45,080
come to my talks and I'm trying my best

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,030
to not disappoint you this time and I

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,920
usually don't give technical talks so

45
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,830
this is the most technical talk I've

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,579
ever given at HTTP so bear with me

47
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:59,390
please

48
00:02:52,580 --> 00:03:01,540
no no jokes and stuff there is a thing

49
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:05,059
and there is the forgotten art of

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:08,570
anonymous digital cache you know there

51
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,640
was a time before the blockchain I'm not

52
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,690
sure if anybody a few is old enough to

53
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,239
remember that

54
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:17,810
but the blockchain hasn't been there

55
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,720
forever and a lot of people in the any

56
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,390
crypto emic is seen today and media and

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,700
whatever actually believe that no

58
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:30,200
digital money existed before Bitcoin

59
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:32,390
came along and I am old I remember the

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:37,429
days before the blockchain we didn't

61
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:41,988
have stuff like UT exo's and I kind of

62
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:44,900
want to introduce you to a little bit of

63
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:48,530
my history like how I grew up with

64
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,320
crypto anarchy and a project that I've

65
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,310
been on and off involved in or actually

66
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:58,250
a technology not necessarily project

67
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,870
because I want to tell you about a past

68
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:04,910
that has to be forgotten by everybody

69
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:08,560
who can spell blockchain and in a way

70
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:12,200
it's not just a past but I'd like to

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:17,600
present to you an alternative reality on

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:22,820
how to do digital anonymous payments

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:26,169
very fast now before we do all of that

74
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,390
we should kind of remind ourselves what

75
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:31,849
this whole value and money and currency

76
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:35,900
is about so when we're talking about

77
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:39,410
money we're talking about two things

78
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,599
we're talking about the VTS which is

79
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,819
value transfer systems in general

80
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,729
so value transfer system is what allows

81
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:48,649
you to use money it doesn't really

82
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,599
matter that you have a piece of paper

83
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:53,300
that says 10 euros when you're not able

84
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:55,550
to transfer it to somebody else money

85
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,309
that you cannot pay with is no money and

86
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:03,259
then you have certain functions that

87
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:05,419
money kindness should represent you have

88
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:07,369
the value itself you know valueless

89
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:10,549
money is no money you know if it doesn't

90
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:12,499
buy you anything it is no good then you

91
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,499
have to be able to transfer it as I said

92
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:20,020
before and ideally you also want to

93
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:22,939
storage it because not all value that is

94
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,330
transferable is also storable so for

95
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:29,569
example being at the conference is a

96
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,878
valuable thing but it's it's also

97
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:33,709
transferable you can invite people but

98
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:38,059
you cannot store the experience you know

99
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:40,429
except for your memory so that's one

100
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:42,919
thing but the other thing is that monies

101
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:45,109
can come in very different form even if

102
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,149
we call them the same by the same name

103
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,269
but I'll come back to that later it's

104
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:52,219
really important okay when you're

105
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:55,149
talking about digital money and

106
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:58,399
especially money that is not that

107
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:59,990
government approved we have certain

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,990
risks that come along with that

109
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,389
so the the fundamental risk everybody

110
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,219
knows mouths money is this thing called

111
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,589
theft you know yeah if there's

112
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:11,930
ten-year-old sitting on the table in

113
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:13,490
front of you you go to the loo and you

114
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,300
come back it's not there anymore that's

115
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,249
called theft or paying your bill then

116
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,979
you have the whole issue of technical

117
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:23,659
and operational risks if you're issuing

118
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:25,519
money if you're operating a bank

119
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:28,099
whatever things can go wrong

120
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,649
you know your building burns down the

121
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:31,490
only admin that knew the password to the

122
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:33,769
database

123
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,610
it runs in front of the bus stuff like

124
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:40,879
that so you have certain risks operation

125
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:42,740
then you have something that I think

126
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,899
we're often not aware of and that is the

127
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,949
whole thing of locking and monoculture

128
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:55,180
so imagine PayPal was the only way you

129
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:55,180
can pay nobody is laughing

130
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,680
imagine it you know it that's like the

131
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,489
definition of horror you know you might

132
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,320
be able to pay and in a certain low

133
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,550
probability you might actually receive

134
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:13,460
the money pay to you and then you have

135
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,730
this issue that there are people that

136
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,650
issue money that you cannot trust

137
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:21,800
because they discover hey instead of

138
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,229
robbing a bank I got an open one you

139
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,940
know and then I got a claim that you

140
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,670
know the money you paid in on your

141
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,820
account is actually there just don't ask

142
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,410
for it again you know just look at the

143
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,320
number and be happy with that you know

144
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:40,370
but don't ask me for a return and then

145
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:43,190
you have fungibility what verse is any

146
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:46,030
money if the person you want to pay says

147
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:50,330
oh you know what your money

148
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:53,750
kinda stinks you know it's maybe

149
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:56,150
affiliated with the wrong business have

150
00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:00,230
you laundered it well you know so that

151
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:03,710
is fun ability but when you're dealing

152
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:07,760
with the government do you have a real

153
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,229
issue that is government risk personally

154
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,120
I considered the government as one of

155
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,900
the biggest risks that exists on this

156
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,470
planet

157
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:20,330
[Applause]

158
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:24,860
there was a cheap one I know but thank

159
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,900
you because governments have this

160
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,610
tendency to go around and say you know

161
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,520
what you shouldn't be issuing money and

162
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,620
by the way give me all you have you know

163
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,919
that seems to be a modus operandi of

164
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:40,700
those groups and then you have this

165
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,409
privacy issue it kind of privacy would

166
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,839
be an issue without governments as well

167
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,810
but with governments privacy is a real

168
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:51,230
big issue you know if the government can

169
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:54,319
say oh yeah you paid for a natural

170
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,980
occurring plant you know and you go for

171
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,350
jail for doing it that is a privacy risk

172
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,240
you know you want to be able to make

173
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:07,100
payments without going to jail for them

174
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,080
most of the time and then there's I put

175
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,410
the market in there so what the market

176
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,360
is that's all the people on the planet

177
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,300
kind of making decisions about what to

178
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,850
do individually and then you have an

179
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,890
accumulation of behavior and what really

180
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,250
is the outcome of that nobody of us can

181
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:28,640
tell so the market has tendencies like

182
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:32,690
being irrational much longer than you're

183
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,610
funded or choosing the second best

184
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,920
option and not the first beggar's option

185
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,779
and stuff like that so no matter how

186
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,520
good your systems are and what you do

187
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:45,950
you might still fail and then all these

188
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,510
things all these risks are things we

189
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,240
take into account when you design your

190
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:53,660
system but you also take into account

191
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,790
function remember the first second slide

192
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:59,120
you know you have to transfer you have

193
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:02,180
to store you have to have value most

194
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,060
blockchain currencies have turned in

195
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:08,959
their history into making the decision

196
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:11,329
that storing money is more important

197
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,939
than transferring it so it's really

198
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,140
important to keep your money and to keep

199
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,520
the value of your money

200
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:21,920
maybe but sending the money and making

201
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,650
that debt trivial and private and

202
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,699
whatever is something that is like a

203
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:29,250
second issue in a lot of developments

204
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,589
today

205
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:36,810
now as I said before same slide second

206
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:39,300
one I think you know there are different

207
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:42,329
kinds of money you know just because we

208
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,550
call something euro or US dollar doesn't

209
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:46,219
mean that it's the same money it's the

210
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,779
same currency it's not the same money

211
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,319
because money's come in different forms

212
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,300
so for example let's take a bank you can

213
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:58,500
have different kinds of euros in the

214
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:00,719
bank the thing that most people think

215
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,199
what they do when they give money to the

216
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,600
bank is that they do a deposit but

217
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:08,370
depository money means that the bank

218
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,589
takes your money puts it into his safe

219
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,649
and writes your name on it there's a

220
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,389
depository most banks never do that for

221
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:18,569
you because all of us are not rich

222
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:22,920
enough for getting that service what we

223
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:26,120
do is we have G gyro or that money you

224
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,009
know gyro money is you give their bank

225
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,350
money and the money just promises are

226
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:33,870
the bank just promises you to maybe give

227
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,029
it back to you but in the meantime it

228
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,209
has better uses for your money than you

229
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:42,059
do so there is gyro and as you can see

230
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:44,910
these are different characteristics of

231
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:48,329
money and I think it is important to

232
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:51,449
keep that in mind because we're talking

233
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:54,000
about cryptocurrencies we usually don't

234
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:57,149
make separation of function we say we

235
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,850
want to have one system that implements

236
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:02,759
all the possible functions of money and

237
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,389
all the types of money in one single

238
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:10,139
system and that makes design really

239
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:12,540
complicated but what you could instead

240
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,809
do is a half a movement between

241
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,839
functions so instead of saying I have a

242
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:21,959
system that is optimized for everything

243
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:25,110
you have multiple systems that interlink

244
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:28,050
and say I have this system that is good

245
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:32,339
for storage and this system is great for

246
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:34,620
anonymous sub-second payments anybody of

247
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:40,110
you having done a sub-second payment

248
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:45,380
recently on what

249
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:48,720
okay thank you confirmation thank you

250
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,510
so as I said before most blocks and

251
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,100
currencies today are focusing on the

252
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,470
storage part and not on the transfer

253
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,640
part what I would like to do is go back

254
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:03,750
in history to something called a DBC who

255
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:08,370
of you has ever heard that term DBC so

256
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,480
we have exactly 10 people under M over

257
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:13,560
40 here thank you

258
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,630
so imagine that before we have

259
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,010
blockchains

260
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,110
cryptic anarchists and cypherpunks were

261
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:22,370
actually thinking about different kinds

262
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:25,530
of digital money and one fundamental

263
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:28,890
solution they came up worse was the DBC

264
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:31,589
the what the is that it's a digital

265
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,300
bearer certificate now bearer

266
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,670
certificates are something you know from

267
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,459
bang well bankers know from banking you

268
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:41,250
know is where you have an authority that

269
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:45,630
certifies certain properties like value

270
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:49,830
or currency or expiration day or similar

271
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:54,560
now we can have those certificates in a

272
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:57,360
way that are digital and that are

273
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,109
cryptographic it's basically like a

274
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,450
check if the non-us people don't know

275
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:07,080
what a check is that's a piece of paper

276
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:09,360
that says if you hand this slip of paper

277
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,000
in the bank gives you 100 euros from my

278
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,070
bank account so that is basically what

279
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,480
that is it's a digital form of cheque so

280
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:21,720
these DB C's are really simple they have

281
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,490
a few functions only so the base

282
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,720
function is you have to create those

283
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:30,480
TBC's that's issuing then you have to be

284
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,510
able to spend them you know that means

285
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,240
they're not valid anymore and then there

286
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,819
are certain overlay functions you know

287
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,950
if you have a DB C for 10 euros you

288
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,770
might want to change it into 2 DB C's

289
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:46,620
for five years of stuff like that so as

290
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,480
you can see there are only two core

291
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,030
functions and operating in such a

292
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,839
systems so the question is how to search

293
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:59,010
your system work in detail

294
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:01,410
you have a string of data you know bits

295
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:03,300
and bytes and they represent nothing

296
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,620
else but the properties of the

297
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:10,890
certificate they say this is 10 years

298
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:15,540
owned by smuggler or 1 million euros

299
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:17,670
owned by smuggler and you have an

300
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,920
authority that signs that the authority

301
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,560
is whoever claims that they will give

302
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,810
you back the money and it's a digital

303
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,939
signature sounds trivial enough and it

304
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,829
comes with problems of course everything

305
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,070
comes as problems so what happens in the

306
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:37,440
digital world in the digital world you

307
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,480
never steal things really you only copy

308
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,120
them you know but if you have something

309
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,480
that contains value and you copy it it

310
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,630
becomes theft so what happens if I have

311
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,240
a certificate that says that the issuer

312
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:54,720
owns owes me 100 you know 1 million

313
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,550
euros and I make a copy of that and I go

314
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,830
back to the issue and say hey I have

315
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:02,300
like these two things you know each of

316
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:06,089
them says you give me 1 million euros

317
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:08,040
that is the issue of double spent and I

318
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:11,910
recently read an article about Bitcoin

319
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:16,140
saying Bitcoin was the first time double

320
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:18,029
spend was solved no it wasn't I'll come

321
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,189
back to that later then you have the

322
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:22,439
issue of privacy you know you have this

323
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:26,130
string of bits with a signature behind

324
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,770
it it's issued as digital of course it's

325
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,070
trackable you know I memorize what I

326
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:34,529
gave you attach your name to it you know

327
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,470
and half this record ok whoever comes

328
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:40,500
back to me who is this certificate got

329
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,959
the certificate from a so I have a trace

330
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,870
of what you're doing whom you're paying

331
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,930
and then the third issue and that is

332
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:52,920
issue a fraud issue a fraud means the

333
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:56,040
issuer claims are issues more money that

334
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:00,120
it has any justification for it events

335
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,699
money out of thin air and I would say

336
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,449
that out of these three problems that

337
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,310
mostly exists everywhere Bitcoin was the

338
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,420
first one

339
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:13,579
that solves the third issue in a

340
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:18,170
distributed decentralized manner but

341
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:20,389
there are other solutions double spent

342
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,700
how do you prevent against double spend

343
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,170
it's really easy you just memorize what

344
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,540
you've already spent there's the same

345
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,970
thing that Bitcoin does you know you

346
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,730
have a transaction that refers to an

347
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:34,760
unspent output of a transaction your

348
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:37,340
market is spent and then nobody else can

349
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,440
spend it there's no reason why you can't

350
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,899
do that with any simple database you

351
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,510
know just record the DBC that you

352
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,210
received say it has been spent you know

353
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:51,140
and in the future I'll never recognize

354
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,580
that DBC again super trivial I don't

355
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:57,200
have to go through the details here

356
00:17:52,580 --> 00:18:00,620
right so second thing privacy this is

357
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,370
really interesting so privacy in a

358
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:07,629
payment system should actually mean that

359
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:10,100
when I get money from somebody that

360
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:13,370
somebody doesn't know that I got money

361
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,590
or at least no third party does and when

362
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,810
I spend it to somebody else when I sent

363
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,550
somebody else the money that other party

364
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,260
shouldn't be able to prove to anybody

365
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:23,990
that it came from me

366
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:27,260
nor should a third party be able to to

367
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:31,970
see that transaction and in DBC systems

368
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:36,320
that is relatively easy because we had a

369
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:38,870
dude called David Shum who sadly didn't

370
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,750
speak at this conference who said hey we

371
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:45,080
can build this system you know DB C's

372
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:48,800
digital bear certificates but we do them

373
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:51,260
with blind signatures blind signatures

374
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,180
are magic because blind signatures mean

375
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,240
you can have a cryptographic signature

376
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:59,120
and something but they dude who signs it

377
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,820
doesn't know what is signed you cannot

378
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,310
know that and actually what you really

379
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,129
want is a blind and unlink able

380
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:10,399
signature because unlink above means he

381
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:12,860
can't even say oh yeah I have the signed

382
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,440
certificate and they're somewhere in the

383
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:19,310
past I had the signing event and they

384
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,380
two belong together a blind unlink able

385
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,780
signature

386
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,410
allows you to make a signature and never

387
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:29,350
be able to put the signing event and the

388
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,000
signed message together again ever and

389
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:36,039
that is cryptographically provable

390
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,610
actually so this comes with an issue if

391
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:41,950
I'm issuing this certificate and I don't

392
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,110
know what the certificate says then

393
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,720
anybody can just you know come by and

394
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:50,918
say hey sign this thing please you know

395
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:54,309
and how do I know if it's worth 10 years

396
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:56,289
or a million years I don't because I as

397
00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:00,158
a signer cannot actually know what I

398
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:04,480
sign now there have been multiple

399
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:07,120
approaches to you combat that kind of

400
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:12,480
fraud you know where the user basically

401
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:14,918
tries to betray the bank the most famous

402
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,190
protocol for using that is actually by

403
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:21,820
David Ronn he deserves a little bit of a

404
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:24,669
shout out for all of this and his

405
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:27,879
approach his first approach was you know

406
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:31,720
what instead of doing this signature

407
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,169
once or you know sending this blind

408
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,809
message to the bank once instead the

409
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:41,409
user should send a thousand of those and

410
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:46,210
then the bank says hey reveal the actual

411
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:49,299
clear text of those messages in 999

412
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:52,720
cases and if they are all true then I

413
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:55,629
will sign the last one it's a

414
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,679
probabilistic approach and it requires

415
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:02,830
that if you recover if you discover that

416
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,890
a user is trying to defraud you you have

417
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,740
to punish him so that means that the

418
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:12,250
first DBC systems were actually account

419
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:15,130
linked so people had an account with an

420
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:19,299
issuer then we would withdraw money from

421
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:21,070
that account to advc and wild

422
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:23,590
withdrawing they will make this proof

423
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,139
that whatever there was a reverse verb

424
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,678
is drawing was actually honest and if it

425
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,790
wasn't the bank would punish them by

426
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,220
subtracting money from their account

427
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:36,490
this is not a very efficient

428
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,530
solution and it's something where you

429
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,929
cannot escape fraud completely there

430
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,879
have been other approaches I'm not going

431
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:44,980
to get into them because I'm going to

432
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,669
get into the one that I like most

433
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,980
because it's trivial and that is simply

434
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:53,679
distinguished properties like valuing

435
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:57,370
currency by signing key instead of

436
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,860
signing random statements of this much

437
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,399
is what I own make a signature that says

438
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,850
I owe you a hundred years and I'm Bank

439
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,100
whatever that doesn't require any

440
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,620
probabilistic reveal it doesn't require

441
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:15,219
any proofs it's really simple it's one

442
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:18,699
easy transaction I talked to the issuer

443
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,179
the issuer makes a signature I get it

444
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,710
back

445
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:27,970
i unblinded I have money so this is the

446
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:31,059
solution that I like most but then

447
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,690
there's this little issue that all the

448
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,450
DVCC

449
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:37,900
systems we had in the past were run by a

450
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:42,700
single party because blind signatures

451
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:45,820
have a few problems one of them is we

452
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,429
don't know about any scheme to have

453
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:51,610
accumulative digital's blind signatures

454
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:54,340
that are unlink able and efficient we

455
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,469
don't have the crypto for it yet there

456
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:00,908
are thoughts about that when it comes to

457
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:02,950
very OSA it exotic encryption but people

458
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:05,650
dealing with an encryption don't like

459
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,480
the term exotic encryption it's usually

460
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:14,440
the stuff that it gets broken by a

461
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:17,440
teenager ten years later so we have

462
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:22,330
always have this issue or had this issue

463
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,880
that a bank could invent money we don't

464
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,059
want that we don't want the man at the

465
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,720
bank to say oh you know what I have this

466
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:33,370
hidden stash of unlimited money because

467
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,280
they're gonna just make a few more

468
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:40,418
signatures and invent money it's not in

469
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:44,289
our interest now I'm involved with a

470
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:47,800
little group of people in Berlin we have

471
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:49,870
this little thing container TAC

472
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,780
where we're trying to build a place that

473
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,929
Earth's resistance against surveillance

474
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,110
where we can experiment with things and

475
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:01,500
we had an issue there and that is we're

476
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:04,510
installing toilets I know it's a heavy

477
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,550
technology there and because it's so

478
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:09,040
expensive and complicated of course we

479
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:13,659
cannot have free toilets you have to pay

480
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:15,750
for taking a you know a dump because of

481
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,520
you know you have to to manage the

482
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,550
storage capacity of the tanks you know

483
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:25,060
you have to pay the people that pay for

484
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:26,830
that clean the toilets so we're in front

485
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,409
of this issue and saying okay how do we

486
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:31,540
solve that and the result of that was a

487
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:35,440
completely over engineered solution as

488
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:38,020
usual and that is a distributed blind

489
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,260
signature digital beer certificate

490
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:45,300
system that can do things like 2,000

491
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:50,200
transactions on a laptop in a second

492
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:55,870
thank you okay and I'll go a little bit

493
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:58,300
into the techno techno cavities so this

494
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,679
is basically for all those people who

495
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,050
are interested in a little bit of

496
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,350
nanotech and it's a demonstration of

497
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:10,330
simplicity and triviality so how do we

498
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:13,959
record spend certificates and how do

499
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:17,679
transactions look like so in our system

500
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:21,370
a transaction consists of a valid DBC

501
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,490
which would use to pay it might consist

502
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:30,100
of a return that you want to have

503
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:32,050
another DBC it contains an owner proof

504
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,600
you know you want to have money there

505
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:37,930
only belongs to you so you sign your

506
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,449
money and say okay this is my money and

507
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:43,090
it contains all the signatures of the

508
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:45,790
issuers and some parameters that are not

509
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:48,340
that important but all these things

510
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:50,260
basically make one transaction the

511
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,439
transaction is relatively small as a few

512
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,320
hundred bytes and the thing we do is we

513
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,560
record a hash of that transaction link

514
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,330
the unique parameters to it that is line

515
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,260
two and three

516
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:06,389
and out of that you get a database that

517
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,890
allows you to replay transactions

518
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:11,610
whenever you see the same transaction

519
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:13,680
it's endemic event meaning you create a

520
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,659
transaction once you send it to the

521
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,580
system if the system is down it doesn't

522
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,080
matter you just repeat and you can

523
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,840
actually repeat it as often as you want

524
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,710
you always get the same result if the

525
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:28,860
money is spent together haha no money

526
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:32,360
and if you're actually doing in exchange

527
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:34,709
you get the same signed certificate back

528
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,479
which means that you don't have to keep

529
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,790
much state on the client you have to

530
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,890
know synchronization between the client

531
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,600
and the servers you don't have any

532
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,670
synchronization between the servers and

533
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,649
you really don't care if the internet

534
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:52,290
works at that moment or not signing

535
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:55,890
so signing is as a set an issue blind

536
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:58,379
signatures distributed over many blind

537
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:01,050
signatures over many issuers is a kind

538
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,810
of unsolved issue so we turned it around

539
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:08,310
and said you know what instead of having

540
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:11,580
one signature that one issuer does we

541
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:14,669
have many issues they simply do the same

542
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,929
signature their own signatures on the

543
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:21,690
same data so instead of having your

544
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:24,090
properties and one signature you have

545
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,610
your properties and a lot of signatures

546
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,800
and those signatures simply come from

547
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,959
different parties and what you can do

548
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,450
with that is you can build a system that

549
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,640
is widely distributed that is completely

550
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,710
untraceable and that is totally trivial

551
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,070
because it only has those two rules on

552
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:46,130
how to sign something so you sign the

553
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,129
DVC either if you've never seen it or

554
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,400
you know the hash of the complete

555
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,170
transaction that is what I was saying

556
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:59,940
before and you have signed the inputs

557
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:04,050
yourself or a quorum of all other issues

558
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,480
issuers has signed this transaction just

559
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:10,649
think about those two rules or those two

560
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,380
rules mean is that you cannot make any

561
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:16,320
transaction in this system unless

562
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:20,640
a forum of all participants in the

563
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:23,639
system signers in this system agree but

564
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,650
this also means that all those signing

565
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,830
parties in the system actually don't

566
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,850
have to talk with each other the whole

567
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,210
synchronisation in the system just

568
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:35,159
happens by the user making a transaction

569
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:37,110
no Bank has to talk to another Bank

570
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,340
no issuer has to talk with another issue

571
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:43,199
the only thing that you do is you define

572
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,480
two little rules and you have one client

573
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,110
that by his action synchronizes all

574
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,890
issuers

575
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:52,080
if a few of those issuers are down it

576
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,770
doesn't matter you can just replay the

577
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,980
transaction as I said before it impudent

578
00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:00,990
transactions you just repeat and the

579
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,110
only interesting part there is that you

580
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,480
have to set the quorum high enough so if

581
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,699
you will set the quorum under fifty

582
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,610
percent then people could start

583
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:16,350
inventing money but if you said it high

584
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:19,709
enough you can actually guarantee that

585
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:22,408
you have to have a decision an almost

586
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:25,710
democratic decision by all issuers for

587
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:29,429
anything not just a transaction itself

588
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:31,919
but also for inventing money in this

589
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:35,309
system no single party can just say I'm

590
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,470
gonna make money out of thin air but

591
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:45,178
instead the parties have to come

592
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:48,059
together and decide on creating money so

593
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:52,470
a few properties of that system and I'm

594
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:54,840
trying to keep it short here so I said

595
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,730
the first few things already there's a

596
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,199
third thing that is kind of always

597
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,240
important you know we often design

598
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,900
systems and then we think about

599
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:07,500
governance and since we're really lazy

600
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:10,039
in our work we just took a technology

601
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:14,280
there was already about handling forums

602
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:17,158
it's actually about auditing code but

603
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,730
hey what the hell you know so we used

604
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,530
code chained by our beloved frank brown

605
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,510
tree organized the whole system of

606
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:27,210
issuers then the second thing that

607
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:31,350
should be mentioned is my laptop which

608
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:34,169
as a three four five year old ThinkPad

609
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:39,120
makes about 2,000 transactions as an

610
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:41,610
issuer in this system per second and the

611
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:46,500
only limiting factor other than

612
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:50,149
processing is latency so if you're able

613
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:53,970
to connect to one of those mins with 50

614
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:57,570
milliseconds latency like how long does

615
00:30:53,970 --> 00:31:01,500
it take to talk to you a transaction

616
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:05,840
will take 150 milliseconds translate

617
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:08,370
that globally the global median for

618
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,799
latency on the Internet is 250

619
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,779
milliseconds so if all the issuers are

620
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,240
distributed equally over the whole globe

621
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:17,940
by licensee you actually have a

622
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,740
transaction in 750 milliseconds and it's

623
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:25,350
completely settled and co-signed by a

624
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:28,559
lot of parties it is extremely cheap we

625
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:31,770
don't have to store a lot of data the

626
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:36,299
only thing we kind of store is those 280

627
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:38,520
bytes per DBC and the storage of these

628
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:41,149
280 bytes is relatively interesting

629
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:44,520
because it's linearly sale is scaleable

630
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:47,719
exactly as designing operations itself

631
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,860
so you can work with clusters it's

632
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,230
relatively trivial distributed

633
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:55,260
programming and it allows you to use

634
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,210
extremely cheap storage technology we

635
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:00,539
don't need anything there has fast

636
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:04,860
access we can use probabilistic data

637
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:08,580
structures to find values and this means

638
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:12,570
that billions of transactions can be

639
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:18,000
done still by my laptop it's really

640
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:20,480
efficient so a normal DB C is about a

641
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,570
hundred and twenty eight bytes long and

642
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,120
then every signer in that system adds

643
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,760
about thirty three bytes so that means

644
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,620
that if you have a thousand signers in

645
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,889
there such a system you still are around

646
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:40,439
3.3 kilobytes for transaction meaning

647
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,070
that two packages can contain the whole

648
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,810
transaction

649
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:46,040
they have thousand independent parties

650
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:50,100
making sure that your system still works

651
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:53,940
then it is completely anonymous blind

652
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:57,179
signatures and linkable blind signatures

653
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:00,000
mean that nobody knows what happens to

654
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,070
whatever certificate you receive from

655
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,380
the system you can send it to another

656
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:06,840
party the party cannot link it to the

657
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,010
signing event the issuers cannot link it

658
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,409
to the signing at hand

659
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,000
event is completely untraceable and the

660
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:15,840
interesting thing is that the anonymity

661
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,670
said there is really big in most systems

662
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,250
we are using on blockchain right now the

663
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:24,480
anonymity said for most transactions is

664
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:28,440
relatively limited it's often extremely

665
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,800
limited so it might be only a selection

666
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,770
of a few alternative users of the system

667
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,870
like Manero where you have a handful of

668
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,960
alternative users that could be

669
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:42,510
responsible for your transaction in a

670
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,910
lot of cases the anonymity set is not

671
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:47,910
much bigger than the number of

672
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:51,420
transactions in the block in our case

673
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:54,780
the anonymity set of each transaction is

674
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:57,000
as big as all transactions in the key

675
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,980
lifetime of the signer which can be

676
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,320
months which can be billions of

677
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,520
transactions depending on use ok nobody

678
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,520
goes through the toilet that much but

679
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:10,469
you have an anonymity set that is

680
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,530
extremely high and the key lifetime is

681
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:18,330
only defined by how long do I want to

682
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:23,030
store data as an issue if if I have a

683
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:25,440
lot of storage I might be able to do

684
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,120
1,000 transactions per day

685
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,300
for every person on this planet and

686
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:35,279
still do it for a whole year with my

687
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:38,010
laptop I can get two laptops and then I

688
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,600
have an anonymity set of two years I can

689
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,419
do it with four letters and so on you

690
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,860
you get the point right so and then

691
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:46,109
there's a nice little feature of those

692
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:49,980
systems that is their half offline

693
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:51,540
capable half offline capable means it

694
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,280
doesn't require both parties to be

695
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,570
online to actually know that a

696
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,470
transaction is what

697
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:59,750
a valid and can be settled immediately

698
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,310
specifically this allows you to have

699
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,340
point-of-sale terminals that don't have

700
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:07,470
to be connected to the Internet at all

701
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,630
you basically get a payment you can

702
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,149
verify the payment locally immediately

703
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:14,790
because it's just a signature

704
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:16,859
verification plus have you seen that DBC

705
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,619
yourself before and does it have certain

706
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:23,069
properties and that's it and then do you

707
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:26,640
know that you've got a valid payment so

708
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:29,970
you're not reliant on dust the Wi-Fi at

709
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,580
HTTP work but instead you just

710
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:35,459
distribute your point-of-sale terminals

711
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:37,350
in your store you receive payments and

712
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,420
then at the end of the day you might

713
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:41,490
synchronize them to the network or maybe

714
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:45,480
a day later or a day later or a day

715
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:48,270
later so it works in Reverse by the way

716
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,990
as well you can actually use the system

717
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:54,540
with wallets that never go online they

718
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:57,830
only receive data and they make payments

719
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:00,690
but they never have to be online which

720
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:04,529
brings us through the future and the

721
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:06,330
super cheap hardware wallets remember

722
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:08,820
these are all strings with a few

723
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,560
signatures and you only have to verify

724
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,660
them when you get them not when you

725
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,080
spent them you actually don't have to do

726
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,210
any calculations to make a payment with

727
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:22,350
this system only when you receive money

728
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:24,840
which allows you to basically have a USB

729
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:27,270
storage stick as your Hardware wallet

730
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,010
it's just files that you have to store

731
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,710
the only thing you have to make sure

732
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:33,810
when you make a payment is that you

733
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:36,720
select the right files to transfer to

734
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:38,880
the point-of-sale terminal which means

735
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,189
that you could have a hardware wallet

736
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,790
for physical payment for something like

737
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:46,710
five US dollars and it still be secure

738
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:49,529
now what's coming is exactly that we

739
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:52,650
haven't worked too much on Hardware

740
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:55,530
wallet yet another thing that we're

741
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:58,800
working on is the ability to have atomic

742
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:01,320
swaps between this system and Bitcoin so

743
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,960
you can transfer money between Bitcoin

744
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:07,440
and this system without developing a

745
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,220
third party and without complication

746
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,410
there's

747
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:14,009
thing to add to that and that is we're

748
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:16,470
not 100% sure where this is going

749
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,450
as I said before it's an over engineered

750
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:23,399
solution for paying for going to the

751
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:26,160
toilet then we have this little thing

752
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,880
that's called DBC swaps which allow you

753
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,730
to have secure transactions between

754
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:36,150
multiple currencies in latency time

755
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:39,570
which allows you to have TBC's like take

756
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,080
a or use the Wi-Fi or pay for a

757
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,910
drink

758
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,819
you have different currencies for that

759
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:47,180
you can swap them automatically on in

760
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,790
the system and then there's another

761
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:52,379
slightly out there thing which we

762
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,990
thought about mostly because we thought

763
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,060
it's cool and that is you can have a

764
00:37:54,990 --> 00:38:00,089
distributed system as your own wallet

765
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,830
you know you just take a few raspberry

766
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,859
PI's you distribute them over the world

767
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:07,500
and they basically make sure that your

768
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:09,150
money is safe and accessible they just

769
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,700
talk to the system all the time and they

770
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:14,940
don't need privileges because none of

771
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,680
those little raspberry PI's ever has

772
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,680
enough information to steal your money

773
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,730
so you can't host that actually in a

774
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,500
park if you want to then there's this

775
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:28,950
distributed secret smart contracts which

776
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:33,480
is based on the same thing since you

777
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:36,629
have these these little strings of

778
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:40,609
signatures of sets of signatures you can

779
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:43,320
cut that in part and say okay every

780
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:45,180
participant only gets one signature it

781
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,960
doesn't get quorum amount of signatures

782
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:52,410
you just attach a little bit code to it

783
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,720
you know to do reissues and if all those

784
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:57,149
instances where you run the code with

785
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,040
one of those signatures agrees then you

786
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,560
have a transaction if not they're not

787
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,210
that is basically a very simple smart

788
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,330
contract that doesn't have to run on the

789
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:08,190
blockchain at all and now about if you

790
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:14,119
have five minutes and I kind of just

791
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:14,119
want to I have five minutes so three I

792
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,570
told you that I'm coming from an

793
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:20,910
alternative reality and I'm done with

794
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,080
script so far I kind of want to take you

795
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:26,279
one step in this issue

796
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:28,680
and that is in the olden days one of the

797
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,150
things the sirens talked about was how

798
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,970
do we actually build hardware they're

799
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:35,280
distrustful you know all these things we

800
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:38,430
do with block chains whatever our we're

801
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,130
doing because we don't trust anybody and

802
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:44,850
we cannot trust anybody but what if we

803
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:47,880
could trust our computers in that so

804
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:50,400
that is actually a question that is a

805
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,380
mainstream now and it's not mainstream

806
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,710
for blocking currencies it's mainstream

807
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,780
for cloud computing you want to make

808
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:00,510
sure that the code you're running in the

809
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,640
cloud is only accessible by you not by

810
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:05,010
the cloud provider and so on and so and

811
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,170
this has led to a lot of development in

812
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,790
the last few years

813
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:11,880
anonymous attestation encrypted DRAM and

814
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:13,890
verifiable softer imagined you can trust

815
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,720
your computer so what is remote

816
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:18,750
attestation remote attestation only

817
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,419
means that through the internet I can

818
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:24,720
ask a different computer and say are you

819
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:27,210
a computer and can I trust you and this

820
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,759
computer can answer it can say yes I am

821
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:33,960
and I can prove it that's a short

822
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,960
version of it now combine that with RAM

823
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,420
that has encrypted you cannot listen to

824
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,420
the RAM anymore you have this black box

825
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,340
computer and you go there physically and

826
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,020
you want to steal it secrets and you

827
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,350
can't because the RAM is encrypted damn

828
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,220
it

829
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:51,870
so the third thing is verifiable

830
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:55,109
software that's the thing I have no clue

831
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:58,290
about but in theory it says that you can

832
00:40:55,110 --> 00:41:01,020
prove that a certain implementation of a

833
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:03,300
software is the same as a specification

834
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:06,420
for the software that software is doing

835
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:11,820
exactly and nothing else than what the

836
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:14,040
specifications has no back doors what

837
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,950
does that mean that means that we could

838
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,509
in theory go ahead and say ok each one

839
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:21,569
of us has a little bit of a computer

840
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:25,020
black box we put it into her homes and

841
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:28,020
we run whatever software we want on it

842
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:30,150
and prove that only this software works

843
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:33,060
we don't have to jump through many hoops

844
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:35,130
to make it and trustworthy but instead

845
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,730
we can say that the computer itself and

846
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,520
this off

847
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:41,280
is trustworthy and we might get there

848
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:45,480
and that means that all the effort we do

849
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:49,079
with blockchains and with scrit might

850
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,630
actually be a waste of time in ten years

851
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:55,890
if our computers actually become

852
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:59,520
trustworthy then we might run any kind

853
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:01,109
of software secretly mobile quickly on

854
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,140
every computer and the only thing you

855
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:07,130
need script for them is to pay for it

856
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,129
thank you

857
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:21,770
thank you smuggler amazing talk as usual

858
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:25,820
one question I did not really understand

859
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:28,160
well you have a federation of issuers at

860
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,990
the beginning right you said a quorum of

861
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,850
eight of ten so I would say we have ten

862
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:34,520
of them how do you want to distribute

863
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:36,200
the initial keys or is that something

864
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:41,420
that you there's no initial key

865
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:43,640
distribution yeah okay and it's a

866
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,400
complex system I have tried to put into

867
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:49,069
thirty minutes you know okay so there's

868
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,410
no key distribution the only thing that

869
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:54,140
every instant does is create its own

870
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:57,470
keys and it's used for signing and the

871
00:42:54,140 --> 00:43:00,560
the only coordination issue do you have

872
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:02,689
to do once is to say who starts the

873
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,500
whole process you know who are the first

874
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:08,450
ten users that run such a system that's

875
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,280
a government question governance

876
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,569
question not government and that we

877
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,790
don't want the government in here

878
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:19,280
governance question anybody say the

879
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:21,200
original idea that the second original

880
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,110
idea we had the first original idea was

881
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,390
that every member in our local community

882
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:28,670
just runs an issuer you know and we

883
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:31,160
together control the profit from the

884
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:34,300
toilets and then we thought that

885
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:37,540
actually the better thing would be to

886
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:39,920
invite all the different hackerspaces

887
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,340
parallely polish peril and nopales

888
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,720
whatever to become an issuer itself and

889
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:48,920
participate in the issue and then become

890
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,990
a decentralized central bank really

891
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,540
fascinating questions please we have

892
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:55,370
about 20 minutes okay I'll start from

893
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,880
left because I'm sure max has been

894
00:43:55,370 --> 00:44:00,890
thinking a lot during the presentation I

895
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,860
kind of to pick up or Delana ask is the

896
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:07,400
addition of a new DBC server the same as

897
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:10,090
a key rotation and hashtag no it's not a

898
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,430
key rotation it's a vote on a new

899
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:16,970
contributor so existing systems

900
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:19,700
basically accept new systems yes okay

901
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:23,120
that's the same concept as in hashed the

902
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:26,180
the whole governance is he's responsible

903
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,440
for that yeah but it's coaching it's in

904
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,339
coaching and then how do you use the

905
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,000
single source of truth

906
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:33,810
utilized in coaching

907
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,450
the same thing you create the chain the

908
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:40,859
governance chain so to speak you publish

909
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:43,379
it it's in DNS and whatever and whoever

910
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:45,930
wants to use the system just downloads

911
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:49,890
the code chain verifies it three and

912
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:54,060
that's it did you say can you say I

913
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:56,129
love you said thank you for an

914
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,920
absolutely fascinating talk and my

915
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:01,650
question is conceptual okay so with fiat

916
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,150
currencies you get like you have the

917
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,280
government declares you have fiat

918
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:08,550
currency I made it so let there be light

919
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,859
right here so it seems to me you have a

920
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:12,900
different system you said I'm smuggler

921
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:16,319
I'll have a cartel of digital central

922
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:20,160
banks let there be light I say so there

923
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:22,590
is DVCS right problem is you still have

924
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,100
the Genesis moment right and I haven't

925
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,320
asked you

926
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,509
yeah that's my question why should I

927
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:32,880
trust you you shouldn't you shouldn't

928
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:38,400
you shouldn't say the this system is

929
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:43,830
basically the the front layer it doesn't

930
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:47,730
define how the Genesis exists it's open

931
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:49,740
to multiple stories so for us when we

932
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:51,510
started the whole thing it was about 10

933
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:54,209
dudes knowing each other and wanting to

934
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:57,090
run in a toilet you know so that's how

935
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,320
we started so and then you have this

936
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,690
thing with hackerspaces

937
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,210
you know it's our community there's a

938
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:06,480
certain form of implicit trust in the

939
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:09,750
community as a whole even if you don't

940
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,820
trust a single node in the community say

941
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:15,240
the whole question of Genesis is

942
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:17,070
undefined you take the system you apply

943
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,459
it to a social situation that you have

944
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:23,760
and that's it however nobody stops you

945
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:25,380
from creating a protocol that selects

946
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,570
you becomes part of it and that is

947
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,550
actually very de crazy easy part comes

948
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,430
into play

949
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:37,220
imagine you have actually trustworthy

950
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:40,200
systems and you can do stuff like

951
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:43,410
multi-party key generation on them that

952
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,299
means that you spit that system

953
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:48,000
into the world you know people just buy

954
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:48,839
there are processors they're actually

955
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,029
able to do that

956
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:52,710
like am the epic you can use for that

957
00:46:51,029 --> 00:46:55,319
it's a little bit expensive that it

958
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,880
works and it means you have just a

959
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:58,859
computer you connect to the internet you

960
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,569
download the software once and then you

961
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:02,640
make a random coin flip if you become a

962
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:06,119
member or not and it's still trustworthy

963
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:11,940
and then you have whatever algorithmic

964
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:15,170
scheme you want for money creation going

965
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,339
back to the core room you said that

966
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,349
actually is there a first question is

967
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:22,140
that a peer-to-peer protocol involved or

968
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:25,289
I have to ask a client connect directly

969
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:28,890
to a signer or all of the signers you're

970
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:30,990
actually say the the the base protocol

971
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:33,420
requires you to speak to all the signers

972
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:36,740
and the list of sinus is part of the

973
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:39,450
definition of the software

974
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:41,640
there's optimization that you can do and

975
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:44,009
that is you can have a fan-out pattern

976
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,930
meaning you talk to one signer and the

977
00:47:44,009 --> 00:47:47,609
signer fans out the other parts of the

978
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,890
transaction to others that's why the

979
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:52,049
transaction are constructed at the S

980
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:53,900
they are because you can have one

981
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:57,960
transaction then it can be split off

982
00:47:53,900 --> 00:48:00,809
split into parts by any untrusted party

983
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,210
and just send it around so you can

984
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:05,220
actually minimize the amount of traffic

985
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:08,910
that you have to generate as a client

986
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:10,589
and then rely on untrusted parties on

987
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:12,118
the net to split it to the rest of the

988
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:15,569
network so yeah there's still a bit of a

989
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:17,700
protocol involved it's not necessarily

990
00:48:15,569 --> 00:48:20,819
peer-to-peer protocol because it's a

991
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:24,118
signers know the signers never talk to

992
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:26,400
each other okay though and with one

993
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:28,470
exception if they vote on create my

994
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,359
creating money they have to you know say

995
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,740
oh let's create money you know that's

996
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:34,109
the only moment they actually have to

997
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,879
talk with each other there's a moment

998
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:39,000
that you can add if you really want to

999
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:42,089
and that is all these signers are

1000
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,049
actually auditable you can actually show

1001
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:48,660
that the the money in circulation in a

1002
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:50,519
system like that is actually as expected

1003
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,589
and if you want to do that they have to

1004
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:54,149
talk with each other as well but within

1005
00:48:52,589 --> 00:48:56,359
operation they never talk with each

1006
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,359
other

1007
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:00,690
Alice and Bob are pizza stores across

1008
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:02,640
the street from each other but they're

1009
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,120
disconnected by internet karo has the

1010
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,980
DBC

1011
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:09,600
goes to Bob and tries to pay twice and

1012
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:13,740
the bloom they both have the same bloom

1013
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:15,600
filter so Carl uh sigh Bob knows okay

1014
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:19,620
you paid twice it's not a double payment

1015
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:21,930
Carl and the DBC is copied I'm into Bob

1016
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,700
so that way Bob knows that it's been

1017
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:26,490
paid Carl walks across the street to

1018
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:30,779
Alice and Alice and Bob are disconnected

1019
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:32,250
attempts to copy that DBC to Alice Alice

1020
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,400
has the bloom filter but doesn't have

1021
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:38,340
any update from Alice what happens you

1022
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,710
have to encode the owner into the BBC

1023
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,900
itself so when you make a transaction to

1024
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,180
somebody one of the options you have

1025
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,550
it's not necessary that you do it but

1026
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:50,430
for your case you know very have offline

1027
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:52,950
receivers you basically get the identity

1028
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,230
of the receiver and code it into the DBC

1029
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:57,299
make the transaction and then the

1030
00:49:55,230 --> 00:50:02,250
receiver only has to say okay have I

1031
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:04,440
seen this DBC before if not and you have

1032
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,300
enough signatures that are valid then

1033
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:11,910
the transaction can be related to the

1034
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:14,580
network and any future time and you can

1035
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:16,730
of course make the owner assignment in a

1036
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:21,420
way this is untraceable and as trivial

1037
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:22,860
the last not question about comment yeah

1038
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,420
thanks for the great talk are gonna do

1039
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:27,840
the thing I hate when people do it just

1040
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:29,640
at something oh yeah please do um so we

1041
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,040
Frey blames you for everything so please

1042
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:36,480
okay first we start we're gonna get

1043
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,529
rich with this we decided that we have

1044
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,800
better things to do

1045
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:43,680
so we we're gonna release everything we

1046
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,910
have all the code everything we know

1047
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,190
about it

1048
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:49,080
and we would like this to you know

1049
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:51,630
happen and a lot of places like this

1050
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,549
here but we really would need some help

1051
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:55,530
with this yes specially with hardware

1052
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,360
because we really start with hardware

1053
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:00,030
yes is that it's really easy to do with

1054
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,770
USB sticks but we don't know how to wear

1055
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:04,800
and there's also some code to be written

1056
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:07,860
so just wanted to add that yeah it's

1057
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,390
really we decided I mean this really

1058
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,340
community thing and we

1059
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:13,290
look-the since we're just gonna float

1060
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:15,030
out there and I hope this alternative

1061
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,690
reality you know becomes an actual

1062
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:22,800
reality

1063
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:29,880
thanks again thank you thank you

1064
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:32,070
I have no better closing argument than

1065
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,750
drunk actually thank you very much

1066
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,760
smuggler it was a pleasure to have you

1067
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:44,809
again

1068
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:44,809
[Applause]
