00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:47,840
in California that was 1992 summer of

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,920
1992 in Malibu California so I actually

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,110
am a surfer don't do a lot of it anymore

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,869
I'm kind of land lock in Austria tell

32
00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:01,840
you about why that is so I was born in

33
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:07,579
1963 and until about 2015 I really

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:10,060
didn't give a about anything I'm uh

35
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:15,579
this is a disclaimer I'm a privileged

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:18,739
white guy from Malibu California I was

37
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:20,420
fourteen there and that's Sean Penn who

38
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,930
grew up across the street from me so

39
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:30,018
kind of like grow up in the whole brat

40
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:31,940
pack Malibu Hollywood thing so I'm just

41
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:34,519
gonna fast forward to 2009 when Bitcoin

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,940
arrived I had an interesting life up

43
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,940
until that point

44
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:44,010
it was just like one thing that was

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,709
happening it was just the latest

46
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,660
extension of bitgold and Liberty dollars

47
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,450
and all this stuff it was an interesting

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,510
paper I was one of those people who

49
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:57,510
didn't really think that that it would

50
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:01,140
work I just thought it would be co-opted

51
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,519
and shut down and and stuff so it's not

52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,559
really something that I paid really

53
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,810
close attention to but being involved in

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,820
in different hacker cultures and coda

55
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:13,050
cultures and stuff it was it was on the

56
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,549
plate I'm gonna fast-forward to the Arab

57
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,510
Spring happening because I was kind of

58
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:22,709
like a seminal point for me I came back

59
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:27,870
from Istanbul to to Austria in in 2009

60
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:31,920
and I was living in a in a farmhouse on

61
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:35,220
the Czech border with Austria with my

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,450
cat doing like classic sustainability

63
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,030
thing learning how to grow your own food

64
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,339
and just living in a village with 200

65
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:46,470
people with Vinay Gupta calls hippy on a

66
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:50,670
bicycle and online 1620 hours a day and

67
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,890
the Arab Spring happened so January 25th

68
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,910
everything went went crazy and Tarija

69
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,649
and this is a really great shot of a guy

70
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,940
just like jamming on though I really I

71
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,830
really loved that so this was one of the

72
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:07,380
first things I did for for the Arab

73
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:10,500
Spring and so January 28th was what they

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,769
called the Day of Rage and after what

75
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,810
happened in Tahrir and and so what

76
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,760
actually happened is American cyber

77
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,530
activists and people picked up on on

78
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,530
this idea of the Day of Rage and they

79
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,590
decided to a day of Rage in in in the

80
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,059
States and Day of Rage is what grew into

81
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,349
Occupy Wall Street that was the first

82
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,820
piece of art that I did for a walk by

83
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,430
Wall Street and things just sort of like

84
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,380
was exploding all of this social

85
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,020
activism all this politics all those

86
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,310
things were just completely intoxicating

87
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,130
for me as an artist just being online

88
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,979
and and things were happening and on

89
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,450
Twitter just like BAM and just grabbing

90
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:52,110
stuff and throwing it into Photoshop and

91
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,380
and doing things and so

92
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,270
WikiLeaks was a really interesting

93
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,850
interesting phenomenon Julian is an

94
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,190
interesting person groundbreaking and

95
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,770
what it is that he did and to our values

96
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,580
as a community and stuff and so I had a

97
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,229
lot of fun

98
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:12,359
re mixing WikiLeaks and of course a key

99
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,380
point of that is this is actually the

100
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,320
first time that I was here apparently

101
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:20,640
Pole is is that picture was doing the I

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,070
am Bradley Manning campaign and so these

103
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,900
things flew together and ended up kind

104
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,849
of like becoming because of my artwork

105
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,739
be like what you call a citizen

106
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,030
journalist and because I was doing this

107
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,850
art I got to meet all these interesting

108
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,989
people Daniel domscheit-berg and the

109
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,480
conflict that he was having with Julian

110
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,290
I didn't interview with him and then

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,419
Adrian lamo on drugs with his FBI

112
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,860
handler sitting in the room it's very

113
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,169
interesting to our interview that's on

114
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,410
Vimeo and James ball when he left

115
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:51,000
WikiLeaks and stuff so that was doing

116
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,210
the art really got me in touch with a

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,640
lot of interesting people so that went

118
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,969
into like the whole thing with anonymous

119
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,700
and and lowsec and and all these things

120
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,680
so they were hacking web pages and I was

121
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,419
when when they were doing their hacks I

122
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,280
was doing the artwork and participating

123
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,620
in the channels and stuff just a bunch

124
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,690
of online punk kids that were really fun

125
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,790
and and a lot of stuff all the stuff

126
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:20,760
happening in IRC and this was the point

127
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:23,340
at which that I took Bitcoin seriously

128
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,590
for the first point was when WikiLeaks

129
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,119
got blockaded by PayPal and that's when

130
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,390
the light bulb went off in my head like

131
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,330
oh okay this actually works so we were

132
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,690
all motivated to you know get money to

133
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:39,030
WikiLeaks to continue their work and so

134
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,090
that was the point at which became

135
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:44,130
Bitcoin became for me sort of like a

136
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,880
reality of something that actually had a

137
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:52,380
use case and being connected with the

138
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,780
political activism and and the financial

139
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,460
necessity of being able to be censorship

140
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,440
resistant and stuff so all of this stuff

141
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,090
ended up getting me censored in

142
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,900
government networks is my site

143
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,289
artificial eyes TV I get

144
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,840
I get a private message on Twitter one

145
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,490
day from a girl that was working in the

146
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,109
Navy that was that was a supporter of

147
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,960
WikiLeaks and told me hey I can't access

148
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,700
your site anymore I was like what so

149
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,440
that was kind of interesting and I kind

150
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:24,849
of sort of like considered a badge of

151
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:27,610
honor that being an artist that I was

152
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,810
censored it was you know pretty cool

153
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,030
thing for me actually

154
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:35,530
so after this point that Bitcoin became

155
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,669
more important for me got together with

156
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,710
Finnick and Michael Cole ski a couple

157
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,210
other freaks from Austria and we started

158
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,859
bitcoiners Without Borders it was kind

159
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:48,419
of like a logical thing Doctors Without

160
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:53,740
Borders Reporters Without Borders

161
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:55,870
bitcoiners Without Borders it was kind

162
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,780
of like inspired by the first Bitcoin

163
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,730
bar from York Platzer was the first

164
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,030
place that you could pay for a beer with

165
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:07,990
Bitcoin and he'll be here tomorrow I

166
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:10,119
guess and was also part of like our you

167
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,410
know like seminal sort of like crew of

168
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,340
people that were talking about these

169
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:18,400
things and so the first thing that we

170
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,219
did was this thing called crime me which

171
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,859
was QR code on coins so that we could

172
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:29,440
basically hand them to each other to pay

173
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:31,990
for beers and York's bar and went on it

174
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,640
had to do something they'll credit which

175
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,610
is essentially the same thing that we

176
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,850
got here on the badges now back in 2012

177
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:43,600
a form of that basically or a paper

178
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:48,850
wallet of course we were way too far

179
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,910
ahead of our time so then Mike when Ross

180
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,680
lebryk got arrested Mike was connected

181
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,050
with with Lynn will bricked somehow I

182
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,219
don't know how it was and he said hey

183
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,930
listen there's this guy that does this

184
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,970
mimetics and he's really connected with

185
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,359
with all these online communities maybe

186
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:10,480
he could do marketing for for free Ross

187
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:12,400
and so I was kind of like hmm about that

188
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,080
and I'll tell you later why about I was

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,280
I was sort of concerned about doing this

190
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,280
it's part of my story

191
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,420
and at the same time I was negotiating

192
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,030
with the Bitcoin foundation become their

193
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,439
system administrator and this is the

194
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,350
first time that actually got paid in

195
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,660
Bitcoin this is my first ever

196
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:34,010
transaction getting for for Bitcoin from

197
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:38,880
the Bitcoin foundation using multi-bit

198
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:40,950
really cool and so was really exciting

199
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,360
to like make this screenshot being

200
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,220
involved with this this groundbreaking

201
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,190
technology and being involved with this

202
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,720
organization that was model on the on

203
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,190
being something like Mozilla or whatever

204
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,020
and had all these high ideals and was

205
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,160
something really excited to be and be

206
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,340
involved with and it was just like a

207
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,890
logical progression of my political

208
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:03,870
activism was was becoming a financial

209
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:05,610
activist and that got me in touch with

210
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,450
this guy named Roger Baer also known as

211
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,820
Bitcoin Jesus so this is where I was

212
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:15,420
living on the Czech border and there was

213
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,430
this this cross here and I thought it

214
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,110
would be really really funny so I made

215
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,760
this Photoshop remix and I sent it to

216
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,360
Roger when I started working at the

217
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,770
Bitcoin foundation so Roger was one of

218
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,850
the original people that funded a lot of

219
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:33,870
stuff in the in the ecosystem and so I

220
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:37,350
guess I basically been living since 2013

221
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:45,920
on Bitcoin that came from Roger before

222
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:48,450
he did Bitcoin what's it called cash so

223
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,890
this sort of like became a full circle

224
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,540
for me because this is what I thought

225
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,189
Occupy Wall Street was about at the

226
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,160
beginning was just taking away this this

227
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:58,020
this dominant financial paradigm that

228
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,910
the banks are sitting on with fiat money

229
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:05,130
and and so it was essentially what what

230
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,480
Occupy Wall Street was saying is is hey

231
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,930
we need to take this out of the hands of

232
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,690
the bankers so while I was living there

233
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:17,280
on the border it was really great Edward

234
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:19,470
Snowden is flying to god-knows-where and

235
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,470
I'm this like citizen journalists guy

236
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,260
who gets to go on a 3G connection over

237
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,420
Skype and talk to RT while Snowden's

238
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,890
flying to who-knows-where and network

239
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,540
with forget Dion's doctor and the

240
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,410
different people who were helping to get

241
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,650
Snowden

242
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:38,490
into asylum and so it was kind of like

243
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:41,910
you know and it's like I'm a half Punk

244
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,230
half hippie kid from California who grew

245
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,390
up with the internet and went to school

246
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,080
went to university get my first email

247
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,340
account I have all my emails since 1982

248
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,020
I've been able to go through every

249
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,660
operating system every mail client I

250
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,949
have unbroken my email since since those

251
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:01,020
days and Here I am like you know on a

252
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,030
 Star Trek communicator like

253
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,860
doing an interview about a political

254
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,589
dissident

255
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,170
you know from this literally where I'm

256
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:13,830
standing there this is the border

257
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:16,979
between Austria and the Czech Republic

258
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,360
the old Iron Curtain and so I always

259
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,640
tried to put a lot of symbolism the

260
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,200
things that I did and and really sort of

261
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:28,650
like lived this stuff and so in 2015

262
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,350
I'm fell in love and decided to get

263
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:38,220
married in a wig because as you all know

264
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:42,750
I don't have hair and my passport was

265
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:46,340
expiring and so I had been living for

266
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,340
three years on the Czech border and

267
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,420
overstayed my Schengen visa requirements

268
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,870
by like two and a half years and I was

269
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,569
like okay can't really like you

270
00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:02,610
know apply for marriage and residency in

271
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:05,130
Austria with with a you know overstaying

272
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,990
my shank is and so I'm like cool I'm

273
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:10,170
gonna wash my passport and go and apply

274
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:12,710
for a new passport right so I go I do

275
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:16,620
that I go on apply for a new passport

276
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:19,920
and I go in to pick it up and there's

277
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,900
the consular officer standing there and

278
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,680
says sorry mr. brain we can't give you

279
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,250
your passport

280
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:30,030
blah blah blah explains to me why can

281
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:31,350
you sign this and I'm like okay if I

282
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,060
sign this gonna walk out of here and

283
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:38,190
they're like yeah and so I did that and

284
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,290
so you're probably all wondering or at

285
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:44,769
least I was wondering at the time when

286
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:46,839
this happened you know is I one of these

287
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:48,489
terrorists you know is that why I lost

288
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,199
my passport is that what was going on

289
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:53,079
but it's actually much more interesting

290
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:55,449
story so there I was with no passport

291
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:58,809
I'm getting married in Austria need a

292
00:13:55,449 --> 00:14:00,939
passport to get residency and you know

293
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:02,230
social insurance and and all this stuff

294
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:05,079
and like what the am I going to do

295
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:08,319
I couldn't you know I'd always fantasize

296
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,758
with Mike about about revoking my my my

297
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,410
citizenship because I just couldn't

298
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,040
agree with what America had become or

299
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,170
what it was or anything and one minute

300
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,610
already well if that was quick

301
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,639
okay so cool so I'll go through the

302
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,549
stuff so stateless from the piano

303
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:27,100
opticon is pretty much as built on on

304
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:30,549
vinny Gupta's you know declining returns

305
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,019
on the price of ignition s-- I think

306
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:35,739
that's quick enough for you to read and

307
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:37,329
so there I was dead in the water the

308
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:39,549
real reason that it is that I lost my

309
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:41,079
passport is because the reason I can't

310
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,970
be you know up 26 years ago is because I

311
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:47,859
got arrested for selling LSD in at a

312
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:50,110
Grateful Dead concert in Indiana I was

313
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,459
looking at 26 years of prison I had six

314
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,799
month old daughter and I was like

315
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:56,049
that I got on a plane on the day I was

316
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,639
supposed to go to court and flew and

317
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:59,170
flew to flew to Europe and I've been

318
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:04,119
here ever since so like living under the

319
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:05,979
radar and so basically you know it came

320
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:07,480
back to haunt me so could I have a

321
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,059
passport from the state of sabotage

322
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,889
artistic identity no could I use my

323
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:15,129
verifiable identity that you guys all

324
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:19,049
would know to have residency no can I

325
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:22,059
use my transactional identity no no no

326
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:24,429
what can I actually do well the only

327
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:27,100
thing that I could do was to get a Fiat

328
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:29,619
identity so I was lucky enough to land

329
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,540
in a set of grey zones in law where I

330
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:35,410
could get residency in Austria and

331
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:38,589
remain there but here it is Here I am

332
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:42,339
like I spent 26 years basically living

333
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:45,819
out a system and because of because of

334
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:48,549
this I ended up with a my residency card

335
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,929
my social security card now I need a

336
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:54,730
driver's license to be able to register

337
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:56,079
a you know prepaid telephone you can't

338
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,970
even get internet anymore if you don't

339
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,488
have a photo ID

340
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:04,179
and of course I actually now have a bank

341
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:07,299
account since two months without having

342
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:08,079
one and so here's what actually happened

343
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,799
hmm

344
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,909
so I wondered after all of this you know

345
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,949
being in all these places where

346
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:16,989
everybody's looking at my asshole being

347
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:19,569
on every sort of like list you know

348
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:21,159
being my social network mapped with all

349
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:25,539
of these dissidents you know so I

350
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:28,479
applied for my FBI file and I find out

351
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:30,039
that the reason why it is that I came up

352
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:31,809
on the radar where they started looking

353
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:34,059
into me is because when I was working

354
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:36,159
for the Bitcoin foundation they were a

355
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,499
Delaware corporation and they needed a

356
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,669
w-9 form to pay us even though we were

357
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,859
getting paid in Bitcoin they had

358
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:43,478
declared for taxes so I've just like

359
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:44,889
okay whatever I'm never going back to

360
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:49,359
America it you know here's my

361
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:50,829
social security number and I applied so

362
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:52,419
I showed up on the radar I find out for

363
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:54,519
my FB I filed because they were looking

364
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:57,098
at after Gavin went to talk to the CIA

365
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,019
and John mattone s is going to Swift and

366
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:02,229
Charlie Shrem is getting arrested for

367
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:04,269
Silk Road and Mount gox's you know all

368
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,529
that was going on basically big

369
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:10,990
 target on my head

370
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:13,359
so now in a year I can finally apply for

371
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:17,589
Austrian citizenship but to apply for

372
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:19,928
Austrian citizenship I need to be tax

373
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:24,099
compliant and I never file taxes in my

374
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:25,569
life so even though I don't actually

375
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh anything I still have to pay my

376
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,990
social contributions on all that Bitcoin

377
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,759
that I earned from the Bitcoin

378
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:37,059
foundation so one's a punk always a punk

379
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:39,669
 this right the only thing

380
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,860
that's open to me is basically to be

381
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:47,200
like water and and to go with the flow

382
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:49,539
as a surfer so I want to I want to makes

383
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,700
a final statement about my own personal

384
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:55,480
story I think the thing that that annoys

385
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:58,629
me the most about the crypto community

386
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,919
is this sort of like colonial attitude

387
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:01,629
that we have that we're gonna save the

388
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,610
global south we're gonna bank the

389
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:06,580
unbanked when I say we should be

390
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,168
unbanked the banked we can't even get

391
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,169
our own house in order I'd like to see

392
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:13,120
solutions that are built for

393
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,950
let's get our own house in order here in

394
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,189
the West and make solutions that work

395
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,690
for us and that can be potentially

396
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,630
models for other people to make local

397
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:25,560
solutions one thing that I think that so

398
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,770
what we've really succeeded at is is

399
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,770
money

400
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,290
we have almost 10 years now or

401
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:33,810
10 years now of of non state money which

402
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:38,080
i think is a huge accomplishment

403
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:40,149
we have we have bootstrapped aetherium

404
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,040
and if you're miss bootstrap all kinds

405
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,350
of stuff it's incredibly exciting to see

406
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,030
that we actually have a community and an

407
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,490
economy that we can all participate in

408
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,889
in our own webs of trust what it is that

409
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,800
we don't have is we don't have global

410
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,480
identity nobody in or outside of krypton

411
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,149
nobody in or outside of states have

412
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,670
solved the issue of identity and so my

413
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,850
final statement is basically not your

414
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,860
keys not your identity if you can't

415
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,149
revoke this is good this goes back to

416
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,159
the right to be forgotten that we have

417
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,820
here in Europe if you can't revoke your

418
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,890
identity

419
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,560
you can't revoke that private key about

420
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,810
who it is that you are whatever portion

421
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,010
of it it's not your identity those are

422
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:22,080
the things that I'd like to see solved

423
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,080
based on my own personal experience I

424
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,530
[Applause]

425
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,100
didn't feel like I was going so slow at

426
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,420
the beginning there yes thank you I was

427
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,669
thinking that maybe we could try some

428
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,980
question but no I think because time is

429
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:38,050
run time is out and we have a second

430
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,360
speaker thank you go or sharing it was

431
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:43,990
your story if somebody is interested to

432
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,300
find out more definitely catch exile

433
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:49,180
sort of a lighter for a short discussion

434

be definitely very interesting because

452
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,758

clicker thing to doesn't work okay

465
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,510
so hello my name is Charles Hill thank

466
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,909
you for the introduction one of the

467
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,710
applications that I'm working on has

468
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,320
related to double spending that will

469
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,120
come later but first I'd like to ask a

470
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,419
question of the room how many of you

471
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,550
let's say have used Bitcoin transactions

472
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,690
in day-to-day at some point you know

473
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,780
either to buy something or sell

474
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,550
something receive okay all right and

475
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,010
when you're receiving a payment in

476
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,290
Bitcoin what do you usually use your

477
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:10,290
phone how many of you use a phone mobile

478
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:12,180
application to accept payments okay and

479
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:16,139
when you're doing that do you wait for

480
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:19,080
confirmations six confirmations

481
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:26,640
what are you doing selling cars okay all

482
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:30,990
right so okay spoilers okay all right so

483
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,370
hmm super okay so first thing in order

484
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,450
to understand double spending is you

485
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,530
need to understand a little bit about

486
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:39,330
transactions in Bitcoin number one every

487
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,940
transaction is made up of inputs and

488
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:44,040
outputs with the exception of coinbase

489
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,290
transactions which only have an output

490
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,940
or outputs depending on what the miner

491
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:54,030
decides to do with that so basically you

492
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:58,280
have atomic units in a way of unspent

493
00:22:54,030 --> 00:23:01,590
transaction outputs you TXO which you

494
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:05,340
can spend in various ways you can

495
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:09,750
combine outputs to make a single input

496
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:12,120
to a new transaction you can make let's

497
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,860
say you can split one output into

498
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,780
multiple different transactions and so

499
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:23,280
on so just a little bit this is simple

500
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:25,710
enough I hope so next one okay so at the

501
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,720
basic level a double spend is where you

502
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,270
try to spend one of these atomic units

503
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,730
and unspent transaction output for two

504
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:35,940
separate transactions what I mean by

505
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,410
that is the exact same output not

506
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,820
different outputs into the same

507
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,820
transaction but the exact

508
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:45,178
same output you can only ever spend one

509
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,950
output once that's what makes Bitcoin

510
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,899
function but you have to wait for

511
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,840
confirmations in order to know that you

512
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:55,408
really got paid in this case I'm using

513
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,629
the example a lot here to show we've got

514
00:23:55,409 --> 00:24:02,279
Alice in the blue if you can read it and

515
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:05,429
then we've got Bob in red so the inputs

516
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:08,190
left outputs right here we've got one

517
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:10,700
transaction at the top a which is valid

518
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:13,529
if it's confirmed and then B would be

519
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,399
invalid always there can be some

520
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:19,740
exceptions to this for example if a node

521
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:23,580
is looking at the memory pool then you

522
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:25,049
will have it will depend on how that

523
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,870
node is configured whether or not they

524
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:30,720
will accept the second transaction or

525
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,939
the first one or it can also depend and

526
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,289
when they see the transaction they could

527
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,169
be on the other side of the planet and

528
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:39,120
they might not see the second

529
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:42,509
transaction before the first or vice

530
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:47,729
versa so yeah it's up in the air before

531
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:50,159
things get confirmed okay so the first

532
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,440
attack which is basically what I just

533
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,710
described is a race attack so let's say

534
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,340
we want to double spend against Bob and

535
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:03,149
what we would do is we would try to time

536
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,529
things so that Bob will see the

537
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:09,739
transaction that you're trying to pay

538
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:13,110
him but the miners ideally can see the

539
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:16,529
transaction B that would pay Alice

540
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:19,168
so when Bob sees the first transaction

541
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:21,019
their node will reject Alice's

542
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:23,909
transaction so they will never see

543
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:26,340
Alice's transaction the double spend but

544
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:28,769
maybe the miners will see Alice's and

545
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,070
then later reject Bob's this is why this

546
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:36,000
can work it's basically a timing attack

547
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:37,559
okay all right so the next attack is a

548
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,389
little bit more weird and this was

549
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,399
described originally by Hal Finney I

550
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:43,740
don't know how many of you might know

551
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,928
Hal Finney but from the history it was

552
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,820
the first person to receive Bitcoin

553
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:52,410
transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto so

554
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:58,379
basically what you do is you

555
00:25:52,410 --> 00:26:02,070
we'll send a transaction to Bob so Bob

556
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,930
thinks that they were paid but then but

557
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,179
this is a long time ago you will mind

558
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,890
privately a block now you would need to

559
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,330
have access to a lot of hashing power in

560
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,570
order to this for this to work in

561
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:15,360
Bitcoin but back then it was a little

562
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:18,689
bit more feasible to be able to do this

563
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,870
sort of thing so Ellis will mine their

564
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,780
own private block that doesn't include a

565
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:28,110
Bob's transaction but it will include B

566
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:30,210
so that when the Alice is successfully

567
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:34,260
mining her block she can broadcast that

568
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:35,880
block and it will be added to the tip of

569
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,220
the chain and then later will be

570
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:42,060
extended upon by the rest of the miners

571
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,920
and then Bob is out of luck because once

572
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,080
it's confirmed that block that private

573
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,090
block is the first confirmation and the

574
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,770
miners will always mind from the latest

575
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,330
the the highest difficulty chain so

576
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:56,370
mm-hm

577
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:58,649
alright so the next one is a little bit

578
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:01,070
let's say more expensive and this one

579
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,810
can still theoretically happen today

580
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:06,419
it's a the alternate history attack

581
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:10,260
basically rewriting history so you've

582
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:12,330
got a transaction that is mined for Bob

583
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:15,480
so it's similar to the fini attack

584
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:19,020
except this one you allow to be mined

585
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,810
the a transaction for Bob Bob things oh

586
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:25,230
wow super one transaction I can accept

587
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:27,000
this larger payment of goods here you go

588
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,470
you can leave everything's fine

589
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,100
this could even work against online

590
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:34,320
exchanges or other online services which

591
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:39,030
almost always require confirmations

592
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,740
before exchanging goods but this today

593
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,450
would be very very expensive because

594
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,800
again you would need to run a mining

595
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,930
pool and you would need to have

596
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:51,240
significant hash power this is also the

597
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:52,980
51% attack if you have 51% you do this

598
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,630
attack the alternative history attack

599
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:59,810
rewrite history and you're able to

600
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:02,010
double spend because you can remove the

601
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,629
transaction that you don't want to go

602
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,359
through and you have yours that sends

603
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:09,499
the funds back to you

604
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:11,960
this did happen recently was it one year

605
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:13,759
ago perhaps with Bitcoin gold there was

606
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,469
an attack against in exchange there's

607
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:19,339
something like 100 million dollars worth

608
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:26,659
of crypto okay but it happens this this

609
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:28,190
exact attack okay mm-hmm okay so now

610
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:29,719
this one is a little bit more practical

611
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,700
you don't need to run a mining pool in

612
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:34,849
order to do this everybody can do this

613
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,979
this is a replace by fee is a feature in

614
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:39,139
Bitcoin that allows you to bump fees in

615
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:42,259
case that you send out a fee that's too

616
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:44,478
low and it takes too long to confirm you

617
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:47,269
can send out a replacement transaction

618
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:48,830
that basically versions your transaction

619
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:51,499
so that you can bump the fee and then

620
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:53,478
have it confirmed eventually but you can

621
00:28:51,499 --> 00:28:55,879
abuse this feature in order to double

622
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:57,139
spend effectively the problem is that

623
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:58,968
the network can't know that you're

624
00:28:57,139 --> 00:29:01,639
trying to be malicious that it just

625
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:03,559
looks like okay maybe these outputs are

626
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,478
different but we don't know who owns

627
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,529
these outputs so we have to let it all

628
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:10,519
through because they're all valid

629
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:14,960
transactions so there's no real way to

630
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:16,729
defend against this unless you just

631
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,570
don't accept the RBF transactions but

632
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:22,669
then you're going to hurt the UX the

633
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:28,249
user is going to be upset with you okay

634
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:30,950
so one more yeah so now who has some

635
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:33,710
Bitcoin or would like to have some

636
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:35,179
Bitcoin anyone I can try to double spend

637
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,919
maybe I don't have enough time for this

638
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:38,769
I'll do it later if you want come up to

639
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:42,080
me and I will double spend you using

640
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:44,119
this app the next one it's called pain

641
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,009
away it is now available in the Play

642
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:48,738
Store so if you have Android phone you

643
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:55,279
can try it out right now actually let's

644
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:57,139
see there we go so here we go I did a

645
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,269
little bit of testing using this app to

646
00:29:57,139 --> 00:30:01,459
see what was going on

647
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:03,889
what kind of mitigations are possible

648
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,769
what what is it what does it look like

649
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:09,559
when you actually attack the various in

650
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:11,089
this case wallet applications I didn't

651
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,499
have time to do Bitcoin core but I

652
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:15,918
assume it's very similar to the other

653
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:18,590
ones alright so number one block stream

654
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,960
green wallet yeah what this

655
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,789
means I had a few criteria one do they

656
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,320
show the RBF flag because that's a

657
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:26,419
feature that you should know if a

658
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,450
transaction is actually able to be

659
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:30,860
replaced almost none of them actually

660
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,900
warn you about this electron when

661
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:37,129
mycelium were the only two that warned

662
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:40,250
you then a double spent alert basically

663
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:43,940
nothing I call the lecture maybe sort of

664
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,980
because they make it local you can

665
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,510
delete it later so you can correct your

666
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,029
balance because you'll never get those

667
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,370
funds because they were double spent but

668
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:54,470
basically nothing shows you double spend

669
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,860
alerts in terms of wallet applications

670
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:01,010
or even desktop applications it's really

671
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,629
not ideal so and then another I came up

672
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,640
with some other things like for example

673
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,960
intervention I was thinking that you

674
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,940
could do child pays for parents so that

675
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,720
you could get into a race for with your

676
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:13,190
double spender but then really you're

677
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,010
they could just double spend though they

678
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,080
can send the whole output unspent

679
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,490
transaction output as a fee and that's

680
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,908
basically rendering the whole thing

681
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:24,710
pointless so you can't win you you can't

682
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:26,510
hope unless they get distracted and they

683
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,059
run away they think that they won you

684
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,799
can just go try to increase the fee from

685
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:33,230
that transaction that you received you

686
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,029
can pay from that output and then hope

687
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,730
that the network will accept it they

688
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:39,110
might not actually accept that because

689
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:42,049
they'll reject it as a double spend

690
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:43,580
ironically so and then the other one

691
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:45,770
would be correct balance almost all of

692
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:49,399
them were okay you can for example

693
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:53,510
mycelium I believe is okay because they

694
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:55,370
I think they keep the the transaction

695
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:58,490
around but then they only count

696
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:01,100
confirmed outputs as your balance and

697
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,960
it's similar for the other ones but

698
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,189
generally they don't really do a good

699
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,529
job

700
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:08,779
also black explorers because what's

701
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:11,149
another way that users can check to see

702
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:15,500
that they actually got paid and I had

703
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:16,699
kind of different criteria for them the

704
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,890
first two are the same and then the

705
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,929
other two criteria were are both

706
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,909
transactions visible meaning the the

707
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,230
original payment transaction and the

708
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:27,740
double spent transaction are they both

709
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:29,299
visible and that is the most important

710
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,130
for me as an end user to be able to

711
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:33,170
track what's going on

712
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:36,440
and bit apps here at the top seem to be

713
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:38,360
the best blockchain info kind of okay

714
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:42,470
but again they don't even warn you about

715
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:44,750
RBF and then the rest forget about it a

716
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:49,970
lot of these don't even support seg wit

717
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:53,900
still so yeah I don't think that's going

718
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:57,320
to improve okay so root of the problem

719
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,580
is that users want fast transactions

720
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,770
that's why everyone's using zero

721
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,980
confirmation in in-person businesses

722
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:06,770
really require fast transactions and

723
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:09,320
users are using it so we need to make it

724
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:11,690
safer for them to do that and we should

725
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,689
discourage them at all possible - from

726
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,070
using zero confirmation so and also the

727
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,410
fact that as I talked about earlier

728
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:20,540
nodes will not relay all of the

729
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,580
transactions they might only relay some

730
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,350
of these are these versions of

731
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:28,010
transactions if you're trying to do RBF

732
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:29,629
so it won't you won't get a full picture

733
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,730
of what's happening you could be

734
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,110
attacked but you won't realize because

735
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:37,250
your wallet won't see all of the

736
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:38,750
transactions okay all right

737
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,060
the solution there we go somebody

738
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,070
spoiled it at the beginning use lightly

739
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,720
network if you can't stop the people

740
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,580
from doing something that's bad for them

741
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,040
you should make it safer for them to do

742
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,320
that thing so just tell them to use

743
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,379
lightning Network here the apps that I

744
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,899
think are being developed by the main

745
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:59,570
client development teams zap wallet

746
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:03,320
lightning app and Eclair there are I

747
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:04,970
think QR codes yeah okay QR codes there

748
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,730
you go all right I hope the stream can

749
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:09,679
see that download these scan the QR

750
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:12,649
codes use them don't accept zero

751
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,780
confirmation all right and if you want

752
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:17,540
the app to double spend yourself to test

753
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,700
what's going on here you go I say don't

754
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:22,520
trust verify your payment systems so

755
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:24,080
that you can actually know what it looks

756
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,330
like if somebody tries this against you

757
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,620
yeah all right and then the last light

758
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,299
should be there you go if you want to

759
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,339
link to this presentation to find those

760
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,090
QR codes later there you go

761
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,090
and thank you

762
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:43,418
but Thank You Charles

763
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,429
no questions no time no time so

764
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:47,710
questions again if anybody has questions

765
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:50,700
for Charles definitely find him around

766
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:53,740
he will be I think here all the time and

767
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:57,520
I checked the schedule so tomorrow from

768
00:34:53,739 --> 00:35:02,200
4:00 if you like to follow this double

769
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:06,160
spending thingy so right now it's my

770
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:09,970
pleasure to introduce next speaker which

771
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,250
is Mario Hubble he's also part of Parana

772
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:15,549
Polish community and he's kind of a

773
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:18,730
bridge between Bratislava and praha

774
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:21,460
because he he is very active in both of

775
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:24,700
this parody policies first but it's also

776
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:26,670
improv he studies informatics and he is

777
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,589
interested in information security

778
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:34,240
digital privacy and of course bitcoin

779
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:38,500
and right now his presentation will be

780
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:43,330
on how Linux is not now it's back in

781
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:50,740
Ubuntu 19.4 yeah but it's going to be

782
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:55,870
fixed in the October update so but his

783
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:57,910
talk will be about Irish what okay thank

784
00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:00,690
you very much Michael so today I'm going

785
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:03,220
to tell you something about Aaron Swartz

786
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:06,070
Ross Ulbricht was mentioned here today

787
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,839
and personally I really love story of

788
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,540
Ross Ulbricht and you probably heard of

789
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,490
him who knows her so Britt okay and who

790
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,290
heard about Aaron's farts before the

791
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,770
Congress all bunch of people that's

792
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:18,640
awesome

793
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:20,380
great because well I really love story

794
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,180
of her sue breached but I have to say

795
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,810
that when I heard about Aaron

796
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:31,419
I thought it his story is even stronger

797
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:33,220
and so I'm today here to tell you

798
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:38,080
something about him about his life and

799
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:41,680
his legacy so let's start with with this

800
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,930
Aaron Swartz was a genius and I mean

801
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,120
real genius not some clever boy who you

802
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,098
like and you call him genius he was real

803
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,299
genius he

804
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:50,680
 genus that that's a good point

805
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:53,950
yeah he was genius

806
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,419
he was he started to read and write and

807
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,368
and and count and so on when he was

808
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,829
three years old then he got his first

809
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:01,150
computer and you know that moment you

810
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:03,700
remember that when we got here first

811
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:06,520
future and then he started programming

812
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,750
when he was seven with his with his

813
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:14,589
brother they programmed a game which was

814
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:18,390
Star Wars trivia ass and text game from

815
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:20,950
Star Wars world and he he alert

816
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:24,730
programming from this very young age and

817
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:27,069
when he was 12 he got into more you know

818
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:29,440
internet communities and for programming

819
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:34,960
communities and he developed when he was

820
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:38,859
13 in 1999 he made this website called

821
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,700
the info org which was like open library

822
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:46,029
when anybody can contribute so sounds

823
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:48,339
like sounds like Wikipedia but it was

824
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:52,839
like four years before Wikipedia it was

825
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:55,089
done by 12 years old boy and this is

826
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:58,000
like first point that I want to you to

827
00:37:55,089 --> 00:38:03,160
say that this is this was his idea in

828
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:07,869
the early saying H about the open

829
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:10,629
information and then as a 13 years old

830
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:15,670
he get into mailing autumn a linked list

831
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:17,859
and into development of RSS 1.0 which

832
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:21,700
you probably know what it is you can see

833
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:23,490
it spread everywhere I mean irises he

834
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,470
helped to develop some functions and

835
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:29,109
then he was on this mailing list he was

836
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:32,680
often contributing to the code and once

837
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:35,980
they asked him why does he not come to

838
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:38,440
any of these real life meetings and he

839
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:41,500
said that you know I just turned 14 and

840
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,480
my mom probably wouldn't let me and they

841
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,700
were amazed I mean such a young boy who

842
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,609
knows to do stuff like this so they

843
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,770
wanted to meet him and I did they

844
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:53,828
started to do some conferences and so on

845
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,869
and he met a bunch of people he became a

846
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:58,210
friend of Tim berners-lee the inventor

847
00:38:55,869 --> 00:39:01,330
of world wide web

848
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:04,359
and I've heard that it's really popular

849
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:07,750
nowadays to have some sixteen year old

850
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:10,390
kids to talk about to talk on some

851
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,880
international conferences so here is my

852
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:21,069
favorite keep talking on international

853
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:23,349
conference and well Aaron he met he met

854
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,359
Lawrence was sick maybe you know heard

855
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:27,730
about him Lawrence Asik is a lawyer I

856
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:32,859
think from Oxford focused on copyright

857
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:38,380
law and Aaron flew to Washington to see

858
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:40,810
his speech where he introduced idea of

859
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:44,650
Creative Commons you maybe heard of

860
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:47,740
Creative Commons it's organization that

861
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:50,320
promotes how do I say it you know

862
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:53,890
copyright is like all rights reserved

863
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,890
but Creative Commons it's it's a way how

864
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:58,500
to publish your art or whatever under

865
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:04,650
some right

866
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:07,660
reserved so Aaron became friend in his

867
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:10,980
15 years old with Lawrence Lessig this

868
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:13,359
is a lunch party of Creative Commons and

869
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,220
actually we used Creative Commons in

870
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,410
Bratislava you can find maybe polish

871
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:20,950
around here he programmed it and it's a

872
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:23,440
you can write Papa loose dot para on a

873
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:29,319
police car and it is website when you

874
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:31,839
can you can find what music is the best

875
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,570
for its it's a poor of Creative Commons

876
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:38,410
music and you can help us to pick which

877
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:40,480
one is best for playing in cafe in orbit

878
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,730
Grand Cafe in Bratislava so we are

879
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,520
actually using this technology and Aaron

880
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:48,910
was helping to develop it on a technical

881
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,500
level he made it this website and

882
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:55,509
functions when you can filter it and so

883
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:58,000
on and then he went to high school and

884
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:00,430
he hated it of course who likes the high

885
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
school and then school at all and he

886
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:06,730
said why should I listen to the teachers

887
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,099
when I can find all the information on

888
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,650
the internet when I can read the book

889
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:15,250
and learn geometry why would I

890
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:17,380
sent to some teacher and so on so yeah

891
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,940
he left open information and he didn't

892
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:22,180
like to listen to authorities

893
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:26,230
sounds like cool guy and then he went to

894
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:28,060
university and he was on a Stanford and

895
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,870
he was like one of the day stop students

896
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:34,750
you know 1% and after just a year of

897
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:37,060
this university he was offered a place

898
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:42,520
in a startup called

899
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:44,680
I Combinator he accepted and he started

900
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,280
to work on a web website called infogami

901
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,600
which was like service where you can

902
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,770
where you can build your own web page

903
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:58,360
yeah yeah I'm going to build it publicly

904
00:41:53,770 --> 00:42:00,310
Aaron this is him but this site wasn't

905
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:03,910
really successful it struggled to find

906
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:05,950
the users so eventually infogami was

907
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:07,629
merged our development of info gaming

908
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,509
was merit of another with another

909
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:12,790
project of the IQ mentor style startup

910
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:19,240
which was called or which is called

911
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:21,580
reddit so Aaron Swartz became one of the

912
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,359
founders of Reddit one of the three

913
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:30,460

00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:43,480
and you can see his cake day is July 6

918
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:48,540
2005 so like week after ready to us was

919
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:52,810
released yeah and yeah here is

920
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:57,840
explaining how reddit became so

921
00:42:52,810 --> 00:43:03,250
successful and how their users grows so

922
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:07,270
in as the 19 years old he became pretty

923
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:09,070
rich the religion was was merged with

924
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:12,009
some company it was salt or surfing and

925
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:15,430
and Aaron made more than 1 million

926
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:18,540
dollars so imagine it you are 19 years

927
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:20,740

929
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,450
whatever you gonna do in a narrows case

930
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:28,320
he didn't do any party or

931
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:31,180
think he didn't really spend that money

932
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:36,730
he bought some small apartment in San

933

yeah here and I just wanted to to listen

943
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:07,270
to his words and this is something that

944
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,619
I mentioned about the high school and

945
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,320
this is something about the authorities

946
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:16,240
and when it sound and I don't have sound

947
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:18,790
they're probably okay

948
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:23,348
so what I earned it that he didn't part

949
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:27,130
it he became activists he became

950
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:31,050
activists because he wanted to mm didn't

951
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:31,050
want to make okay

952
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:18,180
okay okay

953
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,910
he describes something that I went

954
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,379
through and maybe a bunch of you or many

955
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:26,098
of you because because you are sitting

956
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:28,289
here so well Aaron became activists and

957
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:30,480
there is a lot of activist thing that he

958
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:32,760
had he did but I won't get into that

959
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,470
because we don't have so much time but I

960
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,579
want to tell you for example about pacer

961
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:41,069
pacer is a website where you can access

962
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:44,190
court culture records from the US and

963
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:46,020
the website is arable it's like it was

964
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:49,380
so like it's 40 years old website or

965
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:52,829
something and and you have to pay 8

966
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:57,020
cents per page to to get the public

967
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:59,160
records so he didn't like it and he met

968
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:02,009
founder of some nonprofit that was

969
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:05,220
focused on giving public access to this

970
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:07,680
records and ok let's hack it so he get

971
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,980
in cooperation with his friend from some

972
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:13,319
library where and he had access to this

973
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,329
basically free access so Aaron wrote a

974
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:18,180
script and he Devon along with hundreds

975
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:19,950
of thousands of these records and gave

976
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,589
it to this nonprofit which published it

977
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:25,740
and later when another records were

978
00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:27,960
published he found out that FBI started

979
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,750
investigation of Aaron because of this

980
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:34,049
but they trade down because it wasn't

981
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,070
like something so illegal but we are

982
00:46:34,049 --> 00:46:38,169
getting there

983
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,169

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,759
ok thanks and yeah ok another thing is

985
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,529
SOPA it is Stop Online Piracy Act you

986
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,049
probably heard of it it's this stupid

987
00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:53,010
copyright egg that will put you in the

988
00:46:49,049 --> 00:46:55,529
prison for downloading a movie and Aaron

989
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:59,279
became a strong voice against this act

990
00:46:55,529 --> 00:47:02,029
and eventually he helped to stop it in a

991
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:04,410
Congress and this is like this was

992
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:06,510
important thing because he became a pain

993
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:11,210
in the ass of the some people in

994
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:13,920
Congress but it all came together

995
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:16,260
yeah open access manifesto

996
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,750
this is manifesto he wrote and

997
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:23,040
yeah I got it here this is just whew

998
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:24,960
this is just a few lines of it and he's

999
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,360
writing there that people have to have

1000
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,900
access to the information but most

1001
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:34,620
importantly to research because many of

1002
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:36,840
the publicly funded taxpayers funded by

1003
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,680
experts money many of this research is

1004
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,820
behind paywalls

1005
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:44,430
and you have to pay since I'm at now

1006
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:48,240
enormous amounts publishers like Reed

1007
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:50,790
Elsevier for example and so his idea was

1008
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,009
that people should have free access to

1009
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:55,140
the publicly funded research and this is

1010
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:56,820
this is a discrimination against many

1011
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,440
people for example people from third

1012
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:03,210
world countries or just poor countries

1013
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:05,880
that cannot cannot then just don't have

1014
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:10,410
money to pay enormous amounts to the

1015
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:12,690
publishers so the question is how many

1016
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:17,399
lines of code can kill you

1017
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:19,260
you know cipher Bank motor of self bank

1018
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,180
is we've read the code the question is

1019
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,030
how many lines of code can kill you and

1020
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:27,379
in the Aeros case it was less than

1021
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:32,040
twenty lines and it was in Python yeah

1022
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:33,630
okay I'll get I'll explain it so as I

1023
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,990
mentioned you have to pay to this

1024
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:39,150
publishers to get research articles so

1025
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:40,680
if you if you are a few we're student

1026
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,750
who maybe noticed it that your

1027
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:46,230
university has access to something like

1028
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:50,270
JSTOR or ScienceDirect which is which is

1029
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:56,070
a subscription-based database of this of

1030
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:58,890
this researchers and so on and he wanted

1031
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:01,280
to make them more open or I don't want

1032
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:04,890
to speak about his motivations but

1033
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:09,030
according to this thing's as I mentioned

1034
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:10,500
I mentioned before that I guess you

1035
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,750
probably understand why he did that

1036
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,420
and what he did was that he wrote a

1037
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:20,490
script that is called keep grabbing that

1038
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:21,750
PI and on he you can find it on github

1039
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:26,100
by the way I downloaded

1040
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:28,230
it's my sublime and yeah the thing is

1041
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,259
that in the JSTOR in this database all

1042
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:33,630
the research papers where

1043
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:38,160
numbered just numbered so all we had to

1044
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:41,460
do is just iterate it and push there

1045
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:45,029
push there you know ask for a

1046
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:46,560
downloading a PDF so he download it like

1047
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:50,610
this well after a few days of

1048
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:55,380
downloading JSTOR of course Bennett his

1049
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:58,440
IP and then did it again and then Aaron

1050
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:01,500
got met and he went to some seller

1051
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:04,080
something in on MIT and he plugged his

1052
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:07,130
computer right to the right to the

1053
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:10,170
server so he couldn't get bent and

1054
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:13,320
overall he downloaded more than 700

1055
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:15,390
gigabytes of their papers and of course

1056
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:19,380
people on MIT found this I mean it's not

1057
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:22,980
well hidden yeah it's behind his doors

1058
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:26,220
and what I did is they didn't say hey

1059
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:28,860
mate what is this it's not cool they put

1060
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:31,049
camera there and you can see maybe I

1061
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,760
won't won't play it but they put their

1062
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:35,820
camera and they were waiting for him to

1063
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:39,500
come for his computer so they found him

1064
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:42,000
and when he went home he switched

1065
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:45,480
external drive there and then he went

1066
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,150
home on a bike and on a way home he was

1067
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,240
arrested by police and the funny thing

1068
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:54,000
Secret Service agent because Secret

1069
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:57,830
Service was already investigated him and

1070
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,660
you can find or many videos like this

1071
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:03,930
also from the police station and so on

1072
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,850
on this playlist and the first video in

1073
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:08,540
the playlist is my craft tutorial for

1074
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:12,360
some reason but others are our own oh

1075
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:14,759
yeah so this was really bad and so

1076
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:19,350
there's the prosecution against Aaron

1077
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:22,410
started and the first thing they wanted

1078
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:25,259
to put him in jail for 25 years plus

1079
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:27,569
something which is crazy like 40 years

1080
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:29,670
for downloading and articles and if you

1081
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:31,680
agree with some maybe intellectual

1082
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:34,770
property or copyright laws or something

1083
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,960
you we can I think we can agree that on

1084
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:38,730
that that for downloading and articles

1085
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,640
that he didn't publish or anything this

1086
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:43,890
is like really too much maybe it can be

1087
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:47,339
enough for I don't know some some

1088
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:51,200
you know something when he tries to make

1089
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:55,140
an competition to chase or something but

1090
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:59,089
he didn't publish it and they couldn't

1091
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:03,029
prove any motivation and so on but

1092
00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:06,569
yammering of time but the thing is why

1093
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:08,640
they pushed so hard on him and my terror

1094
00:52:06,569 --> 00:52:11,069
is and what I want to say is that they

1095
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,859
wanted to make an example of him example

1096
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:17,250
of Hecker who got get into jail because

1097
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:22,069
of his activism so don't listen to that

1098
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:26,130
and after months and years of pushing

1099
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:29,720
Aaron gave up and Aaron committed

1100
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:34,829
suicide when he was 26 years old and I

1101
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:37,078
like like this this title more he was

1102
00:52:34,829 --> 00:52:40,349
found dead in his apartment he hanged

1103
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:44,760
himself and I won't I don't want to get

1104
00:52:40,349 --> 00:52:46,470
into conspiracies but if you want to

1105
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,329
read some conspiracy just go to reddit

1106
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:51,269
or some for us and so on there's a bunch

1107
00:52:48,329 --> 00:52:53,579
of it but you know just few hours before

1108
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:55,950
he's dead he was calling with Sam on and

1109
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:58,500
so on and he didn't left any any suicide

1110
00:52:55,950 --> 00:53:00,660
notes and so on so he was painting their

1111
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:03,269
ass in the government and my point is

1112
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:07,170
the government killed him maybe in some

1113
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:11,839
conspiracies explicitly but after all

1114
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:15,029
this tyrannical housing of Aaron

1115
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:18,808
government killed him at least

1116
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:22,980
implicitly yeah then after after his

1117
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:24,920
debt MIT MIT site was hacked and this is

1118
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:28,400
really nice literate I like it's called

1119
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:31,109
information to people a statue of Aaron

1120
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,690
some something from his legacy he get

1121
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:35,880
after he's dead he was awarded with

1122
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,740
James Madison award for being outspoken

1123
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,420
advocate for public participation in

1124
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:41,220
government and an electric access to

1125
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,720
peer-reviewed scholarly articles and the

1126
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,700
funny thing is that other Aaron's law

1127
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,160
which is was act it was pushed into

1128
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,990
Congress and now allows you to do

1129
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,118
something that Aaron's did now he

1130
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:55,049
couldn't be even prosecuted for this

1131
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:57,000
they also changed computer and Fraud and

1132
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:57,600
Abuse Act which was like like some

1133
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,700
stupid egg

1134
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,830
from 80s when people imagined hacking

1135
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:04,799
like I don't know what so this is like

1136
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:08,580
over helming least wrong article it was

1137
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:11,120
used against Aaron and this they started

1138
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:15,420
investigations in Congress of some

1139
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:18,960
congressman's and also this for example

1140
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:21,680
this this campaign PDF tribute started

1141
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,780
when people publish their articles

1142
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:28,430
freely and so people can can so it and

1143
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:32,100
this was done by many really known

1144
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:36,299

00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:08,370
in Peroni police to remember Aaron is

1157
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:11,040
that we made silver coins with Aaron's

1158
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:15,060

00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:24,150
Aaron Swartz which is what you can buy

00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:29,640
it's attached to the Bitcoin private key

1164
