2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,149
[Music]

3
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,429
so hello everybody welcome it's on slave

4
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,930
Arnaz stage

5
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:37,809
our program is continue and it's already

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:42,519
4:00 p.m. so but still a lot of good

7
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:44,169
talks is ahead of us before I introduce

8
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:46,030
the next speaker I would just like to

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,089
point out one thing because I realized

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,579
it when I was reading the bio I was in

11
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:53,440
the discussion with one developer like a

12
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:55,170
few weeks ago and we discussed how

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,089
important is for the people to

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,910
understand the audience we are

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:04,780
developing for or you are developing for

16
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,369
and we talk this as be very crucial so

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,300
this is all sort of thing why this year

18
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:12,640
we tried to put much more diverse talks

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,800
into the program like people from

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,090
sociology cool background or just

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,340
stellar additions

22
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,160
not many into like so much into crypto

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,350
technology so I would like to we are

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,550
very open for your feedback to let us

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,059
know what do you think about this

26
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:31,720
approach for the next year of hdcp which

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,599
are coming but now it's my pleasure to

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,420
introduce and welcome on stage mark

29
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:40,090
Norell who is a mathematician who turned

30
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,310
programmer he runs a vc-backed open

31
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,039
source company and has traveled to 30

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,660
countries the diverse cultures he has

33
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:49,450
experienced for this passion for

34
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,399
learning sharing and creating open

35
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,649
technology freely for all

36
00:01:51,399 --> 00:02:01,840
so mark thank you for coming and floor

37
00:01:53,649 --> 00:02:04,989
is yours I'm mark Nadal and I'm really

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,020
excited to present the research that my

39
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:11,290
research team has spent the whole last

40
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,950
year on exploring different economic

41
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,190
models

42
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,079
so we're partly moving towards looking

43
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,390
at economics because our current

44
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,450
decentralized network has about 8

45
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,339
million monthly active users on it we're

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,619
gonna be working with some nonprofits

47
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,840
and startups over the next year to two

48
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,970
years that already have a large audience

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,030
of their own that we'll be bringing up

50
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,020
that number to 80 million monthly active

51
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,440
users in the next year to two years

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,920
at that point we realized this is 1% of

53
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,640
the world's population we need to stop

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,780
worrying about us sitting in a basement

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,850
writing code and look more at who are

56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,570
these people what is the psychology

57
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:01,530
behind people what is the economics that

58
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,260
drive things forward so the first thing

59
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:09,750
I want to note that will be the theme

60
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:14,190
for this entire presentation is if money

61
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:19,260
is a tool that enables the lifestyle

62
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:24,420
that we want then economics is the tool

63
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:26,970
to get the society that we want and that

64
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,000
means we need to study economics and

65
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,980
there are a lot of problems to solve in

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,890
economics I'm gonna be presenting the

67
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,530
six foundational flaws or questions or

68
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,480
problems that any economic system must

69
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,530
address so that way we can figure out

70
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,660
how to cultivate a better society based

71
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,970
off these problems that hopefully moves

72
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,810
people's alignments towards each other

73
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,850
forward so without further adue problem

74
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:59,010
number six it might be a little bit

75
00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:05,850
surprising how do you measure digital

76
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:07,890
goods or any post scarce item we live in

77
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,280
an economic model based off of scarcity

78
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:15,089
it's a zero-sum game both capitalism and

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,608
socialism that in Bitcoin is as well if

80
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,220
I give you Bitcoin I lose the Bitcoin

81
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,979
you gain the Bitcoin I lose the Bitcoin

82
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,880
a zero-sum scarce game

83
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,950
so mostly systems cannot account for

84
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:34,290
digital goods but there's a very simple

85
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:40,200
equation for that supply / demand equals

86
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:43,800
a a is the abundance factor of something

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,969
so if we have five Lamborghinis and a

88
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,520
hundred people in a population the five

89
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:54,240
over a hundred wines that being below

90
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,210
it's 5% so that thing is scarce but if

91
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,759
we have something like Disney a movie

92
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,818
every single superhero movie that Disney

93
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,009
has made we could stream every single

94
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,669
one of those movies to the whole world's

95
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:12,270
population probably 10 times over at

96
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:15,539
near zero marginal costs so the

97
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,930
abundance factor and that is is above 1

98
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:22,460
it's probably above 10 it's very very

99
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:25,919
large so a gives us a way to measure

100
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:28,560
what the abundance of something is and

101
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,099
if it's below 1 it lets us know it's a

102
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,159
scarce item I'm not a capitalist I'm not

103
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,930
a socialist but my socialist friends and

104
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:39,419
my capitalist friends have debates and

105
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,250
I've heard my socialist friends make

106
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:45,389
this argument against my capitalist

107
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:48,919
friends which is quote a rich person has

108
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:52,800
an over abundance of money

109
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:56,758
therefore the dollar bills individually

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,380
is less valuable to them as the

111
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,860
socialist is making this claim quote

112
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:05,909
that taking a few million dollars away

113
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:09,750
from a billionaire doesn't matter as

114
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:12,810
much compared to somebody else in quote

115
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,330
they're taking this idea the more of

116
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,240
something that you have somehow reflects

117
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:22,590
the devaluation of the rest of what you

118
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,169
have and this conflation of value and

119
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,479
scarcity is throughout all economics

120
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:30,930
including capitalism another clear

121
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,330
example of this is piracy a digital good

122
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,400
as I was talking about could be

123
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:41,219
distributed way more than imaginable so

124
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:44,039
these corporations these companies have

125
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:46,169
to step in to the government and Lobby

126
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:49,530
the government and add regulation add

127
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:54,090
regulation to our citizens lives to

128
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:56,929
create artificial scarcity for digital

129
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:00,179
goods such that the company is

130
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,610
attempting to measure these post scarce

131
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,050
digital goods in a way that fits with

132
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,430
existing scarcity model

133
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:12,090
so as you understand back 300 years ago

134
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,250
when both capitalism was made and 170

135
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,960
issue years ago when communism was

136
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,700
suggested nobody was thinking about

137
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,299
post-scarcity but there a very important

138
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,140
issue to address in any economic model

139
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,110
so how do we fix this

140
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,760
well do we just print more money every

141
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,430
single time somebody streams a movie

142
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:34,260
it's that way we somehow capture that to

143
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:36,780
represent it in the increase in GDP no

144
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:40,560
because that causes a whole nother set

145
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:43,260
of problems so problem number 5 how do

146
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,430
you control the money supply such that

147
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:52,289
over time it does not cause economic

148
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:54,210
destabilization or a crash inflation if

149
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,890
you keep on printing more money you get

150
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,549
inflation and it destabilizes the

151
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:02,909
economy well is also an interesting

152
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,890
little thing which is ok all economic

153
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,960
models are using kindergarten math and I

154
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,789
think that's fine but in this

155
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,370
kindergarten math we are using what are

156
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,820
called counting numbers so dollar bills

157
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,770
and coins are countable numbers and in

158
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,650
computer science that is called an

159
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:23,880
integer and in mathematics that's

160
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:28,530
represented by the typeface Z it's of

161
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:33,030
key importance to note that any change

162
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:38,000
or I should say the value of a countable

163
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:41,069
dollar is tied to the change in supply

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,169
so simple math example here is if you

165
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,420
have a hundred coins and I hold one of

166
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,550
them then my coin is worth one over a

167
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,420
hundred but if we add a hundred more

168
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,859
coins

169
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:55,260
we now have 200 coins and the value of

170
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,320
that coin previously 1 over 100 is now 1

171
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,390
over 200 which is far less but this is

172
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,640
absolutely ridiculous I am holding the

173
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,980
same physical coin how on earth is it

174
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,300
changing its value over time I mean

175
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,340
we're all used to this because we've

176
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,689
grown up in societies that use this type

177
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,820
of economic model but think of how

178
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,820
ludicrous that is I'm holding something

179
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,160
I'm not it's right there and just over

180
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,769
time it's changing that like this

181
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,329
bizarre

182
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:23,920
that's like not natural so math has this

183
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:26,199
other really cool thing called real

184
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,519
numbers that include ratios and

185
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:31,628
fractions and all the Sutter's stuff

186
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:35,139
including countable numbers so we can

187
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:38,529
adjust economic models to use real

188
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:39,819
numbers and do something interesting so

189
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,850
here's a little story right

190
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:45,878
you got some Bitcoin and you really want

191
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,980
pizza you're not a hot oiler you really

192
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,559
want some pizza so you're waiting in

193
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,049
line to get that pizza but you're you're

194
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,089
thinking oh man what was the price what

195
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:58,389
was like the conversion rate of pizza

196
00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:00,009
today - like sorry Bitcoin - - dollar

197
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,480
amount was it ten thousand was it seven

198
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:03,819
thousand and then you're thinking man

199
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,100
this line is really long and they say

200
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:07,509
that the pizza is worth let's just

201
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,519
pretend us one Bitcoin to make the math

202
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,799
easy in terms of tracking numbers you're

203
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,110
like oh man if this is gonna be a ten

204
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,449
minute line I really hope that Bitcoin

205
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,459
doesn't go up because then when I go

206
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,498
violet in my pizza I'm effectively

207
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:22,599
paying more but I do kind of hope that

208
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:25,869
it goes down because then I can get the

209
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,610
pizza for cheaper this is also true with

210
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:29,679
dollar bills with inflation and stuff

211
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,730
because of the countable number but if

212
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:39,040
you were to represent the price of the

213
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:41,949
pizza as a ratio as a fraction you could

214
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,339
have the entire economy inflate by 80

215
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:48,008
times crash in half and do all sort of

216
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:49,860
loops and circles whatever in the ten

217
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:53,679
minute time and you'd be totally

218
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:57,720
unaffected so key piece right here key

219
00:10:53,679 --> 00:11:03,629
piece is that ratios hold true

220
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:07,869
regardless of supply ratios hold true

221
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:11,049
regardless of supply great now we

222
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:17,019
actually have some mathematical ways of

223
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:18,549
fixing the inflation problem but there's

224
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:19,779
all sorts of other problems and it

225
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:22,419
actually makes some of these problems

226
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:24,699
worse um I do want to note though that

227
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:29,439
you can really only have a ratio based

228
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:30,939
economic model in a Internet era world

229
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,660
so you couldn't you couldn't do this

230
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:33,189
even like 80

231
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,930
years ago but hey we have the internet

232
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:42,070
now so cool let's move forward problem

233
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:46,510
number four how do you prevent the

234
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:50,320
currency from being manipulated or civil

235
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,270
attacked ratio based systems have this

236
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,760
problem even worse than counting based

237
00:11:52,270 --> 00:12:03,520
systems but they all they all have the

238
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:09,550
exact same problems so what math do we

239
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:13,150
need this is called the handshake

240
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:15,550
problem and as a mathematician I look at

241
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,620
this extremely simple looking formula

242
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,620
and I just drool cuz it's beautiful in

243
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,080
buy-in minus one over two so what is the

244
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,940
handshake problem a handshake problem

245
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,130
and you think of it as if you were to

246
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,860
collect a contact card from every single

247
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,840
person at this conference so such that

248
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,150
you hand shook every single person you

249
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,010
got a single contact card from them

250
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:40,319
how many handshakes would happen at the

251
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:44,920
conference ok why does that matter well

252
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,470
this is really neat because the problem

253
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:51,849
is a permutation or a combinatorial

254
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:56,050
problem so the results have explosive

255
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:59,280
differences which means as long as you

256
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:03,459
have a rough estimate of the actual

257
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,870
population size which is in you're able

258
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,870
to use this equation to get a

259
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:12,330
probabilistic guarantee of how many

260
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:14,530
other accounts in the system are fake

261
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,540
this isn't just theory though it's

262
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:20,189
actually working in practice so my

263
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:24,370
colleague Marty Malmi was the very first

264
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:27,070
contributor to Satoshi on Bitcoin like

265
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,950
old school days 2010 2011 he was known

266
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,800
by a serious and he's come up with an

267
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:37,840
algorithm called identify that does

268
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:40,180
something similar he ran this algorithm

269
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,810
against the Bitcoin trading network and

270
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,130
was able to detect the bots in the

271
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,930
trading network and

272
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,200
uses this really cool principle called

273
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,939
the six degrees of separation in

274
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,100
psychology is very well known in

275
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,190
psychology and this was from a long time

276
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,740
ago the six degrees of separation states

277
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:02,980
how many times would we have to

278
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:05,020
physically mail something handshakes

279
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,710
apart before we could connect with

280
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:11,319
everybody in the world only six times on

281
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:15,490
average through physical mail forwarding

282
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:20,320
but on modern social networks Twitter

283
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:25,680
Facebook that degree of separation is

284
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:28,060
down to three and a half handshakes

285
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,280
three and a half degrees of separation

286
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,640
think about that if I buy a handshake

287
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:36,970
across three people depth I can connect

288
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:40,830
with anybody in the world so Marty has

289
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:44,860
gone on to create something called iris

290
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:51,990
which is a better money

291
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:56,950
Liss alternative to Bitcoin a moneyless

292
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:59,680
decentralized alternative it's not just

293
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,270
the very first believer in Satoshi that

294
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,400
is building these types of systems you

295
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:07,230
also have extraordinary centralized

296
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:12,310
competition your credit card company

297
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:15,310
Facebook China they're all taking these

298
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,790
types of algorithms and using it to do

299
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:22,900
fraud detection laundering prediction

300
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:26,890
and automatic auditing so the key

301
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:35,400
takeaway for this point is the future of

302
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:38,680
where money has already gone and is gone

303
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:45,150
this is where the future of money has

304
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,150
already gone and money itself is gone I

305
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:52,150
can't believe I just said that to a

306
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:56,020
crowd full of Bitcoin people there's

307
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:59,090
still a lot of problems which is the

308
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:02,329
climax actually of all of the economic

309
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:06,320
questions it's the one thing that all in

310
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:10,930
any economic system has to answer it has

311
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:14,570
to answer well how do you set prices

312
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:22,819
such that you value hard work and labor

313
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:25,100
I don't know how does socialism and

314
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,540
capitalism do this actually I mean you

315
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,920
probably intuitively already know this

316
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,199
but it's interesting how they answer it

317
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,120
capitalism says that there is this

318
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,110
dollar amount which is the average

319
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,940
across the force of the free market

320
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,580
that's what capitalism is saying hey you

321
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,830
know that's how you set prices to

322
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:47,990
measure labor or hard work

323
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:51,320
socialism says actually we should set

324
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:54,140
prices based off of class so if you're

325
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,410
poor something's cheaper if you're rich

326
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,150
it's more expensive so we talked about

327
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,120
what my socialist friends say to my

328
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,579
capitalist friends and well what do my

329
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,410
capitalist friends tell my socialist

330
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,379
friends again I'm not a socialist I'm

331
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:12,949
not a capitalist my capitalist friends

332
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,319
make the following argument quote if you

333
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:21,650
do not reward people for working harder

334
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:26,270
than others then even healthy capable

335
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:30,200
people will not contribute to the

336
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:37,280
economy and everybody will be worse off

337
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:40,250
in an economic stalemate in quote ladies

338
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,160
and gentlemen is far worse than there's

339
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,890
a whole other set of problems here which

340
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,230
is I'll give you a little story I met up

341
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:51,560
with friend he happened to be of the

342
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,000
same socioeconomic class I don't know if

343
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,000
that's a good or bad thing but we were

344
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,920
in the same class and we went to buy

345
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,540
some coffee and we paid the average

346
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,260
market force of coffee which is about

347
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:06,020
two dollars per cup and we're sitting

348
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,190
there chatting and I'm starting to get

349
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,610
sleepy

350
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,440
I enjoy the coffee but coffee's making

351
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,689
me sleepy and my friend

352
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,310
it's just talking more and more and more

353
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,810
getting excited and that's odd if you

354
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,220
know me I'm usually the one chatting all

355
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,919
the time

356
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,660
and I suddenly wake up and realize like

357
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,940
whoa wait a second

358
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,980
we both enjoy coffee but we get

359
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,020
different value out of this thing it

360
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,300
doesn't matter whether we're richer or

361
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,090
poorer or there's an average market

362
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,940
force Coffee has a negative effect on me

363
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:42,580
and it's having a positive effect on you

364
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:47,180
it is a fuel source for you we get

365
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:51,470
different value out of the same thing

366
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:54,560
and what on earth every single economic

367
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:57,710
model is supposed to figure out what we

368
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,950
value but we don't even bother asking

369
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,620
people what they value we use some sort

370
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,960
of esoteric heuristic of purchasing

371
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:10,719
power or class or something to try and

372
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:14,750
infer or assume or get at that variable

373
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,500
it's absurd think about it

374
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:20,570
so my radical revolutionary proposition

375
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,880
to you is that if we want to get our

376
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:28,820
data science right why don't we just ask

377
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,630
people what they value oh but I can't be

378
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,730
because everybody won't answer

379
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:36,950
differently well that well maybe that's

380
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:38,720
the way economics is so I'll disclose no

381
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,590
offense to coffee connoisseurs in the

382
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:46,010
office in the event coffee is less than

383
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:48,320
1% of my daily value so what about

384
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:51,860
things like housing well housing is

385
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,120
about 35% of my daily value and again

386
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:57,340
this might be different for each of you

387
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:02,629
that's fine groceries or food is about

388
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:08,899
8% of my daily value a car or

389
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:13,940
transportation is about 15% of my daily

390
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:16,030
value it's not that hard it's different

391
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,920
and people are scared of difference but

392
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,840
economics is supposed to answer this one

393
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:24,590
a crucial question and we're just

394
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:38,749
assuming everything else

395
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:42,168
ah there's a lot more problems who do

396
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:46,970
you reward and how do you prevent Free

397
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:49,700
Riders again capitalism and socialism

398
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:55,309
have different answers to this the fury

399
00:20:49,700 --> 00:21:00,220
in capitalism is that as long as I have

400
00:20:55,309 --> 00:21:03,139
a larger amount of dollars then the good

401
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,299
then I can buy that good and the theory

402
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:07,389
continues that then the seller of the

403
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:10,220
good is collecting these dollars and

404
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:17,600
their wealth is increasing which gives

405
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:20,210
them access to luxury goods that works

406
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,009
in a scarcity model the scarcity model

407
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:27,169
is basically stating the more luxurious

408
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:29,749
or scarce an item is the higher the

409
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:33,619
price is but if we want to count for

410
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:37,190
digital goods we actually have to oddly

411
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:43,189
enough in verse this is that scarce

412
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:46,220
goods have a smaller ratio and ahaha

413
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,320
sneaky the a right here is the a from

414
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,549
problem number six the measuring

415
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,850
post-scarcity this is the abundance

416
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:56,389
factor and so it actually turns out that

417
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:59,269
if the abundance factor is larger than

418
00:21:56,389 --> 00:22:03,769
the giving index which I'll get to in

419
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:09,619
just a second the good is given away for

420
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:13,009
free to that person in exchange for a

421
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:16,459
statement of how valuable the

422
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:19,820
interaction with the giver was this is

423
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:22,159
odd as long as the abundance factor or

424
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,730
something is larger and you're giving

425
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,360
index you get things for free as long as

426
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,919
you state the value of the interaction

427
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:34,100
well of course we need to know what the

428
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,409
giving index is but let's imagine that

429
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,850
there is a lamborghini there's five of

430
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:38,390
them and there's a population of a

431
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,000
hundred

432
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,350
so we can calculate the abundance factor

433
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,850
which in this case it's not because it's

434
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:48,110
below one if a Lamborghini is at five

435
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:51,139
percent point zero five in contrast to

436
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:53,300
digital goods like a movie that has

437
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,920
above one you could stream it an

438
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:59,980
infinite number of times or let's take

439
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:02,210
food there might be 50 there might be

440
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,460
200 meals out there but if there's only

441
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,490
a hundred people in this room then the

442
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:10,610
supply of 200 meals with the demand or

443
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,260
population of a hundred 200 over on one

444
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,979
hundred means as an abundance factor of

445
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,360
two so the giving index how do we a

446
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:23,660
reward who do we reward who do we reward

447
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:26,060
okay we give away things for free we got

448
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,580
to calculate this this giving index of

449
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,139
who is the biggest giver in society

450
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,189
that's the type of society that I want

451
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,620
to create I wanna I want to create a

452
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:36,560
society where where the room where

453
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,350
people are incentivized to go out and

454
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,389
donate and give and help people and

455
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,620
that's my personal bias right but then

456
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,620
how do you measure that especially if

457
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,060
you have this ratio system which is too

458
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,000
fuzzy all over the place you really need

459
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:52,870
a countable number system an integer

460
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,610
system in order to determine who's the

461
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:58,459
richest man in the world Jeff Bezos

462
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,169
right with like 150 billion before he

463
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,670
split it in half you need this countable

464
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,290
number but we don't have that in a ratio

465
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,570
system so oh no what do we do what do we

466
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:08,240
do what do we do what do i do wait ah

467
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:11,960
there's there's a nice math trick which

468
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,200
is the population is limited there's a

469
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,650
finite number of people so all we have

470
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,890
to do is take the ratio the percent

471
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:26,300
value and multiply it against the number

472
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:28,040
of people somebody has helped so to keep

473
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,419
the math simple it's a bit crude imagine

474
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,520
that there's a hundred people in a

475
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,170
population and there's only two people

476
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,350
who actually do the work of giving

477
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:39,500
things of producing and distributing

478
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:41,209
goods to people that's Alice and Bob 98

479
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,240
are lazy people that are just Free

480
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:47,360
Riders so Alice builds a hotel that has

481
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:52,010
a hundred rooms in it and every day

482
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:54,350
gives a room to every hundred person

483
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:58,280
and let's just average that each person

484
00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:01,550
winds up saying on average the value of

485
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,530
having housing is 50% of the daily value

486
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,149
of course it's actually different for

487
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:09,080
each person but to make the numbers easy

488
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:11,570
50% now there's Bob who gives food to a

489
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,949
hundred people every single day and

490
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:18,110
people on average rate the food as being

491
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:21,620
10% of their daily value

492
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,909
so to get this number we have to be

493
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,189
careful because what to do two things we

494
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,050
multiply by the number of people that

495
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,810
you've helped with the ratio but we have

496
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,550
to do it multiple handshakes deep so

497
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:34,610
here's how it plays out

498
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,889
Alice helped 100 people they all stated

499
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:40,100
50 percent so 100 times 50 percent is 50

500
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,540
Bob helped a hundred people they stayed

501
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,120
it was ten percent so you get ten

502
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,159
however Alice and Bob also helped each

503
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,280
other

504
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:52,580
Bob would not be able to donate food to

505
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:55,160
people if he had to pay for housing but

506
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:58,850
Alice is giving away housing for free so

507
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:02,180
Bob is stating that he gets 50% of his

508
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:07,850
value from Alice so we go one handshake

509
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:10,610
below and we add this extra compute to

510
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:14,389
Alice's number which is 50 percent of

511
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:16,729
Bob's countable number of 10 is 5 and we

512
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,220
add that to Alice's existing 50 so we

513
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:25,070
get 55 assert total countable number for

514
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:26,630
the layer what two handshakes deep again

515
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,669
I want to be very clear we do not take

516
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:33,770
anything away from Bob we're only adding

517
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:35,270
and vice versa so Bob is giving value to

518
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,530
Alice Alice really wouldn't be able to

519
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,560
do what she's doing unless she was

520
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:42,530
getting food from Bob so Alice has

521
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,379
stated that Bob brings her about 10

522
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:47,899
percent of her daily values we take her

523
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:49,790
first handshake level of the number the

524
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,350
countable multiplication with just 50 it

525
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,960
would take ten percent of that and we

526
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,969
get five and now we add the five we

527
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,650
don't take it away from Alice we add an

528
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,650
additional five to Bob's number which

529
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,330
was originally ten now handshake two we

530
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,900
get 15

531
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,040
now we get to just run a simple sorting

532
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:10,190
equation and programming for familiars

533
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:13,310
we we take the number of 55 for Alice

534
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,020
the number of 50 15 for Bob and then

535
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:17,060
zero zero zero zero zero zero for all

536
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,520
the 98 other people who are just

537
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,190
benefiting from this and you're able to

538
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,129
sort that and get a percentile of who's

539
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,110
the top giver in the economy so top two

540
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:29,360
percent giver you know mid 50 bottom

541
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:33,050
ninety percent so I'm gonna bounce it

542
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,030
back to here which is a / G Alice is in

543
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:37,010
the top one percent right Bob's top two

544
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,660
percent just rough calculations on the

545
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,550
math because we intentionally

546
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,980
constructed a situation that's easy for

547
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:46,520
us to reason about and you note here

548
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:49,480
that the Lamborghinis scarcity index

549
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:53,420
from from the abundance calculation is

550
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:56,240
five percent Alice's in the top one

551
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,910
percent one percent is a smaller number

552
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,420
it's a smaller give that the giving

553
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:05,390
index is smaller than the scarcity index

554
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,630
for the Lamborghinis so Alice actually

555
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:11,510
gets the Lamborghini for free also

556
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:15,200
because this equation holds true now

557
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:16,370
there's five Lamborghinis Bob might get

558
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,700
the other one but what about the

559
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:21,320
remaining three this is where the

560
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,940
capitalism and socialism kind of splits

561
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,909
right down the middle which is maybe

562
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,380
Alice and Bob get to own the Lamborghini

563
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,870
because they have a smaller number but

564
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:33,890
there's three Lamborghinis left over and

565
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:37,250
that can be crowd shared across the rest

566
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:39,440
of the members in a society so we're

567
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:43,940
still utilizing the resources in an

568
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:47,360
economy but when the index doesn't match

569
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:49,450
it has to wind up splitting and that

570
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,770
one's being the crowd sharing economy

571
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,660
another way to think about this so stop

572
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:55,610
thinking about that I switched over to

573
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,370
this idea you're at a bakery and there's

574
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:00,949
ten people in line you would hope just

575
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:03,379
from a social standpoint if Alice walked

576
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,790
in that the ten people in the line who

577
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,370
are getting free housing from Alice

578
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:09,770
would be like thank you Alice so much

579
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,479
please like please move ahead of me in

580
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,150
line you've given me so much value I

581
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,500
want to give you priority access so

582
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,220
regardless of whether the society

583
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,440
actually

584
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,710
does this socially we're actually able

585
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,909
to algorithmically give priority access

586
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:29,380
to the biggest givers the biggest donors

587
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:32,659
in a society to the top-of-the-line that

588
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:37,610
matches their giving index so there is a

589
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:40,010
strong incentive of getting luxury and

590
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:42,889
reward and priority access that still

591
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:44,240
drives this economy forward as some of

592
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,960
the best parts that we've seen in

593
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,360
capitalism but in capitalism you want to

594
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,140
prevent Free Riders and that then causes

595
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,199
a rift in values between people that is

596
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,490
oftentimes irreconcilable is

597
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,659
miscommunicated because then what do you

598
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,840
do with the Free Riders well this

599
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:04,340
economy actually says we don't that

600
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,070
we're not going to try and prevent Free

601
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:10,250
Riders we just want to have the best

602
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:13,309
biggest givers and as long as his post

603
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:15,049
scarce goods Free Riders get those

604
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:17,600
things and that naturally actually

605
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:20,168
drives entrepreneurs to look at what are

606
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,879
currently scarce goods and how can they

607
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:27,710
automate manufacturing in order to give

608
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:31,539
it to more people still got problems

609
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,539
I still got problems the last problem

610
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,960
great mark

611
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,520
this sounds utopic I really is anybody

612
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,090
gonna use this and you're gonna do I

613
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:57,930
mean with why we exist in reality right

614
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:01,110
this is not practical so how do you

615
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:05,700
solve for any economic system the

616
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:10,979
problem of adoption you use the previous

617
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:12,600
economic system right now we got

618
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,270
capitalism and capitalism has this

619
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:20,820
really cool function of competition that

620
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:22,440
drives profit down to zero in hopes for

621
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,230
a lot of these companies like uber which

622
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,360
is subsidizing the price from investors

623
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:30,000
or Amazon which is subsidizing the price

624
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,860
for future customer attention they do it

625
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,420
on the hopes of eventually killing off

626
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,629
the competitors so they can then Jack

627
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,370
the prices up as a monopoly so it's

628
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,680
weird because if like it the the

629
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:43,320
competitive nature of capitalism leads

630
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,750
to benefit for consumers which is zero

631
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,610
profit margins on the companies such

632
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,460
that it's a better deal for the cut the

633
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:52,139
consumers but if that company is too

634
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,100
successful in their job they become a

635
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,900
monopoly and now prices get jacked up

636
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,730
you can't totalitarianism you get all

637
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:03,780
the things that we are afraid of that

638
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:05,370
governments themselves do so let me tell

639
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,980
you a little bit story okay right like

640
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:09,570
okay we actually we have we have an

641
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,870
economic force in capitalism is already

642
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:15,840
driving things towards free Alice and

643
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:18,479
Bob are two ice cream stores across the

644
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,720
street from each other Bob has the

645
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,350
superior product Alice is clever and

646
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,170
ruthless

647
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:29,300
she's an industrialist she knows out how

648
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:32,760
to go out in the world and conquer so

649
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,800
she realizes hahaha I'll just slash my

650
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,990
prices in half

651
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,820
what's Bob gonna do socially slashes her

652
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:42,600
prices in half and and even though Bob's

653
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,550
got the superior product ah people on a

654
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,709
price point alone wind up driving more

655
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,690
customers towards Alice and Bob has to

656
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:53,690
retaliate

657
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:57,510
no sabab lowers his prices as well

658
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:59,320
so now Alice's screwed she's at her

659
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:01,220
endgame

660
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,860
[Music]

661
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:11,390
Alice is even more clever she's like

662
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:13,889
haha if I give free ice cream to my

663
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:18,600
patrons in exchange for the Marais ting

664
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:22,770
me on Google Maps and Yelp then people

665
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,030
will see that I'm a superior product

666
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,100
because they're gonna see my higher

667
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:28,350
ratings on you up well Bob's not listed

668
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,689
this is already happening today like

669
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:33,570
historically i-i've gotten so many free

670
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:36,120
goods at restaurants to rate them on

671
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,740
Yelp and Google Maps and Yelp hate this

672
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,719
because they act as a central bank and

673
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,220
they're trying to control the legitimacy

674
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,200
of their currency but the issue is the

675
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,450
economics are inevitable it is a win for

676
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,290
me as the customers a win for Alice as

677
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:53,180
the store so good luck central banks of

678
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:56,159
reputation I strongly III do not condone

679
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:58,470
reputation systems they very easily lead

680
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,090
to dystopic systems but it's it's easy

681
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:03,020
for us to think about this and the

682
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:06,270
evolutionary forces of adoption stone

683
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,280
bob sees the strategy that alice is

684
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:10,620
doing and of course adopts it gives a

685
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,210
free ice cream away in order to get

686
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:18,000
ratings something fascinating has

687
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:24,000
happened at this point every single

688
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,600
store owner every business is now

689
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,290
accepting this kind of implicit

690
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:35,040
reputation currency imagine if Bitcoin

691
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:37,610
was accepted everywhere right like like

692
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,139
the power of a currency is in its

693
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:42,120
distribution and its network effect and

694
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:45,629
Bitcoin got that so right with a

695
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,190
deflationary mechanics that drove

696
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:50,850
adoption brilliant like brilliant

697
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:52,380
brilliant but once everybody in the

698
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,969
economy is already using reputation

699
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,690
systems which hey we are Google Maps

700
00:34:53,969 --> 00:35:01,089
Yelp whatever that new type of currency

701
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:03,550
which I do not I do not condone

702
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:08,940
our DEA's widespread adoption so Alice

703
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:12,400
with her ruthless ideology realizes oh I

704
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,920
can get free milk from the grocery store

705
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,590
I can get free eggs from the grocery

706
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:22,480
store if I rate them highly so Alice

707
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:24,070
decides to bet everything in all the

708
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,140
store she goes to anyways already

709
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:32,760
accepts reputation so she says I don't

710
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:35,730
accept dollar or Fiat or any scarce

711
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,220
currency that also includes

712
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:41,350
unfortunately Bitcoin bitcoin is

713
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,419
fundamentally the same type of currency

714
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,250
and that's why government's try to ban

715
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,190
it but they don't ban reputation systems

716
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:50,770
is because bitcoin is viewed as being

717
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,750
the same type of currency and it's

718
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:55,810
crushing it right it's like totally

719
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:58,450
bidding out these government's but

720
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:01,420
governments don't react to other types

721
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:04,930
of currencies so you're able to use the

722
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,270
previous economic system as a driving

723
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:15,129
force to get adoption for the new

724
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:18,430
economic systems so what's going on here

725
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:22,180
we spent a year doing a research into

726
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:24,310
what are these problems in economics how

727
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:29,140
can we model things what are the math

728
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:33,730
behind them and we weigh over our heads

729
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:36,069
uh-huh this is a new branch of economics

730
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:37,710
this is a new branch of science and the

731
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:40,660
reason why I say this is because

732
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:44,070
capitalism is defined as the production

733
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:46,690
of goods as controlled by private owners

734
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:49,570
socialism is defined as the distribution

735
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:55,120
of goods as controlled by the public

736
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:58,590
state free ism is defined as the

737
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:03,520
production and distribution of goods

738
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:04,840
incentivized through algorithm that

739
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,390
should terrify you

740
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:12,040
whose algorithms whose writing an

741
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:14,500
algorithm absolutely admit that even in

742
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:17,290
the work that we're doing on this branch

743
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,660
free ism we have found this new

744
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:22,180
continent and we're giving it a name we

745
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,460
haven't explored all of the routes and

746
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:28,569
we've thought very deeply about it but I

747
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,400
my intuition is that if free ISM as I've

748
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,830
defined it or to be implemented by

749
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,860
Facebook we would get a really bad

750
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:39,819
dystopic system but if it was also

751
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:42,370
implemented by a government say China we

752
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:46,600
would also get a very scary or dystopic

753
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:49,330
system what that means is that that the

754
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,950
only middle ground for free ism of all

755
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:53,529
the possible branches we could explore

756
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:56,049
inside of it that might actually result

757
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,210
in a society that we want that is about

758
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:00,910
human flourishing and then the embedment

759
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:05,640
of humanity is through a completely

760
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:09,759
voluntary and decentralized approach and

761
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:13,359
we have the mechanisms to drive that

762
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,400
adoption that straddles both sides of

763
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:18,010
the political divide and takes the

764
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:22,690
values from both camps that are arguing

765
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:26,470
so viciously against each other in this

766
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:31,360
zero-sum political game that is got

767
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:33,669
scarcity as its game mechanic and we're

768
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:37,090
saying no what if we go to a win-win

769
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:40,150
system we can get people to opt out of

770
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:42,750
money not only for fun getting free

771
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:48,960
stuff but also for profit getting

772
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:52,300
freedom so our team

773
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,630
Marty Malmi the very first contributors

774
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:58,510
to Satoshi dr. amber Cazale a visiting

775
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:01,150
scholar at Stanford doing psychology me

776
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,400
running the decentralized protocol with

777
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:05,350
millions of users as we look forward

778
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,760
into the future we're trying to take

779
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,160
these equations that I've showed you

780
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:12,070
today and in probably about two years

781
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:14,589
from now once we're at 1% of the world's

782
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:17,350
population start experimenting with

783
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:19,180
these economic simulations we've already

784
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:23,140
done that we are already doing modeling

785
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:25,419
on and putting in practice with hundreds

786
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,440
of millions if not billions of people so

787
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:31,369
I would like to

788
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:34,970
warmly ask you that I want a handshake

789
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:38,420
with you you have connections I have

790
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:43,368
connections if we can team up and opt

791
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:47,660
out perhaps we can create a society that

792
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:51,829
is more free as in freedom for people

793
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:54,170
but also more free as in universal

794
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:58,089
healthcare without all the bad stigma

795
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:03,470
associated with so to end on this note

796
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:06,078
my response to Karl Marx and Adam Smith

797
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:08,299
a treatise of free economics free on eco

798
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,910
I'm tweeting about this a lot on Twitter

799
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,200
so please jump in and ask me really

800
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,660
challenging questions because we need

801
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:18,740
that but at the very beginning as I

802
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:22,578
stated if money is the tool to get the

803
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:25,339
lifestyle that we want then economics is

804
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:28,069
a tool that can get us the society that

805
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:31,759
we want so look at each other

806
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:36,400
shake hands find what is beautiful and

807
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:42,729
cultivate that in all of us thank you

808
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,729
[Applause]

809
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:49,699
okay mark thank you for your talk

810
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,009
I very believe it was inspirational for

811
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:58,160
some of you and the audience now is your

812
00:40:52,009 --> 00:41:00,349
turn so any question Mike thanks a lot

813
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,709
for this talk and for presenting your

814
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:05,949
thoughts so clear and straight I have

815
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:08,828
one question which is related to

816
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:11,029
marginal production costs because

817
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:13,099
obviously also streaming the YouTube

818
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:16,369
video has some electricity bill that has

819
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:20,839
to be paid and as long as you apply this

820
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:24,859
to this to a non scarcity world it would

821
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:28,549
like make directly what would be

822
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:31,640
directed applicable but as long as you

823
00:41:28,549 --> 00:41:33,499
have marginal costs I'm just interested

824
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,890
in how you think about that and how you

825
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:38,118
apply that to your model currently

826
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,469
absolutely super super important

827
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,079
question and I'm gonna answer with

828
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:46,999
capitalism right which is there's an

829
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:50,420
economic incentive for whatever for

830
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:52,939
Arizona to offer Elon Musk with the

831
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,640
Tesla plant subsidized deals to build

832
00:41:52,939 --> 00:41:57,589
the power plant in Arizona I think it's

833
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,979
I think it's in Arizona so we're already

834
00:41:57,589 --> 00:42:03,709
seeing this idea that you kind of Wine

835
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:07,098
and Dine powerful people and give them

836
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:10,788
cheaper rates in order to kind of

837
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:13,069
inherit that reputation same thing like

838
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:15,319
if you get a deal with Amazon Web

839
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:16,849
Services where you're supplying the

840
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:18,679
electricity for Amazon Web Services you

841
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:22,009
know it's in high demand so it is

842
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:24,349
advantageous for you to offer perhaps a

843
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:26,599
discounted rate the sweet thing about

844
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:28,489
this post economic model or some of the

845
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:30,499
equations I know I'm not gonna skip back

846
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:32,689
is it actually formalized as this right

847
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:34,819
it was the example of Alice helping Bob

848
00:42:32,689 --> 00:42:39,019
and Bob helping Alice Bob has an

849
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:43,489
incentive to give Alice free food even

850
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:47,718
if Alice gives Bob a much much much much

851
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:50,569
lower daily percent value because Alice

852
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:53,179
is helping so many people that even a

853
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,660
smaller percent value then at the second

854
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:58,170
handshake deep rep

855
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:01,740
a much larger increase in Bob's value

856
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:03,630
setting answer possibly either come to

857
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,240
you later about but just keep in mind

858
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:08,910
that in a experimental phase on the

859
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,740
boundaries of your network this will be

860
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:14,670
a very critical point you have to

861
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:16,500
consider you got me there yeah well yeah

862
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,480
you know because I I did a greater than

863
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,480
and in do greater than equal so at the

864
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:26,630
point of one ooh okay thank you thank

865
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:29,730
you for putting it out okay anybody else

866
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:37,410
so no questions from the audience

867
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:38,700
tonight okay they did it um so yeah

868
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,710
thanks again for the talk you see you

869
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,839
mentioned I'm a bunch of times about how

870
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:44,970
people should tell you how they value

871
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,280
things by giving them a percent value on

872
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:50,009
can you sort of explain how that's

873
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,110
calculated one of the things we look

874
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,670
about we think about in in economics is

875
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:56,430
that what people tell you how much they

876
00:43:53,670 --> 00:44:00,120
value that is a cheap signal right I can

877
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:02,430
tell you that your power of gold is

878
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,799
worthless its value at zero percent of

879
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:06,750
my value um but if I actually have to

880
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,160
make an expensive signal of trading

881
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,690
something that I value highly for it

882
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,730
then I can actually discover the price

883
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:13,530
so I'm really like it seems that's sort

884
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,670
of glossed over here and like so how do

885
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,890
you how do you solve that problem it's

886
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,830
glossed over because we ran like ten

887
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:23,100
different approaches and this one seemed

888
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:24,540
to be the best fit but I absolutely want

889
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,100
to continue the conversation because

890
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:30,750
there are so many different ways that

891
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:33,060
you can measure value that any like any

892
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:35,190
tiny factor in any of this system just

893
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,529
slightly off could throw the whole

894
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:42,210
economics out of whack so this was kind

895
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:46,500
of our best guess with the approaches we

896
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:49,290
tried but it could go wrong more than

897
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,790
happy to continue the reason why that

898
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:54,690
was our best guess and it basically

899
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:57,840
boils down to when I'm handing over

900
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,760
Bitcoin and I get to decide the price of

901
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,800
Bitcoin I'm gonna cheat the system

902
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,080
because bitcoins are scarce good

903
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,330
but if daily percent values aren't

904
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,650
really the scarce thing you might

905
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,130
initially at the beginning of the

906
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,840
network

907
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,400
at the boundary have people who feel

908
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,660
like they want to cheat the system but

909
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,830
over time they're fundamentally not

910
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:18,509
losing anything and so our our intuition

911
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:21,540
compared to other systems that had worse

912
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:24,090
results is that people would stop

913
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,190
cheating and become more honest or if

914
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:27,990
everybody is dishonest and the average

915
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:31,380
is out in the calculations anyways and

916
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:33,569
then like another another piece is that

917
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,060
there's also still the right of refusal

918
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:37,530
in the system I mean maybe that gets

919
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,560
banned about like in my head there's

920
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,870
still the right of refusal so if

921
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,940
somebody's coming back and wants my free

922
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:48,540
groceries and keeps on writing me at 0%

923
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,670
0% 0% I'm gonna be like okay maybe I'm

924
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:54,120
gonna start discriminating against you

925
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:56,190
that doesn't sound nice or good but then

926
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,890
there's a flipside which is if people if

927
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:02,010
there's collusion on the produce on the

928
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:04,319
distributor's they can potentially say

929
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,150
I'm not gonna give you this good unless

930
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,970
you give me a really high value so

931
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:11,040
they're yeah really good question if you

932
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,140
if you have explored this and have

933
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,500
answers please talk to us this is all

934
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:18,720
new stuff I'm presenting my best

935
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,120
intuitions and the simulations we've

936
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,890
done but I'm not an authority nobody's

937
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,660
authority on pretty as I'm yet so please

938
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,060
challenge me i we need to find holes

939
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:34,069
before we implement it in two years from

940
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:37,290
now okay this is the last one

941
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:39,150
what do you do about human evil I'm

942
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:41,100
talking about people who don't care

943
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:44,010
about your rational options you're

944
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:51,839
pretty pretty landscapes they want

945
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:54,510
something way beyond anything normal or

946
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,990
humane or anything they want they don't

947
00:46:54,510 --> 00:47:00,810
want just your belief they want your

948
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:04,229
immortal soul and they will kill to get

949
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:08,160
it and nothing absolutely nothing you

950
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:12,320
say or present or offer will deter them

951
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,319
these are psychopathic

952
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,320
murdering fiends and these people exist

953
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:20,020
in the world yeah what do you do about

954
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,220
them so there's two it answers that I'm

955
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,680
gonna skip to the second one the first

956
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,029
one has to do with more libertarian

957
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,470
values but I think what you're actually

958
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:30,400
asking is a history question more than

959
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:32,589
an economic question that assuming yeah

960
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,970
so I'm gonna answer it with history you

961
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:37,840
see the balkanization

962
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:40,629
of the world as technology increases and

963
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:43,000
you see world wars play out in their own

964
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:44,850
microcosm so with Western civilization

965
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,570
you get world war one world war two

966
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,110
fighting against each other and it's

967
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:49,510
terrible

968
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:51,070
they have fundamentally driven ideology

969
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,210
that doesn't care about the economics

970
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,250
underneath no matter how good the

971
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:56,670
economics are you're seeing the same

972
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:58,420
thing play out in the Middle East that

973
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:00,240
effectively the Middle East is playing

974
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,940
on its own world war one world war two

975
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,470
inheriting a lot of the technology from

976
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,670
Rohan world war two of the different

977
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,490
governments that are sponsoring this

978
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:13,840
faction groups so a key thing to

979
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:18,009
understand is that that's disgusting all

980
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:21,340
of it and sad but a lot of the children

981
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:23,260
in these conflicts are getting seduced

982
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:25,390
by capitalism the getting seduced by

983
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:28,450
Starbucks being on every corner

984
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:30,100
most children revolt maybe maybe you

985
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,509
call that an evil itself most children

986
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:34,029
revolt against their parents and they

987
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:36,340
wonder why on earth are they out dying

988
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:39,180
on this bloody battlefield when I could

989
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:41,440
be sipping tea so there's a very

990
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:44,649
seductive process for each one these

991
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,880
economic problem routes that I think the

992
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:50,910
children want to sacrifice less so that

993
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,560
is not an economic model that's just a

994
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:55,540
change in morality and I think history

995
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:59,740
has shown us that even the greatest evil

996
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:02,920
can be trumped by a child that has

997
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:07,200
either better ambition or can be seduced

998
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,200
by a more tantalizing future

999
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:20,320
that is not happening in England or

1000
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:23,410
France where Muslim children are

1001
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:26,110
becoming more radicalized than their you

1002
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:28,450
know fairly relatively relaxed parents

1003
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:30,880
socialism and capitalism is a scarce

1004
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:33,730
game so I'm not wrong about socialism

1005
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,620
and profits on radicalization you've

1006
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,600
because yeah in order to gain money from

1007
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:40,120
somebody else I have to make them make a

1008
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,740
decision but and that talk about

1009
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,940
socialism in capitalism

1010
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:47,490
I'm talking about human beings and

1011
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:54,310
Satanists like these are bloodthirsty

1012
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:56,589
maniacs it's like it's so far the models

1013
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,549
that you've presented don't contain what

1014
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:00,490
I'm talking about

1015
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:02,050
that is true um neither to capitalism or

1016
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,370
socialism so my hope is that maybe we

1017
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:05,590
can experiment with free ism in France

1018
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:08,020
and see how it impacts the moral

1019
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:09,670
decisions to people and honestly I do

1020
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,410
wish people who are less violent but I'm

1021
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,700
also a volunteer US I don't want to I

1022
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,460
don't want to use violence to force

1023
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:17,980
people to be less violent so I feel like

1024
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,140
that is the point at which I become evil

1025
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,760
and I'd rather avoid that right good

1026
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,000
point okay

1027
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,550
so mark thank you for your presentation

1028
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,530
and for your thoughts that you are

1029
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:31,840
sharing with us and also thank you for

1030
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:34,810
your questions I would like to just

1031
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:37,240
point out that Mark asked you to

1032
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:40,509
challenge him so definitely Congress is

1033
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:43,180
not ending so continue find him anywhere

1034
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:44,970
around the place I think that that's the

1035
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:49,410
that's the way how it should be done and

1036
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:49,410
Mark thank you thank you

1037
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,580
you
