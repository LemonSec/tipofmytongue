who gathered for this event we despite

16
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:49,030
the fact that we increase the price of

17
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,789
the ticket in order to professionalize

18
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:56,899
organization of h cpp we were

19
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,990
fortunately able to to be completely

20
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:03,460
sold out one I think one month before

21

see you see you here again and regarding

26
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:37,010
the topic opt out so with we think that

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:42,410
we we decided or we decided to choose

28
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:44,239
this slogan or this topic of HTTP very

29
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,519
carefully because we were surprised that

30
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,650
so many so many speakers in their

31
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:51,140
presentation they decided to reflect

32
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,590
this topic opt out so we had a

33
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,160
presentation how to opt out of the

34
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,330
system for example

35
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:04,780
just by moving to some other country or

36
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:09,430
to create some autonomous zone or just

37
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:12,330
to be self-sustainable using pearl

38
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,940
garden so so we're really happy that

39
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:19,770
most speakers they they understood

40
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:22,800
what's going on and they decided to

41
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:26,760
decided to create presentation that

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,130
reflect that reflected the opt-out

43
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,799
slogan we are also pleased that

44
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,470
increasing number of you is coming and

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,690
asking what can I do to start parallel

46
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,380
policies in my city in my town I would

47
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,359
like to have something similar we are

48
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,790
very pleased for it and I would like to

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,890
remind that we've launched here the

50
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,040
project decent track which is the

51
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,829
easiest and smoothest way how to create

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,400
a trial parallel Poly's in your in your

53
00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:01,209
city so you can just start to think

54
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,510
where when and how it could be done and

55
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:07,660
you will gain all the possible support

56
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:12,519
from our part to get the truck there to

57
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:16,870
spend some time and make people come and

58
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,668
test their interest test how much they

59
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,810
would be participating on the bigger

60
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:25,690
project and made them dependent on nice

61
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:29,560
environment of like-minded people so

62
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:32,260
after the truck goes away they want to

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,110
they don't want it to disappear and they

64
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,360
will likely help you with establishing

65
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,620
pearl policies in your town so decent

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,800
truck is basically portable mobile small

67
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:48,190
version of pearl police and if you want

68
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,740
if you want just to make a or test trial

69
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:54,460
version of your parolees in your city

70
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,460
don't hesitate to call us or invite us

71
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,289
and bill that it will become so help us

72
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,859
to spread the word help us with the

73
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:09,130
crowdfunding to establish it and it will

74
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:11,310
get propolis closer and last thing we

75
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,500
would like to mention is

76
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,289
it's obvious that journalism media are

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,319
more and more interested in topics we

78
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:22,870
are focused on our congress's this year

79
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,810
we had I think the largest number of

80
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:29,830
speakers who are journalists or who

81
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,930
refer about problems with media and we

82
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,359
can clearly see it globally that it's

83
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,629
it's increasing problem how to gain

84
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,789
independent information so I think all

85
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:43,659
our community should take responsibility

86
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:46,180
and help journalists to remain

87
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:51,780
independent - or to gain independence a

88
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:54,610
to stay secure and to support them in in

89
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,500
situations when they're oppressed in

90
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,009
different ways that we can see in news

91
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:04,659
we think that especially the topic

92
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:08,440
opt-out is very important very important

93
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:12,099
to increase antifragility of many people

94
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,919
especially in the situation where there

95
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:18,759
is a threat for the authorative system

96
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:22,659
dictatorship regime in in many places of

97
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:27,099
the world so I think that the thought or

98
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:29,469
idea to have a possibility to opt-out is

99
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:32,550
extremely important in these days and it

100
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:35,889
will be much important in the future and

101
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:40,050
we would like to pass the word to tomash

102
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:42,880
Coleman who is the person that is fully

103
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,310
focused to make the vol Congress happen

104
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,039
he's the main coordinator and he

105
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:52,120
tomorrow he wakes up and he will start

106
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:54,568
thinking how 2020 will look like highly

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,569
probably

108
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:12,940
okay thanks so it's been great event

109
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:15,220
it's finished almost so I would like to

110
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,590
thank couple of people and partners

111
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,480
because there have been so many people

112
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,880
working their butts off behind the

113
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,850
scenes and last two years I didn't

114
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:29,320
prepare the list and I left few names

115
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:32,050
out so this year I'm a bit prepared i I

116
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,400
think from organizational perspective so

117
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,670
I'm so happy because we had this

118
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,130
emergency number which was part of the

119
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,260
leaflet with all the badges and that

120
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,330
cell phone is in my pocket and it

121
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,120
remained silent for the all three days

122
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,789
so I'm that this really demonstrates

123
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,050
that it's been smooth and I hope that

124
