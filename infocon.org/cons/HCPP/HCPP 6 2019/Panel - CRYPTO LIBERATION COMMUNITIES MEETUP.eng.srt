00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,390
did you hear me okay cool sir good

4
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,759
afternoon ladies and gentlement I'm

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,940
really happy I was able to organize this

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,430
crypto liberation community Meetup

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,370
so the thing is why I decided to do to

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,000
do that so the first thing is that

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,250
crypto liberation movement is booming

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,100
everywhere at least I perceive it in

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,110
this way and also crypto liberation

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,530
communities are growing in many

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,580
different countries especially in we

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,010
consider in Europe

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:00,730
not only in Czech Republic Slovakia but

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:03,940
also in Germany in Spain in Austria and

17
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:08,740
I hope in any many many other countries

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:12,250
and that was the reason that I decided

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,229
to you to invite representative of this

20
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:18,759
krypter krypter liberation communities

21
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:23,020
to this discussion panel and all these

22
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:27,119
people will present you the project or

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:30,610
place that are building and also the

24
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:35,310
interesting project are there our focus

25
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:38,650

52
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:22,269
Kosice slovakia so guys thank you a lot

53
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:24,159
for coming here for being here and now

54
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,349
it's your turn so I would like to ask

55
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,989
you to present your community maybe five

56
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:30,369
minutes ten minutes

57
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:38,769
some of you have slides so it don't

58
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:43,199
hesitate to use them hello ok perfect so

59
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:47,889
I have some pictures from pearl police

60
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:51,340
Bratislava parallel Napoli's we tend to

61
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:53,530
use the local language version so in

62
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,569
Barcelona it will it will be polished

63
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:01,269
parallelize so we kind of try to adapt

64
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:04,509
to local environment and here you can

65
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:08,859
see you can see the Bitcoin coffee as

66
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:13,869
you can see it it's a 1:1 larger

67
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:16,539
building we don't have a good separation

68
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,030
of coffee so in the back you see

69
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:24,240
Institute of krypton are here and and

70
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:28,090
our co-working spaces on the small small

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,699
floor that you can climb up the stairs

72
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,400
we call it the moon because we believe

73
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:38,979
that every step you take to the moon and

74
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:40,719
brings crypto to the moon and what I

75
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:43,539
want why I wanted to show you this

76
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:45,639
picture is because you can recognize the

77
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:48,900
concepts of the original parallel police

78
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:52,020
in in Prague we try to

79
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,560
replicate all the ideas and the

80
00:04:52,020 --> 00:05:01,409
interactions between the spaces I think

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:05,190
it is very important that these parts of

82
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:08,220
parallel volleys police work together so

83
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,800
I don't think it makes much sense to

84
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,510
create just an institute of crypto honor

85
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,389
he because you can have a hacker space

86
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,139
and it could be much cheaper even if you

87
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:22,500
if you want to just do talks you can

88
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:24,540
rent a room with a projector and do

89
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,740
talks in a pub anywhere it doesn't

90
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,450
matter so what makes parallel police is

91
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,479
using these interactions of different

92
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,060
parts and and kind of letting it

93
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:40,200
interact but also you can see that this

94
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:45,930
place is very different to Prague so the

95
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:49,110
reason is that that the space and the

96
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,090
space itself but also the community is

97
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,650
generated by the people that are there

98
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,700
and people have different interests

99
00:05:52,650 --> 00:06:01,799
different approach to things so we try

100
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:04,130
to be different as well we try to try to

101
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,080
experiment with different approaches and

102
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:10,680
we hope that with all these crypto

103
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,530
communities we can get inspired so for

104
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,289
example after discussions with smuggler

105
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:21,450
and other people from Berlin we realized

106
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:23,159
that our naive version of all we will

107
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,409
liberate everyone because that's

108
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,200
obviously what everyone needs more

109
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,479
freedom everyone is striving for that we

110
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,419
realized that actually most people don't

111
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,330
care about freedom at all and it's about

112
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,760
finding the right people who who

113
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:42,810
actually strive for more freedom and

114
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:45,450
it's our job to show them how to how to

115
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:53,010
achieve it how to how to get it so we

116
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:57,150
also do talks with speakers this is

117
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:59,599
bubbles talk on getting more financial

118
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,599
freedom I think

119
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:10,269
taken from the moon so there's some some

120
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:12,369
other other talks and what we are trying

121
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:15,189
to build here is something that is

122
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:19,209
inspired by the the idea of parallel

123
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:23,229
police by the the physical space here in

124
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:25,569
Prague but we also try to implement

125
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:32,258
other ideas from other communities such

126
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:35,799
as you hear about we also finally

127
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:38,639
painted the building black and put up

128
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:42,998
the logo I think this is very

129
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,379
interesting part of what what we do and

130
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:46,269
what is actually different to other

131
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:51,639
communities that try to stay more

132
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:54,699
private so a lot of people when they

133
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:58,179
when they talk about parallel police day

134
00:07:54,699 --> 00:08:00,699
they say ok the only reason why you can

135
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:03,669
do this idea of parallel societies

136
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:05,889
because you live in a free liberal

137
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,758
democracy and it allows parallel

138
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:12,999
societies that's not true it allows us

139
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,309
to have a nice building with a sign but

140
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:21,149
parallel societies were actually common

141
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:24,879
in horrible regimes in in states like

142
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:27,849
like China there were tanks which were

143
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,209
temporary autonomous zones and

144
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,979
communities of people that could not put

145
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,769
a sign on the building they were hiding

146
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:40,419
from the state and what I wanted to

147
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:45,009
mention that this strategy works in any

148
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:47,980
kind of environment I'm I'm positive

149
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:50,740
that it could work in in in a much worse

150
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:54,449
much less free societies but the form

151
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:57,639
would be different and we are all here

152
00:08:54,449 --> 00:09:00,399
these people we are trying to find the

153
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,079
form that works in the particular

154
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,990
environment and in their particular

155
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,059
community so that's why I think this is

156
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,990
very inspiring

157
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:13,980
we like to relax we will

158
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:17,339
to competitions about logos and merge so

159
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,730
we kind of tried to grow and experiment

160
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:24,380
with other things we also had a visit

161
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:26,790
from the police in our opening party

162
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,430
which was very interesting because I'm

163
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,589
sure that they believed that they landed

164
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,079
on the moon because they couldn't

165
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:36,600
comprehend what's going on and other

166
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:44,279
people are talking about so they were

167
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:47,790
happy to leave if you would like to

168
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:50,070
experience the space the best thing you

169
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:54,089
can do is to come to Bratislava and

170
00:09:50,070 --> 00:10:00,209
visit it during an event if you cannot

171
00:09:54,089 --> 00:10:03,720
do it or are a proponent of an eco

172
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:06,060
religion and you think that it's a that

173
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,839
you're killing our planet by travelling

174
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:12,420
to Bratislava then you can try our VR

175
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,430
experience where you can just see it

176
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:18,270
with your opponents kind of look around

177
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:21,239
so if the few pictures doesn't make

178
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,860
don't make just this to the place you

179
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,120
can explore it yourselves but please

180
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,400
come that's much better

181
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:34,490
so thank you thank you

182
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:34,490
[Applause]

183
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:41,620
okay I'm from Berlin and we do something

184
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,630
a little bit different than parallel

185
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,990
knee and parallel nopales and all the

186
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:50,890
other policies we were specifically

187
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:54,070
trying to experiment with shipping

188
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:56,620
containers community and combine that

189
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:06,610
into a model to run temporary autonomous

190
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:08,620
zones next slide okay so number one what

191
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,500
we're trying to do out of these

192
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:16,510
containers to see creators surveillance

193
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:18,640
free or low surveillance zone you're I

194
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,500
mean countermeasures that we're

195
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,199
developing against surveillance like

196
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:27,130
even acoustic surveillance and video and

197
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,260
whatever we try to have a little bit of

198
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,650
our own security so we don't need to

199
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:35,640
call the police a thing goes wrong we're

200
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:39,630
trying to experiment a little bit with

201
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:42,640
how one could run physical communities

202
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:45,040
without the state that is one of the

203
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,500
reasons we use the shipping containers

204
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,800
because you can own your own container

205
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,750
your own piece of the whole and if you

206
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,490
don't like it anymore or you don't like

207
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,400
your neighbor you can just move and you

208
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:01,390
don't have to involve complicated court

209
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:05,860
processes or fight publicly or anything

210
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:08,590
like that because we're we're trying to

211
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,900
keep it as state free as possible

212
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:14,350
including what can be done there or

213
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:17,100
cannot be done there and we use these

214
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:20,770
shipping containers that allow us to

215
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,290
shoot the escalation with the state

216
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,840
become a little bit too high we can pack

217
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:30,040
up everything and move somewhere else

218
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,440
without losing capital one thing we

219
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,959
really suck at but we really try it and

220
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,330
that is building community so we're not

221
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,060
very baker like 10 11 12 people or

222
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,590
something like that however those people

223
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:46,109
that we half are really cool and we have

224
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:49,560
relationships and there are a lot of

225
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:52,830
like smaller projects in the context of

226
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,670
building such a daisy so thinking about

227
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,590
anti-surveillance technology but also

228
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:04,339
fixing roofs and building roofs and

229
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:04,340
solar panels and famous toilet projects

230
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:12,960
this is from one of the meetups we did

231
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,930
you see the containers from the outside

232
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,150
and the some of them are built out some

233
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,859
are not but they will be soon hopefully

234
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:24,240
we're saying they're for the last two

235
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:27,690
years and we're having an Ultima air

236
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:32,310
event there and very famous is our stake

237
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:40,620
reactor so if you like meat we have the

238
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:43,010
best way to make meat so okay this thing

239
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,010
doesn't work

240
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,730
give you one more fleece then you have

241
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:00,189
justice light yeah there was less

242
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,190
develop poverty

243
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:23,689
okay okay it's not this thing it's my

244
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:26,380
presentation format anyways I'm gonna

245
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,340
continue without slides

246
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,140
apart from building your shipping

247
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:34,300
containers and everything that belongs

248
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:37,670
to it we have a membership based model

249
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:41,510
so you can become a member after

250
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:44,089
convincing us that you're cool and be

251
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:49,910
convincing you that you're cool we are

252
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:54,260
cool and exactly more I go to the last

253
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:56,060
slide and it involves a fee of course

254
00:14:54,260 --> 00:15:01,910
there's a small fee

255
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:05,780
the famous containers toilets then we

256
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:08,120
have weekly meet ups of everyday work

257
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:11,089
and social get together and stuff like

258
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,630
that we have a monthly public meetup

259
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:21,100
that we actually announced on meet-up

260
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:24,110
calm icy cypherpunk meetup plus that

261
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,490
various space where our members can hang

262
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:30,230
out anytime they want

263
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:34,400
24/7 hack sleep there which apparently

264
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:36,640
is a common behavior or just you know

265
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,760
have a good time with people you trust

266
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,760
thank you

267
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:53,250
Thank You Las York your turn said

268
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,930
working it's working I also to be quite

269
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,510
honest I didn't actually know that room

270
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:00,359
77 was a crypto liberation community

271
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:03,810
until I received the invite to this

272
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,120
panel yeah but I think what we also can

273
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,739
see here that crypto Liberation

274
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,660
communities whatever the definition is

275
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,550
look quite different quite interesting

276
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,029
actually if you would see if I would

277
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,469
have brought pictures of room 77 now

278
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:18,960
what I just found really interesting is

279
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,570
that the parallel Poly's and other

280
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,750
places in Eastern Europe all look really

281
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:33,420
stylish designers and green whereas

282
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:34,890
every it's intentional it must have been

283
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,160
some kind of aesthetics I think actually

284
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:44,270
the Berliners served the cypherpunk

285
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:47,430
aesthetics better than you anyway

286
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,860
so yeah I brought no presentation I can

287
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:54,510
I can just spend a few minutes to talk

288
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:56,850
about room 77 what that is 15 years ago

289
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,069
a friend of mine and I opened a bar and

290
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,860
restaurant just for fun we wanted to

291
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:04,800
have our own place for a for a year or

292
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:09,689
so we could play music and yeah have our

293
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,938
own bar which was very easily doable in

294
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,650
Berlin and in certain parts of Berlin at

295
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,079
the time because you could like really

296
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:21,890
rent a place a bar a restaurant for kind

297
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:24,839
of pocket money for change okay it's

298
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,730
yeah obviously the place ran for a

299
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,780
little longer than a year than it was

300
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,220
planned which had to do with a

301
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,350
gastronomical success of it anyhow five

302
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,270
years later or six years later Bitcoin

303
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,610
comes around it was actually around the

304
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:45,200
time we started thinking about we should

305
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:47,820
finally sell that place how did this

306
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,540
rock and roll bar and restaurant then

307
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:55,790
turn into this kind of hub for Bitcoin

308
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,790
crypto blockchain people

309
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:04,659
the the initial moment was when we

310
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,490
started accepting Bitcoin to find out

311
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,530
that we were literally the first bricks

312
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:14,320
and mortar business on the planet that

313
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:17,950
did so and back at the time any media

314
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,929
coverage about Bitcoin was literally

315
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,940
about drug dealers and and tax evasion

316
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:27,760
if you'd have an article about Bitcoin

317
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:32,020
the only images you could see was a

318
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:35,560
person like this from behind in front of

319
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:40,270
a screen with source code on it you know

320
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:43,540
and anyhow when word got around let me

321
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:46,240
let me say first for the really really

322
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,790
tiny Bitcoin community I mean you

323
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,040
literally knew everybody on the planet

324
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:54,580
somehow through the forums you knew

325
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,970
every project anybody was doing on

326
00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:02,760
Bitcoin so first of all the the the

327
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:06,760
early Bitcoin community was absolutely

328
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,980
delighted about the fact that somebody

329
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:13,570
is actually selling something physical

330
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,760
for for Bitcoin and the biggest effect

331
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:18,100
though was the media coverage because

332
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,310
that place then started attracting media

333
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,530
from all over the planet just for the

334
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:26,139
simple reason because they could go to

335
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,910
an actual place and talk to actual

336
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,750
people who would show their face into

337
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:34,030
the camera and who would explain like

338
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:37,030
that they're normal people doing normal

339
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:39,160
stuff like buying dinner or getting

340
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:43,379
drunk and at the end of the night pay in

341
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:48,640
Bitcoin so we were a big source of

342
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:51,310
pictures for the media back then so

343
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,120
these things develop their own dynamics

344
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:58,179
and of course the place attracted

345
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,070
Bitcoin us from all over Berlin and from

346
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,230
all over Germany and then there were I

347
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:05,110
think it was the summers of 2012 and

348
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,580
third and 13 we call like the crypto

349
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,409
summers in Berlin because you had

350
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,960
developers from all over the world

351
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:13,240
coming to Berlin to work together in

352
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,300
unannounced hackathons and stuff like

353
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,210
that anyhow that's how that's how that

354
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:23,050
place turned into what I now learned is

355
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:26,200
a crypto liberation community what is it

356
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:29,350
today because I think this was just the

357
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:34,060
history of the room I think today it

358
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:37,209
actually deserves that name because the

359
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:40,750
absolute main focus of the place and the

360
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:46,690
majority of its customers are bitcoiners

361
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:48,180
a few ethereum guys Manero people we

362
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,890
have the I say I believe the

363
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,940
longest-running monthly meetup on the

364
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:56,770
planet still running in Berlin on the

365
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,290
first Thursday of the month we have a

366
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:02,590
monaro meetup on the second Thursday we

367
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:05,440
have the secret Bitcoin meetup on the

368
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:07,139
3rd secret and in so far do never

369
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,940
mention it on social media please that

370
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,490
that the secret meetup is literally

371
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,980
there because when the Bitcoin price is

372
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,950
high we have so many journalists on the

373
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,810
official Meetup that bitcoin is actually

374
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,670
don't want to go there anymore and then

375
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:26,850
when the price is high bitcoin is go

376
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:29,650
through the secret anyhow but we also

377
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:33,129
have and what I find absolutely

378
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:37,290
incredible is no chases those people

379
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,290
have in pictures of the rupee thank you

380
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,469
what I find really absolutely

381
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:47,790
fascinating is that room 77 has turned

382
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:52,720
into a place where people experiment

383
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:54,550
with new technologies in Bitcoin so it's

384
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,380
quite regularly when you have a new

385
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,270
technology let me put it this way the

386
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:02,500
first mobile wallet was built by andreas

387
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:05,470
Shilpa because he saw the need to be

388
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,180
able to go to this place and pay for his

389
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,790
dinner without having to bring his

390
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,350
laptop like you know you have this kind

391
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,590
of experimenting field you think like

392
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,510
wow there's Bitcoin it's going to

393
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,250
conquer the world and it's there and

394
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,320
it's finished and then the first person

395
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,450
wants to pay in Bitcoin at your bar and

396
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,439
they start typing

397
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:27,120
in 34 digits there laptop and then when

398
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,010
I send a transaction in the laptop says

399
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,658
that's not a valid Bitcoin address

400
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:33,690
anyhow so mm-hmm

401
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:38,669
we had the first Bitcoin ATM I think in

402
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:41,700
Europe's there we had people we had a

403
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:46,649
lightning hackathon not at room 77 but

404
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:48,450
in Berlin organized by full mode but the

405
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:51,840
guys there turned up came there on a

406
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:53,760
Friday and said hey on Sunday evening we

407
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,830
would like to be able to pay at room 77

408
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,779
via the Lightning Network and they

409
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,428
worked for 48 hours and came on Sunday

410
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:04,680
evening installed their lightning

411
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:06,500
solution and we could pay via lightning

412
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:10,580
[Music]

413
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:15,330
actually the bottom line I think is that

414
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:18,870
what turned my bar into the place that

415
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:22,379
it is now today that wasn't me that was

416
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:25,830
actually the community that started

417
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:29,220
developing around it I I think rooms

418
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:32,399
what room 77 did was merely provide a

419
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,299
very early platform that was very

420
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:38,309
welcoming

421
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:42,418
that was very inviting to people where

422
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:44,100
people could feel free and and saw the

423
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:46,139
potential that they could bring in their

424
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,980
own ideas and built their own tech there

425
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:53,250
and this is this is going till today we

426
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:56,279
have like every year I see new members

427
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,529
new very creative and productive members

428
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,769
in that community coming in I meet new

429
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:04,409
people all the time and after a while

430
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:09,750
you realize that is such a beautiful

431
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:11,850
contribution to this community yeah so

432
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:16,080
as I said bottom line is we provided a

433
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:18,418
platform that just hit the sweet spot

434
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,519
and every Bitcoin er was like this is

435
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:23,370
the kind of place where I want to go the

436
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:26,340
interesting thing is to say that at the

437
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:28,408
end what I find out is that the good

438
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,029
people or let's say you have a lot of

439
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:31,700
people coming you have a lot of people

440
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:34,909
come and then

441
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,639
the community again it's they're not so

442
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:40,450
cool people who come and go and it's the

443
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:41,649
really cool people who come and stay

444
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,360
[Music]

445
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:46,340
which I also think can only the only

446
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,830
reason for that can be that it is

447
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:54,080
literally a community with its own kind

448
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:57,529
of ethos and morals ethics and ideals

449
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,980
and people who cannot quite follow these

450
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:02,690
yeah just come and look at it probably

451
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,600
lose some money because they thought

452
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,010
they come here to become Bitcoin

453
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,049
millionaires or something like that

454
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:11,000
and they don't do that and they leave

455
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,490
again

456
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:22,700
that's about all I can say about room 77

457
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:27,100
in this context I believe thank you now

458
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:29,600
but I was police brach I would like to

459
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,490
mention for the beginning that I don't

460
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,219
have any slides because obviously you

461
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,789
can attend all the premises of our

462
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:40,639
policy and see them with your own eyes

463
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:44,990
so I would like to sum up some recent

464
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:49,658
news and new projects that we try that

465
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:51,830
we hope you will have impact on

466
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:55,130
community life and will hopefully

467
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:58,418
enlarge it and deepen it so the first

468
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:03,679
one that is presented for a first time

469
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:05,809
here in a more like defined version is

470
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:10,960
the decent track that you can see on the

471
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:16,100
car chart decent track is a concept that

472
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:18,799
targets primarily towns and cities or

473
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,899
events like festivals all around Czech

474
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,250
Republic this was this year's mission to

475
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:28,840
to open it and to test it and the the

476
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:31,730
idea is basically to make a compressed

477
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:35,510
concept of pearl polish and its program

478
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:39,950
on wheels and be able to to come and set

479
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:42,950
it up anywhere basically so today this

480
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:45,470
year we have tested like four times on

481
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:48,020
some festivals how it

482
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:51,710
works and how people react the results

483
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:57,429
are very good so we've decided to make

484
00:26:51,710 --> 00:27:01,750
next steps and now we are going to push

485
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:06,710
crowdfunding to establish the track and

486
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:08,630
see where communities deserve the track

487
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:12,710
to come when I say deserve it means that

488
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:14,870
we will meet some activity of local

489
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:18,470
people that will really be attracted and

490
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:21,969
and interested the truck to come and

491
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:26,000
will help us to organize all necessary

492
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:29,390
measures to to do so which means to help

493
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,809
us to find a place to participate on

494
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:38,090
funding to to help with the program and

495
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:41,178
so on so it's not only during parallel

496
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:44,928
police as a service but we we want to

497
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:48,799
hat primarily to to towns and cities and

498
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:52,880
places where already is some at least

499
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:56,539
bunch of people that is interested in

500
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,960
whatever digital freedom crypto whatever

501
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:03,559
and or any aspect of Paris and would

502
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:07,970
like to have a trial version of parallel

503
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:15,799
police in their place so we plan to have

504
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:17,510
like some like week till month stops in

505
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:21,320
different places and we hope that next

506
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:25,100
year we will cover a couple of cities

507
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:28,428
and places in Europe and then there are

508
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:31,490
lots of very wild plans where I was the

509
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:35,090
truck can go but it's it's a question of

510
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:39,049
future development next significant

511
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:42,678
project that has been launched not not

512
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:49,340
so long ago is media hub or Media Lab

513
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:53,240
story that is underground under Bitcoin

514
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:57,799
coffee in Peru police were previously 3d

515
00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:02,629
printing lab was and Media Lab is now

516
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:05,840
exists of streaming streaming place

517
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:11,178
where you can come and stream with a

518
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:15,230
professional equipment like like

519
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:18,169
immediately almost so so it it should

520
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:22,340
enable to create more and more video

521
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:25,970
content and podcast and so on and then

522
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:29,299
there is a small working place where we

523
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:33,009
would like to attract journalists to

524
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:36,499
come and work and we are gonna offer

525
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:39,350
some temporary programs like couple of

526
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:42,019
months of let's say internship or

527
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:46,399
training connected with a practical work

528
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:49,279
in in technical and a little bit more

529
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,758
sophisticated and complicated topics we

530
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:57,109
are talking about because we feel that

531
00:29:51,759 --> 00:30:00,230
media coverage of topics we deal with in

532
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:04,100
pearl palace is still quite poor and and

533
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:07,369
not not educated so we would like to

534
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:10,488
improve it and to give journalists ways

535
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:13,309
how how to refer about it better and of

536
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:15,950
course the security of journalists and

537
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:19,730
their independence as well big topic

538
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:22,909
worldwide as well so it's it's also some

539
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:26,299
some direction Media Lab would like to

540
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:30,109
work for this purpose we've joined with

541
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:34,850
a fund for independent independence of

542
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:40,279
journalists so they helped us to define

543
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:43,850
what really interests journalist next

544
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:49,489
next place we've recently opened is

545
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:54,049
newly newly gained places right right in

546
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:55,820
the next building beside propolis we've

547
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:59,980
received the keys a couple of days ago

548
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:03,529
and the purpose of this place will be

549
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:06,590
extension of our our co-working place

550
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:09,169
but it will work on a little bit

551
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:11,590
different principles we call it for now

552
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:15,999
a curated co-working which means that

553
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:19,330
we will select projects that will be

554
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:22,620
present in in this co-working and those

555
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:26,949
projects will be should be more

556
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:29,649
project-based more more related to the

557
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:32,580
core topics of parallel Poly's which

558
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:36,100
means crypto technologies anonymization

559
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:39,699
privacy decentralization and so and so

560
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:43,658
on so we will try to create a more

561
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:46,119
exclusive place and hopefully one day it

562
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:47,619
will develop into some incubator or

563
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:51,610
something like this for for crypto

564
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:54,100
projects on this we test a cooperation

565
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,619
with one of our sponsors the Rockaway

566
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,469
blockchain so we will see how far this

567
00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:04,959
cooperation will will go and maybe how

568
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:06,940
far this project will continue I would

569
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,330
like to mention that imperil Paulo is

570
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:13,179
the basic way we start project is not

571
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,949
that we completely plan everything how

572
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:17,470
it will be in one year two years three

573
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:20,259
years to have a budget and everything

574
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,389
because usually when we when we start

575
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:25,059
any project like this for example

576
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:27,248
incubator and we meet people who are

577
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:31,600
professionals in doing incubators they

578
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:34,450
trust also you need two thousand two

579
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,559
hundred two thousand euros to start you

580
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:41,919
need this panel of advisors etc etc so

581
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:45,908
it's for us it would be completely not

582
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:49,379
doable so we start we try to start from

583
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:52,570
from scratch with one pilot project and

584
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:55,178
and see if we will succeed in a little

585
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,840
bit different way then then as usual so

586
00:32:55,179 --> 00:33:02,860
the whole policy is based on this

587
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:06,668
attitude in terms of community life I

588
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:09,969
would say the same Eric told about

589
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:11,529
secret Bitcoin meetups the same problem

590
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:14,799
we were solving here that the common

591
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:18,399
public Bitcoin meetups were sometimes

592
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,918
too overcrowded by speculums or

593
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:23,379
journalists or people who simply don't

594
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,750
care about the basic values and

595
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:29,260
in principles of parabolas and are just

596
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:31,210
going to learn how to get rich so we've

597
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,420
established a Club of parallel polish

598
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:36,340
which is more exclusive there is some

599
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,770
there are some principles how to gain

600
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:42,129
trust among the people so only people

601
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:46,960
who are approved can can enter this club

602
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:50,050
and it's got its own program now it have

603
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:54,130
its own leader who creates creates all

604
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:56,740
program and and manages what what the

605
00:33:54,130 --> 00:34:03,250
members need and want and I think it

606
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:05,080
this works very well at the at the end I

607
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:10,260
would like only to me mention that

608
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:13,179
recently we as a community leave some

609
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,340
idealistic vision of leadership of our

610
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:19,029
core organization based on total

611
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:22,950
decentralized principle without any

612
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:26,850
leader and manager just self managing

613
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:31,589
community which was repeatedly failing

614
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:34,870
during last five years we've opened so

615
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:37,780
so so now we try to learn how to

616
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:41,440
establish some fair and transparent

617
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:44,950
leadership that will be able to deal

618
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:48,130
with a increasing amount of people who

619
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:49,810
are paid for their work in in perl post

620
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:52,990
which is almost ten people now it's

621
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:56,380
quite a lot so we are like a

622
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:58,330
professional firm or we we should be to

623
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:01,380
be able to do these bank projects like

624
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:04,120
this on track and so on so we we try to

625
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:08,740
professionalize a little bit how how the

626
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:11,230
core organization work and we also deal

627
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:14,529
a lot with new ways of communication the

628
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:18,430
Media Lab is one of examples focused at

629
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:22,990
the audio and video content but we also

630
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:25,680
have lots of headaches with Facebook so

631
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:30,189
we try to search for other other

632
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:32,049
alternatives which are not so we we at

633
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,849
least switch more and more to Twitter

634
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,339
and

635
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:40,200
explore possibilities to use for example

636
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:43,509
telegram channels as in some ways to to

637
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:47,740
communicate with with wider communities

638
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:51,760
without necessity to to be completely on

639
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:54,129
Facebook which I totally hate but but I

640
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,079
I know that it's the most effective way

641
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:58,839
to communicate and if you want to

642
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,730
educate you need to communicate with as

643
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:05,799
white public as possible

644
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:08,559
and the last thing I leave up to

645
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:16,630
following discussion so thank you that's

646
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:20,050
that's what is new thank you thank a lot

647
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:23,619
Martin and now we have representatives

648
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:25,329
from parallel police Barcelona Oh police

649
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:29,290
but Adela exactly

650
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:33,819
that's Alana Nelson so it's your turn oh

651
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:36,460
no I don't have a slice so so yeah I'm

652
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:38,980
Nelson marina I live in Barcelona I came

653
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,750
here to a weapon and police power so I

654
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:45,220
guess we got the new kids on the block

655
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:46,930
we still in gestation not open yet one

656
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,569
of our co-founders still they are

657
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:54,160
literally digging a hole and building

658
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:57,190
stairs in the building so what we were

659
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,500
trying to do is first get the project

660
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:05,650
started with polytechnics academy

661
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:08,140
project by by amia bio miyazaki and out

662
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:11,140
came to be in bath realized as he met

663
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:13,359
this disco founder found the space and

664
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,910
wanted to do it there and then the other

665
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,578
question what what to do else and that's

666
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:22,210
how we got connected to to aversion and

667
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:28,660

669
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:35,500
of trying to make the perfect plan and

670
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:37,809
having the perfect model we understood

671
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:42,910
that the best way to do it is just go

672
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:46,690
step by step and simply open so the

673
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:47,170

the mass okay I just prepared some

720
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:33,770
presentation slides about the evolution

721
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:37,190
of a sheet set by the way PP ki ke is

722
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:38,870
just a short so like snow what does it

723
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,870
mean like peepees for para la police and

724
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:45,410
he caiis just work oh say so you

725
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:49,160
know what does that PB ki I mean so I

726
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:51,200
got some some I would call it a road map

727
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,710
or our history here what we went through

728
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,720
so basically I got it called in the

729
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,360
chapters the first one will be on

730
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,029
shoulders of giants I call it it's the

731
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,820
way how we begin to function and

732
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:08,170
basically the whole idea of getting

733
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:12,320
poorer Nepal is because she said going

734
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:14,060
emerged in the HCP p17 Congress that's

735
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,430
when we were first time here and we

736
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,410
already they were already free corps

737
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:20,330
members who we were doing some stuff for

738
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,149
the community like running nodes and

739
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:25,100
things like that but we wanted to do

740
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:27,560
something more and we didn't know really

741
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,569
what to do and if the Congress we

742
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:32,360
learned and we knew okay so we would

743
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:34,520
like to create something like this but

744
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,320
first it wasn't really we were not

745
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,300
thinking about creating our own police

746
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,480
because then we found out that they are

747
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,910
working on partner police but you saw so

748
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,760
I wrote you Ryan email that hey I heard

749
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:48,649
about for Nepal is bachi Sawa it's Club

750
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:53,390
project would like to help and he's like

751
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:56,600
don't help us do your own so that's how

752
00:41:53,390 --> 00:42:01,460
we got to put on a police bratislava in

753
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:04,779
January 2018 and you I just created a

754
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,830
wonderful day for us full of

755
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,500
brainstorming and meeting people from

756
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,580
from partner police and innocent

757
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,690
institutions to lucky

758
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:16,819
think-tank and we just gathered a huge

759
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:19,430
amount of motivation and ideas and

760
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:23,150
basically that that what really started

761
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:24,830
creating the whole thing and then the

762
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,350
next step I would call baby starts when

763
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:29,990
we really started like thinking it can

764
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,400
be done and it's a huge help of course

765
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,169
came from Tirana police but he saw

766
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,110
because they had the members they had

767
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,760
Facebook they had the webpage up they

768
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,290
had newsletters and things like that so

769
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,360
that's where they announce perón a

770
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,850
police car she'd say and that's how we

771
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,500
started meeting people and then those

772
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:47,420
people were like okay this is a

773
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,520
decentralized project so why don't we

774
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,290
have our own stuff our own webpage and

775
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,050
things like that and one of the first

776
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:56,450
guys that contacted us Roman is a web

777
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:58,490
developer and we really like people that

778
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,740
are I call them makers of builders and

779
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:02,120
they're not asking you what they should

780
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,770
do but they're saying like oh hey I

781
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,560
think you need a webpage how about I

782
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:09,650
created for you like okay yeah yeah do

783
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,390
it please so so basically this web page

784
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,730
and all the Instagram channels and

785
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,450
things like that Twitter you can find it

786
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,760
on the web page

787
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,830
those came along during that discussion

788
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:22,070
with those new people that they wanted

789
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:27,560
to create something then we were

790
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:30,410
thinking how to somehow the idea out to

791
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:33,049
the public or at least try to advertise

792
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:34,009
it to the people that's the phase that I

793
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:37,850
call the garrulous

794
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:40,190
it's it was done in from from June last

795
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:42,529
year and basically what we did we were

796
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:45,500
we were doing some we call it a guerilla

797
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:47,660
marketing we were doing some signs and

798
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:51,050
putting them all over course it's a with

799
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:53,000
it's some funny messages like bitcoin is

800
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:55,190
dead bitcoin is a bubble and things like

801
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,970
that so you can see that like the

802
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:01,220
preparation stop here like these are the

803
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:04,370
signs there were QR codes that led you

804
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:08,959
to a webpage which says bitcoin is lad

805
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:12,400
this is Bitcoin is a bubble so like then

806
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,980
this one is a Bitcoin is a scam a

807
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,020
Bitcoin is a bubble again and Bitcoin is

808
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,550
dad right and it's it's it's all over

809
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,950
the place in cash it's an interesting

810
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:24,340
thing was that people started really

811
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,970
asking other people that hey guys do

812
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:29,980
who is responsible for this people are

813
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:32,709
saying and things like that like is

814
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:34,240
it a scale what's this about so we

815
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,860
started doing like this guerilla

816
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:42,009
marketing and it has an interesting

817
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:44,230
impact then we decided to do some some

818
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:46,540
open bizarre things and you're like ok

819
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:48,400
you should open up in Bazaar but we

820
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,370
should be selling something right what

821
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,110
to sell so the first thing okay we've

822
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,970
got t-shirts that's fine and then

823
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:59,260
something may be useful so that's how

824
00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:01,149
one of our members he's out oh this is

825
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,270
how one of our members decided oh let's

826
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,160
do a seed word like a place where you

827
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:08,470
can put the seed words nicely it has the

828
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,450
pro Nepalese logo and you can use it and

829
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:12,839
it's something that that that's useful

830
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:14,950
right you can use the mnemonic seed and

831
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,140
basically this is open sourced you can

832
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:21,189
find how to print 3d printed on our

833
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:25,180
github this was done as well by Roman

834
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:27,940
and some other guys around the foreigner

835
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,279
police group and it just came out of

836
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,780
like after the community it was

837
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,350
something that was ordered just like hey

838
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,350
let's do this

839
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:38,320
then we were thinking that okay now

840
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:41,169
maybe people know about us but they

841
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,280
never met us right so so and we don't

842
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:45,220
have a building yeah I think oh

843
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:50,920
sigh so we needed a place to meet and

844
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:52,540
then one of one of the institutions how

845
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,750
you want to call it it's called Kino

846
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,759
smart they decided while we were talking

847
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:01,030
to them like hey at how about we create

848
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,770
some meetup or some grand opening for

849
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:06,190
Perrin a police car she says so people

850
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:09,130
know you don't know us and and can we do

851
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,840
some payments so don't you have see what

852
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,670
we wanted to have all payments in crypto

853
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:15,550
things like that it's like okay sure you

854
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:19,180
can do it so that's like a meet over me

855
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:21,910
and now spawn a place oh the ATM

856
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,140
and things like that and that's when we

857
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,490
basically revealed that the guerrilla

858
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,650
marketing it's something that we were

859
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:28,540
doing and if you were doing the

860
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,370
guerrilla marketing different QR codes

861
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,880
we're sending you to different places in

862
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,799
the city

863
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,480
and once you've finished it you went to

864
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,109
the pond a police webpage so that's what

865
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,239
I the guide and don't

866
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:44,109
basically these are the steps that we

867
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:46,659
are we've done and the next basically

868
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:48,399
slide talks about the future so we

869
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:51,069
realized that we shouldn't have like

870
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:52,479
huge goals that we cannot meet so we

871
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:56,229
should have smaller goals that are

872
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:58,598
doable and well the first thing was that

873
00:46:56,229 --> 00:47:00,428
we already met this year that there were

874
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:02,229
three of us at the beginning so we

875
00:47:00,429 --> 00:47:04,479
wanted to double the core team so it's

876
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:07,899
it's more than double like seven or

877
00:47:04,479 --> 00:47:10,178
eight guys to help us then we decided

878
00:47:07,899 --> 00:47:12,368
that okay so so now it's may be the time

879
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:13,989
to go out and start creating content

880
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:16,749
regularly like blog posts and podcasts

881
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:19,959
we're already working on it but we tried

882
00:47:16,749 --> 00:47:21,729
it before and it doesn't work in a way

883
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:23,859
that you start doing it and then you

884
00:47:21,729 --> 00:47:25,689
stop right so we have to prepare it in

885
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:27,848
front and to create some buffers alright

886
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:29,519
now we working on that and of course the

887
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:31,509
building now is a time when we are

888
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,339
negotiating in some people about the

889
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:34,989
building because now we really feel that

890
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:39,159
it should be done and it's it's needed

891
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:40,839
it wasn't needed till now so that's the

892
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:42,549
goals and basically the lessons learned

893
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:45,099
are the same I think there's four other

894
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:46,989
guys that yeah we don't want to we don't

895
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:51,519
want to be there for every single person

896
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:53,619
on this planet and we we need to let

897
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:55,959
people to come us to come to us and to

898
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:57,549
maybe show the lights show show

899
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:59,558
ourselves in the communities but it's

900
00:47:57,549 --> 00:48:04,809
like high chance to find people that are

901
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:06,819
of the same blood type so and of course

902
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:08,289
make it fun not a living so do not try

903
00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:11,769
to profit from it or whatever it's all

904
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:14,169
not for them okay thanks and if you want

905
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:17,428
to see our web page you can see you

906
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:17,429
there or write us any more

907
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:27,920
so make a lot guys for present in your

908
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:32,270
communities

909
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,849
now it's question time and I'm going I

910
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:37,339
prepared some question and I try to be

911
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:38,780
first so you will ask one question I'm

912
00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:44,000
going to ask one question you are we are

913
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:56,020
going to ask okay okay yeah so the

914
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:58,849
question microphone I'm not sure I like

915
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:01,579
who is the question is the third but I

916
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:03,980
guess to all of you so I have two

917
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:06,980
questions one is how you decide which

918
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:10,700
member to get in and which member not to

919
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:15,049
get in like and the second is how the

920
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:17,240
membership model a work is it like we

921
00:49:15,049 --> 00:49:18,710
walk where there is a couple of like

922
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,549
people together a group out in

923
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:37,160
individuals that are just renting the

924
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:43,460
space for a day and so the the decision

925
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:57,680
on who can become a member is a decision

926
00:49:43,460 --> 00:50:00,190
of the community so yeah and everybody

927
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,190
else move

928
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:06,029
maybe this cure will be just for us I

929
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:24,700
want to go to the data talk as well you

930
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:43,259
can leave us a virtual smuggler free

931
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:43,259
Bitcoin yes it gets Markos

932
00:50:49,069 --> 00:50:59,190
all right looks like the mainstream is

933
00:50:51,900 --> 00:51:04,319
over so how how do we decide on members

934
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:06,569
so everyone has a veto right so if

935
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,609
anyone in the community thinks someone

936
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:11,390
is not a good fit they're not getting in

937
00:51:08,609 --> 00:51:17,609
no matter how many other people like

938
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:21,328
them we try to make this decision very

939
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:24,749
carefully we do not try to maximize the

940
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:28,890
number of members currently so that

941
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:31,470
means that we like to tell people to

942
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:33,749
become volunteers first kind of get to

943
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:41,368
know us we should get to know them and

944
00:51:33,749 --> 00:51:44,519
it's it's not only about growth so so by

945
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:47,009
the fact that it's something that takes

946
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:49,738
out of our time we like to spend it with

947
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:54,859
people we like and we interact with and

948
00:51:49,739 --> 00:52:09,930
it's basically as York said that the

949
00:51:54,859 --> 00:52:12,450
good people stay and it it has been

950
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:16,609
quite positive experience doing it this

951
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:21,538
way so what what I wanted to tell you

952
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:24,450
before everyone left was and then I will

953
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:27,210
answer the second question is that when

954
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:31,169
we started this in prac and also in

955
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:33,869
Bratislava everyone told us that we are

956
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:37,049
crazy you know doing something only on

957
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:38,940
Bitcoin it cannot work and so on so for

958
00:52:37,049 --> 00:52:42,150
us it's like telling us the sky is blue

959
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:45,259
we already knew that we are crazy but

960
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:48,359
what is so so right now you're

961
00:52:45,259 --> 00:52:50,910
experiencing survivorship bias because

962
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:53,730
you are listening to people that made it

963
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:56,999
and there are a lot of people who were

964
00:52:53,730 --> 00:53:00,390
crazy and they were not able to pull it

965
00:52:56,999 --> 00:53:02,308
off the community didn't work so so the

966
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:06,720
community the people

967
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:09,359
who built the space or the clipped

968
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,160
crypto liberation community they're

969
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,348
really generated by the community in

970
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:17,098
these places it's not like you cannot

971
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:21,569
rent a building and make it work without

972
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:24,089
people so so this is the most important

973
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:26,788
aspect and even when I'm speaking to

974
00:53:24,089 --> 00:53:29,940
people who want to start well police and

975
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:32,130
they start looking for a building I ask

976
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,200
them okay so how many members of the

977
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:37,289
community there are and if they say

978
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:39,868
three then I say don't look for a

979
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:42,210
building look for the community first

980
00:53:39,869 --> 00:53:46,619
and then you can together figure out if

981
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:49,230
you get a container or or a bar or you

982
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:52,980
meet somewhere else or it's enough to

983
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:56,730
build your own come or built in your own

984
00:53:52,980 --> 00:54:00,230
space or rented space so this is very

985
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:04,049
important and I'm very happy to say that

986
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:06,359
my view is much nicer than yours right

987
00:54:04,049 --> 00:54:10,230
now because you guys had to look at us

988
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:15,029
but we all see a lot of crazy people

989
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:16,799
that come to these conferences and that

990
00:54:15,029 --> 00:54:19,680
the reason that this all works is

991
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:21,630
because there are enough people like you

992
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,089
that care about it that care about

993
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:27,420
freedom and care about creating these

994
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:30,259
communities so so I think that's the

995
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:33,599
most important thing and people should

996
00:54:30,259 --> 00:54:38,640
take their time in curating the

997
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:41,609
communities you know it's not even one

998
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,640
community per city in Berlin you have to

999
00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:47,400
and in Bratislava we have a progress bar

1000
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,410
hackerspace as well so if someone is not

1001
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,250
a good fit for us they can go to the

1002
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:56,430
other place oh so it's not about I don't

1003
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:58,349
perceive excluding someone not accepting

1004
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:00,419
them as a member of a community as a bad

1005
00:54:58,349 --> 00:55:04,890
thing I think it's important that

1006
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:07,980
everyone finds the the group of people

1007
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:10,710
that they like doing and and enjoy to

1008
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:14,720
interact with so was the answer to the

1009
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,720
first question what was the second

1010
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:28,770
all so in parallel Nepalese Bratislava

1011
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:30,990
is only individual so also board members

1012
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,880
who are entrepreneurs who pay a little

1013
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:37,589
bit more membership fees they're

1014
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:41,400
individuals so we don't accept companies

1015
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:43,710
as members we do not refuse sponsorship

1016
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:49,530
so even this conference is sponsored by

1017
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:50,160
a few companies but still it is curated

1018
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:54,089
a lot

1019
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:58,319
so most of crypto conferences have you

1020
00:55:54,089 --> 00:56:01,950
know 12 general sponsors and 27

1021
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:07,440
you know silver sponsors and so on we

1022
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:12,180
try to try to work with fewer companies

1023
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:16,470
if we can and make sure that these are

1024
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:20,580
people who we can stand behind but as

1025
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:23,310
for core membership that pay monthly

1026
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:27,630
membership fees and get involved in

1027
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:30,900
day-to-day operation of parallel police

1028
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:34,230
it's only individual members maybe maybe

1029
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:36,180
other communities may use the different

1030
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:38,339
models so and maybe I should just add

1031
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:43,020
that especially in parallel post pro in

1032
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:45,210
Bratislava we do quite strict background

1033
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:47,339
checking of members especially like

1034
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:51,390
board members so for example these

1035
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:52,770
people cannot be politician in all so

1036
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:56,730
these people cannot be related to

1037
00:56:52,770 --> 00:57:00,270
politics in some way cannot be corrupted

1038
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:04,200
for example and and but when we know

1039
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:05,490
these people and we we are also willing

1040
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,460
to accept their privacy

1041
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:13,049
so these donors may be alone emails if

1042
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:15,960
they want okay so any answers these

1043
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:18,150
questions yeah from my side I think it's

1044
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:22,330
very important to come together in areas

1045
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:23,890
like this but we also try to reach

1046
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:25,690
people who does not have this

1047
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:27,580
understanding yet

1048
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:30,160
and that's why I think it's important to

1049
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:32,560
make this barriers not too high to get

1050
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,009
new people in to educate them about

1051
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:40,110
these systems and that's why by at our

1052
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:42,790
meter everybody is working so yeah yeah

1053
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:45,070
yeah I think what you're saying about

1054
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:47,080
that you can do it do it only if you

1055
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:49,540
have the community already so maybe the

1056
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,400
question could be like what you do if

1057
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:54,730
you have a community already with like

1058
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,830
the core of it working then you do a

1059
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:58,630
different selection for people right but

1060
00:57:56,830 --> 00:58:01,779
if you are building the core itself it's

1061
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:04,300
much harder and what we do in because it

1062
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:06,460
says that we let those people come with

1063
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:08,230
us and and usually at the beginning that

1064
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,470
is just work and you get nothing for it

1065
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:13,870
right and so you automatically lose like

1066
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:16,109
99.999% of people hate to spoil it too

1067
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:19,029
but it's the same after five years it's

1068
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:21,760
I think that's a good filter anyway that

1069
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:23,800
you let people do something and and the

1070
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,600
same way right somebody cannot become a

1071
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,610
board member just because you know him

1072
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,680
like one day I had to go through the

1073
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:31,600
steps like do everything and get

1074
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:35,169
reputation and work on things and after

1075
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:39,509
that you they can be one one one more

1076
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:43,420
thing an important distinction is that

1077
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:46,870
this doesn't apply to our let's say

1078
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:48,970
customers so like we don't filter who

1079
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:53,279
can come and drink coffee in Bitcoin

1080
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:57,069
coffee we don't screen who is going to

1081
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,290
to the tolk at the Institute or to a

1082
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:02,560
conference any one of you we don't know

1083
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:06,580
you personally every every and each one

1084
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:09,490
of you so so we are very open so there

1085
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:11,529
is kind of an internal site which

1086
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:13,839
consists of the community but there is

1087
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:16,870
also an external site where we kind of

1088
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:18,220
serve everyone it's also different in

1089
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:22,180
different communities probably the

1090
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:26,259
container has a different model but that

1091
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:29,529
doesn't mean either that everyone should

1092
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:33,490
be our customers so what I like to say

1093
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:35,920
is that for example by our crazy

1094
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:38,379
limitation that we only accept crypt

1095
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,300
we are meeting them halfway because this

1096
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,730
is a filter you know if half of the

1097
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:45,040
people they realize that they have to

1098
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:48,220
you know install a walid and buy some

1099
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:50,830
weird money and just in order to get

1100
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:53,410
coffee they turn around and they leave

1101
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:55,720
and it's perfectly fine for for us we

1102
00:59:53,410 --> 01:00:00,310
would like to teach them how to how to

1103
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:02,470
do it with crypto but I think this

1104
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:05,830
filter is very useful because what it

1105
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:08,470
filters is for openness so if someone

1106
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:10,660
has ten minutes to you know go through

1107
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:13,419
the crypto torture and learn something

1108
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:16,770
new we at least know they're open to new

1109
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:19,360
experiences and if they pass this test

1110
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:23,440
they become our customer but if they

1111
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:27,100
don't we not necessarily want them so so

1112
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:29,980
we are not a company for-profit company

1113
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:33,970
so we're not maximizing you know income

1114
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:37,540
from selling coffee we are trying to to

1115
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:41,379
kind of give this option of attaining

1116
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:44,170
more freedom but they need to signal to

1117
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:48,970
us that they're willing to at least have

1118
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:51,760
their head open and and kind of give it

1119
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:54,430
a shot so they need the there is an

1120
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,520
investment on the side of our customers

1121
01:00:54,430 --> 01:01:00,669
that we require of them and one of the

1122
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:03,280
investments is that they are open to

1123
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:06,760
this crypto experience but there are

1124
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:10,660
many other things so for a stranger

1125
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:15,400
entering parallel police even here in

1126
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:18,450
Prague the experience at the beginning

1127
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:22,420
is not easy you know even if you go to

1128
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:25,270
room 77 definitely to crypto container

1129
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:26,830
you enter a space that is not common

1130
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:29,710
it's not you know it's not it's not

1131
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:33,040
McDonald's it's not you know I want this

1132
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:36,430
and then then you get it and it it makes

1133
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:38,860
people uneasy it's at the beginning not

1134
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:40,629
a pleasant experience but I think that

1135
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:44,080
this is a feature because it's a it's a

1136
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:48,000
good filter about who you will get as

1137
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,000
the people who visit the space

1138
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:56,560
is it working yeah but quite obviously

1139
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:58,690
there's representatives of really very

1140
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,310
different kinds of organizations sitting

1141
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:02,950
here on this panel we have communities

1142
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:06,009
that were built on purpose we have

1143
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:08,049
communities that happened these

1144
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:10,859
communities have obviously entirely

1145
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:10,859
different goals

1146
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:16,329
so yeah room 77 for example of course

1147
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:18,490
beer a bar everybody can come in

1148
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:21,730
everybody's welcome I hope everybody

1149
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:24,129
feels comfortable when they come in but

1150
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:27,849
I have I am so we are not vetting

1151
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:32,550
anybody or or choosing our customers but

1152
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:35,500
I do still have one thing to say about

1153
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:38,320
yeah how to choose the members of your

1154
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:40,890
of your community um I think did this

1155
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:43,450
little game before do me a favor

1156
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:46,359
everybody in the audience just for a

1157
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:49,118
second look into the face of somebody

1158
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:52,020
else in the audience do me a favor just

1159
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:57,069
do it now just look into somebody's face

1160
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:59,950
right I estimate there's about a hundred

1161
01:02:57,069 --> 01:03:04,329
people in this room and I guarantee you

1162
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:09,180
that two to five of you just looked into

1163
01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:09,180
the face of an undercover government spy

1164
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:14,920
you may think this is you might think

1165
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:19,540
this is paranoid I come from Germany I

1166
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:22,589
can speak for Germany no forget Stasi we

1167
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:27,430
are much better these days come on

1168
01:03:22,589 --> 01:03:29,950
Germany Germany is in Germany we know

1169
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:34,290
that the government is literally

1170
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:37,020
infiltrating every however innocent

1171
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:39,359
organization it came out they they

1172
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:42,130
infiltrated a student group

1173
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:46,750
demonstrating against animal testing of

1174
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:50,190
cosmetic products we have we have

1175
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:53,380
undercover cops in every political

1176
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:59,950
organization and for absolutely sure in

1177
01:03:53,380 --> 01:04:01,990
every crypto organization and I'm saying

1178
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:05,560
this because I have an advice

1179
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:07,720
if you whatever kind of community in

1180
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:12,790
this area you built around Bitcoin

1181
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:17,950
crypto freedom liberty whatever you have

1182
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:21,220
to expect government spies come and

1183
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:24,250
infiltrate you and the best way to spot

1184
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:27,490
them is they are usually the really

1185
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:32,310
radical guys who's a jest to do criminal

1186
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:32,310
stuff this is this is also not kidding

1187
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:39,609
the-the-the the majority of people still

1188
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:41,619
looks at bitcoiners and crypto

1189
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:44,020
enthusiasts and anarchists and whatever

1190
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:48,000
they call himself you know who not sure

1191
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:53,970
are they evil or are they not evil the

1192
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,240
state apparatus wants us to look evil of

1193
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:58,598
course

1194
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:00,759
they send people in who radicalize us so

1195
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:03,640
if you if you form any kind of community

1196
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:06,070
around these topics and you have a new

1197
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:08,470
very enthusiastic member who keep

1198
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:11,200
suggesting that we should hack the banks

1199
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:13,359
to show how insecure they are or that we

1200
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,700
should distribute these stolen credit

1201
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:18,369
card numbers to show how insecure

1202
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:20,259
MasterCard is you have quite a good

1203
01:05:18,369 --> 01:05:22,810
chance that you spotted the government

1204
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:25,960
spy already I just thought I'd throw

1205
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:29,670
that in or they binge watched mr. robot

1206
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:35,380
or they binge watched me mr. robot for

1207
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:38,800
for the past weekend okay so now it's my

1208
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:42,720
turn I'm going to ask a question what

1209
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:46,540
was initial stimulus like initial reason

1210
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:49,419
you just said let's do it and

1211
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:52,420
you created your community what was the

1212
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:58,119
stimulus the initial stimulus if you did

1213
01:05:52,420 --> 01:06:00,010
it so from outside we just thought it's

1214
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:02,560
not everything is happening in Berlin

1215
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:04,000
and we looked around in the west of

1216
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:07,150
Germany and there was nearly nothing

1217
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,520
just one small meetup in Cologne it's

1218
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:12,280
years ago now it was one of the first in

1219
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:13,930
West Germany and that's why we decided

1220
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:17,440
to yeah

1221
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:20,618
bring our area closer to this

1222
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:24,789
cryptocurrency and yeah that's the main

1223
01:06:20,619 --> 01:06:27,579
reason and also our co-founder the Linux

1224
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:31,000
hotel is running education since 15

1225
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:34,359
years now they are also interested in

1226
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,579
this field cryptocurrencies that's why

1227
01:06:34,359 --> 01:06:40,420
we decided to run this concept of

1228
01:06:36,579 --> 01:06:42,849
seminal works reporter yeah yeah

1229
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:44,410
first it was a mix of different things

1230
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:46,720
so there was the Polytechnic secondary

1231
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:49,420
project but also when I came back from

1232
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:52,450
London to to Barcelona I realized that

1233
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:54,849
there was like a lot of developers a lot

1234
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:57,759
of blockchain companies present but

1235
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:59,470
there was no they were not connected it

1236
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:04,270
was very very decentralized a little bit

1237
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:06,490
too much so the I fought having one spot

1238
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:08,559
one central spot where everyone connects

1239
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:10,149
everyone collaborate everyone meet each

1240
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:12,250
other everyone knows what's what's

1241
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:13,960
happening then you can from there you

1242
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:17,200
can have project me or you can have more

1243
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:20,440
coherence so that's that's the one of

1244
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:22,808
the main drive yeah and by the way I

1245
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,630
think it's cool to hang out and online

1246
01:07:22,809 --> 01:07:27,250
chats or forums and blocks but you

1247
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:29,410
definitely need a place where you can

1248
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:33,460
get in touch on an eye an eye level and

1249
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:36,058
yeah it's very important I think I

1250
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:38,890
already told the whole story but I like

1251
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:41,260
saying that the forums are nice but the

1252
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:43,509
real other filter is to me the person in

1253
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:46,710
person because body language can tell

1254
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:49,210
you a lot so if you find that person

1255
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:52,150
that something's weird about that person

1256
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:54,819
then it's probably like that that's my

1257
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:56,920
like that's most of the time it's maybe

1258
01:07:54,819 --> 01:07:58,390
because the I under the ideology or the

1259
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,349
way of thinking of the person is

1260
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:04,450
different than yours

1261
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:07,660
so it's another and in case of propolis

1262
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:10,089
practiced quite notorious but you and

1263
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:12,069
your I came and told us you get to cool

1264
01:08:10,089 --> 01:08:14,619
hackers place in Bratislava called

1265
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:17,198
progress bar you guys should have

1266
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:20,679
something similar in track they're just

1267
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:23,778
like this hardcore hardware hacker space

1268
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:27,019
but but not that coolest

1269
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:31,880
progress bar is this is okay this google

1270
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:33,949
are inspiring like respect and we know

1271
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:36,440
almost about what they are saying

1272
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:39,678
so we should manage a place where you'll

1273
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:43,928
gather a smart guys is these are and

1274
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:46,868
they will tell us everything but one

1275
01:08:43,929 --> 01:08:49,779
important point was when we really

1276
01:08:46,868 --> 01:08:52,549
attended hacker space and we saw how

1277
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:55,909
exclusive place it isn't mean in terms

1278
01:08:52,549 --> 01:09:00,589
of it is hardly achievable for people

1279
01:08:55,908 --> 01:09:02,868
from outside and when we found this

1280
01:09:00,589 --> 01:09:05,689
house because at the beginning we were

1281
01:09:02,868 --> 01:09:10,939
also searching for some 100 square

1282
01:09:05,689 --> 01:09:14,268
meters x flat that is possible to

1283
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:16,598
finance from some and just small

1284
01:09:14,269 --> 01:09:19,219
membership fees of small group of people

1285
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:21,859
but when he found this house we realized

1286
01:09:19,219 --> 01:09:25,489
that we can totally reverse it make it

1287
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:29,929
totally open make it as much inclusive

1288
01:09:25,488 --> 01:09:32,388
as possible and this was triggered to to

1289
01:09:29,929 --> 01:09:35,690
think differently about the concept of

1290
01:09:32,389 --> 01:09:40,190
hacker space and elaborate this pearl

1291
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:43,549
polish concept yeah for us the progress

1292
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:47,058
was there was a lot of talking for years

1293
01:09:43,549 --> 01:09:49,299
and sooner or later a few of us get fed

1294
01:09:47,059 --> 01:09:53,509
up with talking we just wanted to

1295
01:09:49,299 --> 01:09:57,400
experiment and build and create and so

1296
01:09:53,509 --> 01:10:01,039
it was actually started by by two people

1297
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:04,339
completely funding that themselves by

1298
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:07,849
seeing all their Bitcoin and setting up

1299
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:12,010
the space on their own and whoever liked

1300
01:10:07,849 --> 01:10:17,840
it stuck to it and who didn't didn't

1301
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:21,590
there was our filter as well so for me

1302
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:24,469
personally personal motivation was that

1303
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:28,869
I was envious that Prague had pearl

1304
01:10:24,469 --> 01:10:31,969
police that I kind of helped to build so

1305
01:10:28,869 --> 01:10:34,249
so progress bar was an inspiration for

1306
01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:37,860
pearl police in Prague but then I

1307
01:10:34,249 --> 01:10:40,780
realized that I don't want progress but

1308
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:43,630
police in bratislava as well so it was

1309
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:46,509
the same motivation inverted so because

1310
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:48,970
every time when I arrived to Prague to

1311
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:51,670
me prac doesn't exist it's a totally

1312
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:54,700
boring city the only thing that I do I

1313
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:56,140
get out of the Train I get two parallel

1314
01:10:54,700 --> 01:11:00,250
police and then I spend all the time

1315
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:03,730
here so so I wanted that you know I

1316
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:07,450
wanted to cut short the train ride to

1317
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:09,429
Prague and to kind of make this

1318
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:11,860
experience walking distance from my

1319
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:13,930
apartment so there was a personal

1320
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:16,240
motivation and other personal motivation

1321
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:18,520
I cannot speak for all our members

1322
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:25,599
because everyone has their own reasons

1323
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:28,330
for for sure but for me I think that if

1324
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:31,510
I didn't do it if I didn't participate

1325
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:35,320
and try to build this crypto ecosystem

1326
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:37,630
now it would be like you know selling

1327
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:40,080
dog food dog food in the 90s you know

1328
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:43,120
the internet revolution was happening

1329
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:45,309
most projects were you know

1330
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:50,559
there was a lot of talk a lot of you

1331
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:52,690
know also Lambos everyone that started

1332
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:55,360
to work for an internet technological

1333
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:58,089
start-up got the keys to a new card and

1334
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:01,509
an apartment so that was this negative

1335
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:04,270
part but still that was when the

1336
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:08,530
internet was really created and when it

1337
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:12,370
really bloomed and if now when this

1338
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:14,980
crypto revolution and using these

1339
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:17,230
technologies for increasing personal

1340
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:21,040
freedom which which is the real reason

1341
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:23,950
why we are doing it if I was I don't

1342
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:29,260
know doing websites

1343
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:31,809
it wouldn't be challenged and I probably

1344
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:35,350
I would be pissed off in ten years that

1345
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:37,480
I did something that was not as

1346
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:39,730
important and as fun even though I know

1347
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:44,469
that most projects will probably fail so

1348
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:45,790
I want to be part of this and why not

1349
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:50,050
start

1350
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:52,720
I don't know next sheet coin or do an

1351
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:57,239
ICO and do a nonprofit which is totally

1352
01:12:52,720 --> 01:13:00,640
crazy is that with parallel police I get

1353
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:03,639
exposed and I help to build the whole

1354
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:06,970
ecosystem so I don't need to invest my

1355
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:11,650
time in this one idea one company but my

1356
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:14,800
goal my personal goal but many people in

1357
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:18,429
peril police share this goal is to

1358
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:21,580
improve the ecosystem so one of the good

1359
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:24,250
outcomes of this project is that we get

1360
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:26,200
these board members they support us but

1361
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,940
I also interact together they create

1362
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:31,360
companies together they create projects

1363
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:33,339
together and we are not in the stage of

1364
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:35,799
competition right now it doesn't matter

1365
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:38,010
who wins you know if there's one company

1366
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:42,700
making ATMs and other company making

1367
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:47,140
ATMs ninety percent of the time they

1368
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:51,070
should cooperate not compete because we

1369
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:53,590
all are invested both monetarily but

1370
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:55,870
also our energies invested in this

1371
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:58,510
crypto community and it doesn't matter

1372
01:13:55,870 --> 01:14:00,580
who wins I don't care if this or that

1373
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:02,410
wallet is the best or this hardware well

1374
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:06,040
it is the best or this cryptocurrency is

1375
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:10,300
the best if any of these projects

1376
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:14,350
actually delivers on this pron on their

1377
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:16,900
promise I'm happy and if I can say that

1378
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:21,280
I was somehow a part of that I'm happy

1379
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:27,849
as well so that's the real reason thank

1380
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:29,050
you now question from the audience so it

1381
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:30,700
seems like your different communities

1382
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:32,470
have these different sort of like

1383
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:35,200
modules that you piece together they're

1384
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:37,780
cafe this debt the other thing one thing

1385
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:40,179
I've been thinking about is how like a

1386
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:43,690
hostel could service like a pretty

1387
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:45,880
strong socialization socialising of

1388
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:48,700
these ideas to sort of normal people as

1389
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:51,130
well as providing services to crypto

1390
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:52,780
travelers so obviously we have the the

1391
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:54,580
crypto hotel who can give us some

1392
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,960
insight some learnings and I'm also

1393
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:59,429
interested in the other communities have

1394
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:01,329
you explore this as one of a potential

1395
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:09,309
expansion of your of your current

1396
01:15:01,329 --> 01:15:12,159
community to be honest I didn't get the

1397
01:15:09,309 --> 01:15:14,849
question in general what what what you

1398
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:17,049
want to know which target audience are

1399
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:19,449
so the question for the communities that

1400
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:21,099
don't do a hostile why not is there a

1401
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:23,409
specific reason have you considered it

1402
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:26,230
and found it not to be a good idea and

1403
01:15:23,409 --> 01:15:28,570
if it's not a good idea why not and that

1404
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:30,610
you running a hotel which is more or

1405
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:34,480
less the same thing as a hostel slightly

1406
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:35,949
less social perhaps you know so do you

1407
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,619
suggest the other communities do that is

1408
01:15:35,949 --> 01:15:40,449
it successful to be honest the hotel

1409
01:15:38,619 --> 01:15:42,070
exists already before the blog shall

1410
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:45,638
tell it's a rebranding so we just

1411
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:49,268
occupied it kind of and it only we

1412
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:51,159
decided to do this because orko fauna is

1413
01:15:49,269 --> 01:15:53,739
the Linux hotel and they are doing this

1414
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:55,570
since 15 years and the hotel was there

1415
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:58,150
and the co-working space was there and

1416
01:15:55,570 --> 01:16:00,190
we kind of rebranded it and brought the

1417
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:02,460
communities to there so that's the main

1418
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:07,000
reason why this is called a hotel so

1419
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:09,880
yeah I guess I guess we I can go on on

1420
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,369
that because so the Academy has an

1421
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:14,349
aspect of co-living so there might be an

1422
01:16:12,369 --> 01:16:17,289
ability of people to stay at the space

1423
01:16:14,349 --> 01:16:19,360
directly if they go through the food for

1424
01:16:17,289 --> 01:16:21,039
the program but also in the neighborhood

1425
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,558
one thing that we thought of doing is

1426
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:26,018
maybe rent one flat or two flats that

1427
01:16:23,559 --> 01:16:28,389
for example if your blockchain company

1428
01:16:26,019 --> 01:16:30,010
like most of us work remotely right you

1429
01:16:28,389 --> 01:16:32,530
you want to meet face to face at some

1430
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:34,719
points and Barcelona is an amazing city

1431
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:36,730
so yeah offer the possibility like you

1432
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:38,440
come for a week you work in the

1433
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:39,699
co-working and then you stay in an

1434
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,960
apartment next to it so that's

1435
01:16:39,699 --> 01:16:43,150
definitely something that we thought

1436
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:46,630
about but it's still very earlier in the

1437
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:48,820
process to know exactly how and how much

1438
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:51,340
and all the details but yeah I think

1439
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:53,619
that's that's a good service to offer it

1440
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:57,519
might be expensive and complicated to do

1441
01:16:53,619 --> 01:17:01,239
but it's definitely a good thing so for

1442
01:16:57,519 --> 01:17:06,010
us we're allowing people to sleep on our

1443
01:17:01,239 --> 01:17:10,879
couch and we're also building a special

1444
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:13,130
container that you can remotely book

1445
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,930
sooner or later that will be ready my

1446
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:16,790
personal dream because I actually agree

1447
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:18,980
with you is to have something like a

1448
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:22,340
capsule hotel in containers that you can

1449
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:24,320
actually move to conferences etc and

1450
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:29,510
actually take the whole environment with

1451
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:32,360
you I forget to mention when I was

1452
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:35,770
telling what's new in peril police

1453
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:40,940
Prague as I told about a new co-working

1454
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:44,180
place there is a 1:1 small room that we

1455
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:47,839
have established as a as a dormitory

1456
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:50,030
with four beds so especially one when

1457
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:52,460
some people from different power

1458
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:56,750
policies or other communities come they

1459
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:59,380
are totally welcome to to use this this

1460
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:02,330
small apartment to stay overnight so

1461
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:03,680
yeah this is our for this Congress we

1462
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:06,559
use it for the first time we are

1463
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:10,100
completing the beds right in the

1464
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:12,590
Thursday afternoon or evening so so it's

1465
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:15,620
also freshly new feature of propolis

1466
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:17,450
here to save money for Airbnb and so on

1467
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:20,510
so you can just contribute to

1468
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:25,960
Perryopolis and stay almost in the house

1469
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:29,390
I think that hotels have a really good

1470
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:34,040
opportunities to to so help people

1471
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:38,750
socialize but what I realized that most

1472
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:41,030
of the socializing happens really in the

1473
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:43,240
hotel bar and in the cafeteria

1474
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:46,700
sometimes you invite people over to

1475
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:49,190
party to your room but most of the

1476
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:53,150
socializing happens in the cafeteria so

1477
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:57,950
it is a very low-cost way to just

1478
01:18:53,150 --> 01:19:01,040
extract what what is the essential part

1479
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:04,639
that builds the community from the whole

1480
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:07,880
hotel concept into into the cafeteria

1481
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,440
itself but of course if people would

1482
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:11,120
like to experiment also with

1483
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:14,750
accommodation I think it's a good idea

1484
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:17,720
and I think people should explore all

1485
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:20,240
the options that are there another thing

1486
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:23,540
that not a lot of people talk about and

1487
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,540
I think it's a great idea is having a

1488
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:28,590
crypto sauna

1489
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:29,580
we would like to do for some people it's

1490
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:32,250
a privacy issue

1491
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:35,160
because mostly people go make it into

1492
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:37,020
the sauna but our will be surveillance

1493
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:39,240
free zone when we when we do it but

1494
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:43,410
that's also a way how people socialize

1495
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:46,620
so I think I think there is nothing

1496
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:49,590
wrong wrong with experimenting with with

1497
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:52,800
these ideas and trying them out what I

1498
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:57,470
would like to ask of anyone of you if

1499
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,470
you do it please share your experience

1500
01:19:57,650 --> 01:20:06,000
Hotel in our crypto hotel in Essen is

1501
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:09,870
not a competition for a crypto hotel in

1502
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,700
Prague so if if we can learn something

1503
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:14,550
from other people's experiences and

1504
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:18,170
apply them then our community can grow

1505
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:21,030
more so so for me there are infinite

1506
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:24,210
number of learning opportunities from

1507
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:26,639
all these other ideas on what what we

1508
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:29,160
can build and what what we can do I

1509
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:33,320
think a hotel or a hostel is a good idea

1510
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:36,030
so nice great idea there are many other

1511
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:38,340
one part of our building is also an

1512
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:40,080
shared economy shared apartment with 8

1513
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:43,050
rooms so you know kitchen and of course

1514
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,460
also sauna so for a hackathon or

1515
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:47,010
something like this you can come there

1516
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:49,380
and spend for example 5 days and nights

1517
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:51,000
together and be productive and we we

1518
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:55,130
also have special conditions then for

1519
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,790
developers for example feel free to join

1520
01:20:55,130 --> 01:21:00,780
ok thank you

1521
01:20:56,790 --> 01:21:04,230
now I have a question so last week I

1522
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:07,590
lost a case and four days in the

1523
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:10,679
Panamanian jungle rainforest in the

1524
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:12,420
community called Cal Ooyala and it's

1525
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:15,320
completely independent community out of

1526
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:18,530
the government a lot of the stay in the

1527
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:20,820
center of jungle they produce their

1528
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:22,800
electricity they have a satellite

1529
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:26,009
internet everything they either they

1530
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:29,430
produce their so they there are almost 1

1531
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:31,170
percent sustainable so this is exactly

1532
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:34,070
my question I'd like to ask you what

1533
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:37,800
about your sustained sustainability so

1534
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:42,299
do you care about it or do you have some

1535
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:45,180
mechanism that in container you you

1536
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:48,780
really care about this topic so do you

1537
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:53,280
care about system sustainability and how

1538
01:21:48,780 --> 01:22:01,980
to survive longer time in the future as

1539
01:21:53,280 --> 01:22:04,190
your as your community or your place I

1540
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:07,530
have just a very brief comment on this

1541
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:10,799
my mind of all our experience in

1542
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:13,800
propolis or oppose is by design

1543
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,780
experimental project and when you want

1544
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,450
to sustain you have to still progress

1545
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:22,920
develop and experiment with new new

1546
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:28,920
things otherwise you will probably die

1547
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:31,440
soon so yeah not to just remain on

1548
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:35,430
something that works and if it's

1549
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:37,830
approved so okay we we just repeat it is

1550
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:40,440
not a good idea and you still have to

1551
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:43,019
progress and test the same is with this

1552
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:45,690
Congress we even though it seems that

1553
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:47,880
everything is perfect and tune then we

1554
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:50,219
can just repeat the same model every

1555
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:53,040
year we inevitably will have to innovate

1556
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:57,450
we will have to search for new ways how

1557
01:22:53,040 --> 01:23:01,760
to create program and so on so I think

1558
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:08,309
that's the challenge for any any

1559
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:11,070
community sitting here so for us the one

1560
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:14,550
of the core tenants of our project is

1561
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:18,389
this ability to move instead of getting

1562
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:22,830
into travel and mobility forces you to

1563
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:26,670
have some preparation so to speak so

1564
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:30,210
number one we have a specific laid away

1565
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:33,720
budget for emergencies that is the

1566
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:37,230
financial sustainability aspect so we

1567
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:40,370
have a contingency budget if you run

1568
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:45,179
into trouble for too long or too much

1569
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:47,519
then we have because when you're when

1570
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:49,440
you plan to be mobile you might end up

1571
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,900
somewhere where infrastructure isn't

1572
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,000
available or not available

1573
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:56,179
yet because it takes time to set up

1574
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:59,870
infrastructure so we're actually trying

1575
01:23:56,180 --> 01:24:04,750
to have like some minimal water vise

1576
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:08,900
water energy communication setup that

1577
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:11,420
allows us to at least exist it's not

1578
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:16,190
comfortable but it allows us to exist

1579
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:19,910
and as soon as we get access to the

1580
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:23,330
infrastructure or scale our own sources

1581
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:27,050
then it becomes comfortable so there's

1582
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:29,300
like this like a backup backup power

1583
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:33,320
system we have that for water we have

1584
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:39,020
for waste water energy communication and

1585
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:42,849
so what I also liked there's a

1586
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:46,610
distinction between sustainability in

1587
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:48,890
order to be a long term project so that

1588
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:50,540
you don't burn your resources other

1589
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:55,490
people mean something else by

1590
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:57,769
sustainability meaning you know you grow

1591
01:24:55,490 --> 01:25:02,510
your own food generate enough

1592
01:24:57,770 --> 01:25:05,630
electricity and so on for us we think

1593
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:08,840
that it's not such a big problem to rely

1594
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:11,180
on outside markets and we kind of would

1595
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:15,470
like to use division of labor these are

1596
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:20,390
good inventions so so for us the more

1597
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:23,300
important part is sustainability of the

1598
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:25,550
project in terms of the community that

1599
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:28,060
we still have people who are actually

1600
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:31,310
interested interested in this project

1601
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:35,660
and also financial sustainability so we

1602
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:39,200
don't you know burn volunteer time and

1603
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:43,790
you know run out of our mental and

1604
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:47,120
physical energy which is we didn't reach

1605
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:50,240
this point yet we rely a lot of a lot on

1606
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:52,370
volunteer work and we need to increase

1607
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:57,980
the level of sustainability in this way

1608
01:25:52,370 --> 01:26:01,760
also though this has other side which

1609
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:04,608
means that if we realize that we are not

1610
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:08,449
sustainable first of all it's our fault

1611
01:26:04,609 --> 01:26:12,769
we don't do something right so we

1612
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:15,678
perceive it as a signal which which

1613
01:26:12,769 --> 01:26:17,859
comes from from the you know from the

1614
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:22,339
energy management let's say that

1615
01:26:17,859 --> 01:26:25,519
includes finance as well so for me if

1616
01:26:22,339 --> 01:26:29,059
there's a point when we run out of money

1617
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:31,789
run out of volunteer energy I'm totally

1618
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:35,260
happy to close the space and do

1619
01:26:31,789 --> 01:26:39,259
something else so so I don't think that

1620
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:42,019
sustainability is the only goal that we

1621
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:45,739
should strive for all projects have

1622
01:26:42,019 --> 01:26:50,719
their place in time and space and in the

1623
01:26:45,739 --> 01:26:52,999
market and companies go bankrupt all the

1624
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:57,379
time when something better comes so for

1625
01:26:52,999 --> 01:27:00,469
me I would be very happy if we get out

1626
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:06,559
competed by something better I just want

1627
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:08,209
I just hope that it is better ok ok I

1628
01:27:06,559 --> 01:27:11,570
just wanted to answer something from my

1629
01:27:08,209 --> 01:27:14,329
side for us sustainability means to have

1630
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:16,489
if we have small projects try to create

1631
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:18,648
them in a way thinking about the

1632
01:27:16,489 --> 01:27:21,169
worst-case scenario and always thinking

1633
01:27:18,649 --> 01:27:22,760
that ok this project cannot be that big

1634
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:28,699
that it will break our neck if it fails

1635
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:31,729
so that's what we are trying to do yeah

1636
01:27:28,699 --> 01:27:37,219
we are still in the age of experience I

1637
01:27:31,729 --> 01:27:39,050
think so yeah so I think the question

1638
01:27:37,219 --> 01:27:42,829
has been answered for the most part for

1639
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:46,219
the German project but for the various

1640
01:27:42,829 --> 01:27:49,429
police existing and upcoming where does

1641
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:51,829
the initial funding come from I mean if

1642
01:27:49,429 --> 01:27:54,409
you look around the infrastructure is

1643
01:27:51,829 --> 01:27:56,419
really good and I'm sure there is quite

1644
01:27:54,409 --> 01:28:01,188
a lot of money put into these beautiful

1645
01:27:56,419 --> 01:28:07,459
places where does it come from so I

1646
01:28:01,189 --> 01:28:10,059
think it's question to me so there are

1647
01:28:07,459 --> 01:28:11,839
two concepts one is purple is

1648
01:28:10,059 --> 01:28:14,089
represented by the building and a

1649
01:28:11,839 --> 01:28:18,050
program it's it contains it's got one

1650
01:28:14,089 --> 01:28:21,409
budget and in the Congress it has one

1651
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:24,980
as well which is separated from from

1652
01:28:21,409 --> 01:28:29,960
parallel police daily operation so

1653
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:35,959
purple is on one hand in terms of the

1654
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:39,980
daily operations costs about 350,000

1655
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:45,710
crowns per month which is in Euros like

1656
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:49,400
help me to recalculate ten thirty

1657
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:51,650
thousand euros per month which is the

1658
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:54,829
basic cost we we have to burn every

1659
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:59,409
every month and at the very beginning

1660
01:28:54,829 --> 01:29:02,630
when the costs were lower it was from

1661
01:28:59,409 --> 01:29:06,159
significant part covered by our Board of

1662
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:13,460
donors which is a type of membership

1663
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:18,290
were usually people from from business

1664
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:23,230
and some successful businessmen help us

1665
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:28,790
to cover the cost with their strictly

1666
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:30,968
done set fees but beside that we got

1667
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:35,559
other memberships for example co-working

1668
01:29:30,969 --> 01:29:39,590
has its own membership that helps to to

1669
01:29:35,559 --> 01:29:43,369
cover other other activities Bitcoin

1670
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:46,880
coffee is almost around zero it was

1671
01:29:43,369 --> 01:29:49,848
always losing concept but but now we are

1672
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:52,429
getting closer and closer that it's at

1673
01:29:49,849 --> 01:29:56,780
least on zero hopefully one day it will

1674
01:29:52,429 --> 01:30:00,230
even generate money then when when we

1675
01:29:56,780 --> 01:30:02,570
had very hard times when we out a lot of

1676
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:06,500
money really a lot of money like three

1677
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:11,960
monthly budgets we we helped with some

1678
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:15,969
commercial events in in propolis where

1679
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:18,380
we try to curate which companies come

1680
01:30:15,969 --> 01:30:23,139
some fails happened as well for example

1681
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:26,270
the national railroad operating some

1682
01:30:23,139 --> 01:30:29,570
event there which we didn't know about

1683
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:31,460
because it was via some agency so we

1684
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:34,610
learned a lesson then we asked more

1685
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:37,090
questions before it but it happens when

1686
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:41,420
we have really financial troubles when

1687
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:45,140
some now I think we are in a shape where

1688
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:49,969
it works and and we get it's not that

1689
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:54,230
not bad we already know how to keep the

1690
01:30:49,969 --> 01:30:56,390
budget not too tight and there are other

1691
01:30:54,230 --> 01:31:03,049
projects that sometimes generate money

1692
01:30:56,390 --> 01:31:06,890
sometimes don't Congress for last two

1693
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:09,080
three years brings always some money to

1694
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:14,210
Perryopolis as well because it's it

1695
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:16,880
sometimes generates money so so this is

1696
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:19,280
also some significant income then we can

1697
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:20,570
then invest to projects like this and

1698
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:25,120
track as well

1699
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:30,110
etc so so the budget has really lots of

1700
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:35,510
lots of boxes and it's always a question

1701
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:38,870
of good luck good program a good good

1702
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:42,890
exchange price of crypto etc etc that

1703
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:47,030
there are factors that have some

1704
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:49,520
footprints on our financial condition I

1705
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:52,400
would like to add well pal police in

1706
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:55,340
Bratislava is very similar to where we

1707
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:57,290
get our money from but I think I would

1708
01:31:55,340 --> 01:32:01,070
rephrase the question because if people

1709
01:31:57,290 --> 01:32:03,980
ask this question like this it's going

1710
01:32:01,070 --> 01:32:06,410
it's I think it's most often leads to a

1711
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:09,830
lot of trouble so the right question to

1712
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:13,969
ask is who are we serving who who are we

1713
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:17,180
helping what are we improving so we are

1714
01:32:13,969 --> 01:32:21,560
here for the community so community in a

1715
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:25,070
way has to generate some income usually

1716
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:31,489
they buy hipster flat whites and blood

1717
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:34,580
proof coffees and pay for for entrance

1718
01:32:31,489 --> 01:32:39,080
fees for for events and so on so this is

1719
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:41,780
one source but we don't want to ask a

1720
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:44,510
question how do we get money from the

1721
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:45,170
community we want to ask what can we do

1722
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:48,710
for the calm

1723
01:32:45,170 --> 01:32:51,590
unity and then the second part is that

1724
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:53,960
we can charge for but the first part is

1725
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:57,530
more important what are we actually

1726
01:32:53,960 --> 01:33:00,050
bringing so even the board members we

1727
01:32:57,530 --> 01:33:02,809
are not asking you know who is willing

1728
01:33:00,050 --> 01:33:06,230
to give us money we are asking ok we are

1729
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:09,860
building ecosystems who who are the

1730
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:11,989
people that want that have their their

1731
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:14,299
interest in these ecosystems being

1732
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:16,699
improved are there crypto investors

1733
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:19,250
meaning investors that invested in

1734
01:33:16,699 --> 01:33:22,820
cryptocurrencies themselves are there

1735
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:25,429
investors that invest in companies are

1736
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:28,880
these people entrepreneurs who would

1737
01:33:25,429 --> 01:33:32,000
like more freedom in entrepreneurship

1738
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:34,160
are these people who are successful in

1739
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:38,929
life and want to improve their personal

1740
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:42,320
freedom so again the question to ask is

1741
01:33:38,929 --> 01:33:45,590
not where to get money from but who do

1742
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:47,870
we serve what do we provide and what is

1743
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:50,600
the value of that and then that answers

1744
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:56,030
all the all the money questions and then

1745
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:58,400
the second part is luck thank you I have

1746
01:33:56,030 --> 01:34:01,910
a special question that may be

1747
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:06,139
interesting for all people so the

1748
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:08,239
question is did you have any problems

1749
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:11,679
with the government or did you feel any

1750
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:16,940
pressure from the government so

1751
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:20,120
especially German guys let's make it

1752
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:22,239
quick from our side not special problems

1753
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:28,940
special issues but Germany in general is

1754
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:33,709
kind of 19th century area in fall crypto

1755
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:35,030
and we are not providing any we have SS

1756
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:38,080
that conference and meetups and

1757
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:40,790
workshops and they are not there is no

1758
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:42,410
no reason why they can ban it or

1759
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:45,560
something like this it's a about

1760
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:47,570
education I come together so yeah we

1761
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:50,900
don't have any own token or something

1762
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:54,769
like this probably has a different

1763
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:57,759
opinion I can clearly state that room 77

1764
01:34:54,770 --> 01:35:03,610
is the most text audited bar

1765
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:06,310
the planet this is also due to lack of

1766
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:08,620
knowledge on the side of the of the of

1767
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:15,640
the text people like they see Bitcoin

1768
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:17,830
and you must be a tax evader whereas I'm

1769
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,330
like I mean I mean we don't accept

1770
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:23,710
credit cards or anything that means we

1771
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:27,970
accept fiat cash and Bitcoin and I told

1772
01:35:23,710 --> 01:35:30,310
texts people from the text office text

1773
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:34,780
auditors that I take it as a personal

1774
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:38,830
insult that they think I'm so stupid to

1775
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:42,370
cheat Texas with a 5 or 10% that we make

1776
01:35:38,830 --> 01:35:48,580
in Bitcoin and not with a 90 or 95% we

1777
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:50,620
make in cash fiat money yeah

1778
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:54,070
that's literally all I can say about

1779
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:56,650
that yeah the German government is very

1780
01:35:54,070 --> 01:36:01,599
unfriendly towards Bitcoin I think it's

1781
01:35:56,650 --> 01:36:04,839
the most hostile Bitcoin hostile

1782
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:07,020
government at least in Europe one good

1783
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:10,270
example for is a local Bitcoin they

1784
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:12,600
cancelled their service in Germany three

1785
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:15,490
or four years ago and I think we have

1786
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:17,710
four countries in the world where local

1787
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:19,269
bit code does not act one is North Korea

1788
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:20,350
maybe and one is Germany and that's

1789
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:23,140
ridiculous

1790
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:24,550
I don't know exchange in Germany I mean

1791
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:27,220
it speaks for how we have one that's

1792
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:28,810
what we found at one but can't have 34

1793
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:34,950
years ago so you can use it instead of

1794
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:40,890
local Bitcoin for German area for us we

1795
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:43,900
experienced trouble in a way that every

1796
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:49,270
Slovak entrepreneur experiences trouble

1797
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:52,179
meaning we wanted a simple building

1798
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:55,830
construction permit for our renovation

1799
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:58,540
and it took more than a year it's not

1800
01:36:55,830 --> 01:37:01,019
probably because anyone is hostile

1801
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:04,440
against us it's just

1802
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:08,550
that's for some weird reason you need

1803
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:13,200
permits to do basic home renovation or

1804
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:19,550
building renovation so so far as Slovak

1805
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:24,540
government doesn't attack a space

1806
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:28,860
specifically on the other hand they they

1807
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:30,450
butter everyone in general so our

1808
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:32,849
trouble with the government is certainly

1809
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:37,040
the same that's a lot of entrepreneurs

1810
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:43,040
and a lot of personal a lot of persons

1811
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:47,930
experience there is there is of course

1812
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:52,860
the whole situation about crypto we have

1813
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:56,220
probably the worst law on crypto

1814
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:58,799
taxation even worse than in Germany

1815
01:37:56,220 --> 01:38:01,830
because you have to pay taxes on profits

1816
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:05,550
but you cannot offset losses so you

1817
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:09,510
always have to pay positive taxes the

1818
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:12,840
problem or not a problem and the feature

1819
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:16,130
is that Slovak government is thankfully

1820
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:22,410
very inefficient in doing anything

1821
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:27,260
enforcement of laws so so I like to say

1822
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:29,220
I say this after experiences

1823
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:33,240
experiencing the Panamanian government

1824
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:35,940
and how they function it is often a very

1825
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:37,920
good thing that the government doesn't

1826
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:43,230
work and the government services don't

1827
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:44,520
work because because then they can cause

1828
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:47,459
less trouble of course it's not a

1829
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:50,190
universal truth but for some people that

1830
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:52,530
want to improve the function of the

1831
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:58,259
government through electron ization or

1832
01:38:52,530 --> 01:39:00,990
through for example I don't think that

1833
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:03,750
the tax laws are that different between

1834
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:06,570
Germany and Czech Republic or Slovakia

1835
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:08,520
the problem is that the tax office in

1836
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:11,559
Germany actually does something and

1837
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:16,780
works which your ex

1838
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:19,540
first hand and it's the same with for

1839
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:22,450
example in Germany if you download a

1840
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:25,870
movie or a music from torrent from your

1841
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:27,820
own IP address you will get a fine of

1842
01:39:25,870 --> 01:39:30,040
two or three thousand euros and it's

1843
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:33,429
very hard to fight it we have the

1844
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:35,590
exactly same law but no one is able to

1845
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:38,650
enforce it because no one because they

1846
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:41,860
don't know how so it's not about what is

1847
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:44,530
written in the magic documents of the

1848
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:47,530
government that's guys in Parliament

1849
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:49,420
vote for but what the government does

1850
01:39:47,530 --> 01:39:53,200
and actually does so for us the

1851
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:55,360
experience is that we have sometimes

1852
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:59,160
very set and sometimes very happy that

1853
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:59,160
the government doesn't work that much

1854
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:06,070
what about whatever the check check tax

1855
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:08,290
office and parallel import is Prague

1856
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:11,889
yeah like generally I can tell that

1857
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:16,690
Peroni police is privileged by the state

1858
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:19,750
not prosecuted by privileged it it's

1859
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:22,059
strange and we didn't expect this when

1860
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:25,390
we found it we hope that there will be

1861
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:29,590
lots of clash and conflicts and we'll be

1862
01:40:25,390 --> 01:40:31,720
chaining our bodies to the entrance in

1863
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:34,180
front of the TV cameras and so on but

1864
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:36,040
nothing like this happens really and the

1865
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:38,250
opposite happens we are privileged so

1866
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:41,200
for example when there came the

1867
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:45,700
obligation of electronic evidence of

1868
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:48,420
payments we just put over on our door

1869
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:51,639
statement that we will not do it yet

1870
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:56,470
simply and that we don't agree with that

1871
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:59,650
and when when the when the officers that

1872
01:40:56,470 --> 01:41:02,560
should enforce this rule came they just

1873
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:05,530
started the procedure two and a half

1874
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:07,810
years ago and never never made the

1875
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:09,670
second step like to continue with it

1876
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:12,070
they just made a protocol and that

1877
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:15,400
that's how it finished or I don't know

1878
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:18,059
if finished but so far so far that was

1879
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:21,160
the only only action they have taken and

1880
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:24,010
there there is one interesting story as

1881
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:25,239
well there there came a professional

1882
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:28,239
lawyer to do two

1883
01:41:25,239 --> 01:41:31,419
Coffee late in the evening and he bought

1884
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:34,360
a glass of wine and he insisted that he

1885
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:36,670
must be it must be possible to pay in

1886
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:39,098
check cash because this is how the law

1887
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:40,809
is written when you when you provide

1888
01:41:39,099 --> 01:41:44,019
some services and check in Czech

1889
01:41:40,809 --> 01:41:46,480
Republic you are obliged to accept Czech

1890
01:41:44,019 --> 01:41:51,039
currency and there was a Roman tease one

1891
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:57,009
of the co-founders who met this guy and

1892
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:59,469
and he said sorry I can't help you I

1893
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:02,019
only can do that I can pay it for you

1894
01:41:59,469 --> 01:42:04,809
but he said no I don't want you to

1895
01:42:02,019 --> 01:42:05,739
invite me I simply want to pay under

1896
01:42:04,809 --> 01:42:08,980
Mundy's okay

1897
01:42:05,739 --> 01:42:11,589
so give me your give me your note the

1898
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:12,449
banknote he gave it to him he smashed it

1899
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:17,079
to pieces

1900
01:42:12,449 --> 01:42:22,419
this is a that's this done okay so the

1901
01:42:17,079 --> 01:42:25,268
guy called police the Dro Monte's is

1902
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:27,789
damaging Czech currency and later on

1903
01:42:25,269 --> 01:42:31,090
just the Czech National Bank stated that

1904
01:42:27,789 --> 01:42:36,070
mmm it's irrelevant because the the

1905
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:38,829
value of the banknote is like 0.2 crowns

1906
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:42,058
so it's such a small damage that they

1907
01:42:38,829 --> 01:42:47,259
won't do anything about that

1908
01:42:42,059 --> 01:42:49,659
so they've never made any significant

1909
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:51,789
action against us we've got a couple we

1910
01:42:49,659 --> 01:42:55,268
had a couple of controls like hygiene or

1911
01:42:51,789 --> 01:43:00,599
all these ons from from the office we're

1912
01:42:55,269 --> 01:43:04,630
kind very closing ICS we understand that

1913
01:43:00,599 --> 01:43:07,300
that you are nonprofit and let's just

1914
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:12,760
put something small some small breeches

1915
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:16,090
there and we had it's not fashionable

1916
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:19,900
but maybe maybe I should I should just

1917
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:22,539
clarify that para una police Prague is

1918
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:26,320
the only organization in the Czech

1919
01:43:22,539 --> 01:43:30,849
Republic which publicly boycott and

1920
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:32,739
ignore public boycotts and ignores eet

1921
01:43:30,849 --> 01:43:34,030
which is called electronic evidence of

1922
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:36,879
transaction which basically means that

1923
01:43:34,030 --> 01:43:38,679
all companies all restaurants all birth

1924
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,110
in the Czech Republic they

1925
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:47,439
need to send immediately information

1926
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:51,429
about each cash transaction to to the

1927
01:43:47,439 --> 01:43:56,459
check tak office and and parent police

1928
01:43:51,429 --> 01:44:00,849
because of their ideas like and

1929
01:43:56,459 --> 01:44:03,639
protecting privacy decided officially

1930
01:44:00,849 --> 01:44:05,170
publicly boycott eet so this is quite

1931
01:44:03,639 --> 01:44:06,610
unique because a lot of people from

1932
01:44:05,170 --> 01:44:08,709
Czech Republic they used to visit

1933
01:44:06,610 --> 01:44:11,650
browning police and just and just say

1934
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:13,889
what would what would how it's possible

1935
01:44:11,650 --> 01:44:17,438
how it's possible it's done like a

1936
01:44:13,889 --> 01:44:20,519
completely boycott like a Czech law and

1937
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:20,519
we are just doing that all the time

1938
01:44:21,479 --> 01:44:25,749
like we don't have anything with the

1939
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:27,309
government yet because of the building

1940
01:44:25,749 --> 01:44:28,959
right but when we were creating the

1941
01:44:27,309 --> 01:44:31,119
organization we had to trouble with the

1942
01:44:28,959 --> 01:44:34,209
bank because we had written every we

1943
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:36,518
will be doing educational stuff in

1944
01:44:34,209 --> 01:44:41,949
economics as well and they were like oh

1945
01:44:36,519 --> 01:44:44,439
they want to not sure we want to allow

1946
01:44:41,949 --> 01:44:46,150
them to have a bank account so it took

1947
01:44:44,439 --> 01:44:48,610
some some it was a really interesting

1948
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:49,989
and after that the ladies were talking

1949
01:44:48,610 --> 01:44:51,489
to each other like oh look at them

1950
01:44:49,989 --> 01:44:54,339
they're like some IT guys they will

1951
01:44:51,489 --> 01:44:56,888
teach Excel or whatever so let them open

1952
01:44:54,340 --> 01:45:00,999
- nothing like that so that's it story

1953
01:44:56,889 --> 01:45:05,800
about the banks ok so unfortunately a we
