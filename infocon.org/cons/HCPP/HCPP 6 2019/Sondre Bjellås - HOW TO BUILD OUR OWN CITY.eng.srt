good morning good morning good afternoon

4
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:34,300
ladies and gentlemen so it is my

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,710
pleasure to introduce you our next

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:41,559
speaker his name is saundra biallas and

7
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,890
he will present you the project called

8
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,828
Libertad and it's very interesting

9
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,720
project I thought I revealed this

10
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:54,219
project maybe two or maybe three years

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:59,189
ago and I'm especially interested in

12
00:00:54,219 --> 00:01:02,759
this like a freedom freedom cities and

13
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:06,189
freedom freedom places like liberal on

14
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,439
last week I came from from Panama from a

15
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:11,619
community which is called Cal Ooyala

16
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:16,539
which is independent free city or free

17
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:20,650
village inside of jungle forest and I am

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:24,040
especially surprised that such community

19
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:26,860
exists in Norway and maybe maybe I can

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,729
tell this story about like why I'm

21
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:33,670
surprised a few years ago maybe two or

22
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:36,570
three years ago I visited one al Arco

23
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:40,270
capitalists conference other Caputo and

24
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:44,110
and the most people from Europe this

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:46,960
conference were from Norway and I was

26
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,850
totally shocked why I why you are here

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,979
guys I really don't understand you know

28
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,539
like Norway they have like a perfect

29
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,110
government like perfect services

30
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:59,950
everything there are so many analysts in

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:04,030
in Norway and now they explained me that

32
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:06,340
it's not so true and probably also will

33
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:10,269
explain us like why it's necessary to

34
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,480
create your own free city so welcome

35
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:17,470
thank you

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,600
[Applause]

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,540
so welcome everybody to my talk about

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:27,590
how to build around city my name is

39
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:30,739
summer as I mentioned and we founded

40
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:34,700
libera libera stat me and my colleague

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,890
John and it was 2 years ago in the 1st

42
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,619
of June we actually established the city

43
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,149
that's when we took over the property

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,990
where we're planning on building this

45
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,940
this potential future city so that's our

46
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:50,140
celebration every year so we're already

47
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,910
on the property so this is a photo from

48
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,940
from the last news article about

49
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,480
Libertad it's me me and John Holland's

50
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,900
lon

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,310
we're standing here in the UH Norco Park

52
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,850
and it's a park the view may look very

53
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,080
similar to the illustration here it's

54
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,560
going to be an anarchy stay it's going

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,260
to be very visible from Google Earth and

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,360
there's three pathways so one of them is

57
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,429
going to have information about the

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,500
philosophy behind volunteerism

59
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,420
anarcho-capitalism the other one is

60
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,790
going to be all about economics and in

61
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,359
the middle in the a there's going to be

62
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:29,179
plaques and information about some of

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,690
the philosophers behind the projects

64
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,730
entities here so what is labor stat is a

65
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:39,739
project to establish Norway's first

66
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:42,500
private city and by that it means that

67
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:45,140
all properties and all services are

68
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:49,750
private and delivered by private actors

69
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:52,700
in this economy and it is built on the

70
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:56,660
philosophy of anarchism non-aggression

71
00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:00,109
principle and volunteerism and these are

72
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,030
things that can be very hard to explain

73
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,310
to people in Norway because there's a

74
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,340
lot of new concepts and information to

75
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,080
people so one of the things also always

76
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,709
have to clear up with people it's like

77
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,720
this is not a separate state well it

78
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,910
will be fantastic to be able to have our

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,519
own state create our own loss and

80
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,190
everything that will be that will be

81
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,960
much harder I mean we're a very big

82
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,599
supporter of the project liberland

83
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,409
they're good friends of ours we actually

84
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,880
have dedicated

85
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,550
a property where we're gonna build their

86
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,700
embassy so liberland is gonna have their

87
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,190
Norwegian Embassy in in Libertad but we

88
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:42,469
figure out that we to do this we need to

89
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:44,570
do it do it in an existing state or end

90
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,740
goal is obviously to be able to do

91
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:51,650
something like economic free zone and a

92
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,590
special administrative sole and John had

93
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,289
a talk with Titus gable from free

94
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,419
private cities calm just two days ago

95
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,080
and he's also very supportive of the

96
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,270
project

97
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,479
he's also a person that will help us a

98
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:09,609
lot when we move further into the future

99
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,800
where we can sort of start demanding a

100
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:16,310
different set of rules maybe for this

101
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,200
project and his rig region so I always

102
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,850
had to tell the people at via need to

103
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,469
follow the Norwegian loss because that's

104
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,540
that's the first thing people say like

105
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,120
we're gonna have internal markets and

106
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,470
say oh you're gonna pay taxes right you

107
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,260
have to follow Norwegian law what is

108
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,480
someone's killed and and so forth so of

109
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,210
course we need to do this to begin with

110
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,130
but it's it's a very important principle

111
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,849
that was mentioned by Luis yesterday in

112
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,260
the talk here it was so well said the

113
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,630
thing he said he said like most people

114
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,570
don't understand the laws in the country

115
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:50,169
where I live in and I need to take the

116
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:53,659
consequences when I do some acts here in

117
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,669
Incheon and I don't know the laws nobody

118
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,030
told me Louis when I came here so should

119
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:01,010
I be punished as much as another another

120
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,510
citizen here I don't know the one thing

121
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:07,070
we need to have we need to have a full

122
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:09,740
set of regulations so we don't we can

123
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,830
avoid having to refer to the Norwegian

124
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,110
law let's say we need to have a law you

125
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,330
can't store atomic pumps on a property

126
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,220
that's probably not legal in Norway but

127
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,380
we also need to have that in our own

128
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,110
loss and it's going to be a citizen

129
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,080
contracts we're not going to have a

130
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,270
constitution but it will be our private

131
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:34,400
contract between the city company and us

132
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:37,099
any individual so this is a video as we

133
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,270
recorded I think it was in in June right

134
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,890
after we we took over the property

135
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:47,549
so before before we took over the

136
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:50,940
property we actually rented it for one

137
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:54,870
year so maybe we were able to show it to

138
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:57,750
people that came visiting the shore area

139
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,160
and everything we spent a little bit

140
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll come a little bit back to the

141
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:13,920
background also so one of the things if

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,140
you ever come up and visiting us in this

143
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,350
is in South Norway that's what he's

144
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,800
fantastic forest landscape nature and

145
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,870
everything

146
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,600
I want to thing I experienced every time

147
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:27,030
I go up there we live today like 35

148
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,620
minutes drive from Labor stat John is

149
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,989
living up there permanently with his

150
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,670
family his wife and two kids when we

151
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,650
come up there it's like you forget that

152
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,150
you have your phone in your pocket you

153
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,590
completely go off the grid and

154
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,210
disconnect because it's so fantastic

155
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,760
being up there and I'm leaving

156
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,320
everything from coding blockchain

157
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,120
project that we're working on I'm also

158
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,210
doing construction painting we're doing

159
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,780
everything and it's like John is working

160
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:53,549
every single day 8:00 to 8:00 every day

161
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:56,369
together with another guy we have up

162
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,320
there and it is so much fun for him

163
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,150
because we're able to do if you get

164
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,450
tired of painting you can go do

165
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,789
something else for a while

166
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,620
so that's that's the farmhouse in the

167
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,110
middle one and the house behind there is

168
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,920
the permanent residency where where John

169
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,920
is living today

170
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,710
it's a little bit what philosophy the

171
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:35,200
more principles behind Libertad is comes

172
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,560
from philosophers and economists and

173
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,890
thinkers that most of you already know

174
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:43,000
but when I talk with people in Norway

175
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,949
most people have never heard about these

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,740
people and I think it was so fantastic

177
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:51,670
the first news article in a local

178
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,920
newspaper about this project he started

179
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,870
digging and asking about

180
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,479
anarcho-capitalism and Murray Rothbard I

181
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,920
mean was published in newspapers was big

182
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,840
side note on the side of the article

183
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,089
where I was explaining what is

184
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,690
anarcho-capitalism and who is Mary

185
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,610
Rothbart

186
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,250
and a little bit about the book she has

187
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,680
written and that's the first time ever

188
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,900
those kind of words and definitions and

189
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,989
information have been on on press in in

190
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,430
Norway and I was just fantastic and both

191
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,210
me and John considered herself like

192
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,010
voluntarist

193
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:25,720
Norton tend to use the word definition

194
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,730
anarcho-capitalist among people and no

195
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,040
sets but most of the time I just called

196
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,020
myself an anarchist I unfortunately I

197
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,959
forgot to have a photo of my car car

198
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,480
here but it says I'm a key on the

199
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,890
license plates of my car and my wife's

200
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,600
we didn't like it too much she thought

201
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,250
how you know you're not really anonymous

202
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,900
so she said you should rather get

203
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:49,870
another plate that says anonymous so

204
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:53,170
what but if just a fun side note is that

205
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,240
I was out driving in salt Norway and the

206
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,010
same day I get a message on Facebook

207
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,590
hello and this might be a very weird

208
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,600
request but I saw your car and he

209
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,160
searched me up on the national registry

210
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,500
for my name and he found out that I was

211
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,750
an anarchist and he was an anarchist as

212
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,720
well and he was just living like 40

213
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,730
minutes away for from a real living so

214
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,310
it's actually an enabler to build a

215
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,560
bigger community and this is just to

216
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,969
illustrate that all of us here we're

217
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,489
working towards getting more and more

218
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,340
freedom but we have a huge machinery of

219
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,830
aggression against us and it's very hard

220
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,440
to compete against people that have guns

221
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,270
you just have to follow their rules

222
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,670
whatever they do but it is it is a

223
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,640
struggle and and that's what we're we're

224
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,829
doing in and we're just trying to carve

225
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,500
ourself a little bigger piece

226
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,060
of all freedom and I just also to slogan

227
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,250
for labor start it is a little piece of

228
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,400
freedom so this is a photo from the

229
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,490
first article as you can see there was

230
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:56,040
hadn't been any activity on the farm for

231
00:10:50,490 --> 00:11:00,640
quite a few years and the the forest was

232
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:05,020
well overgrown as you can see so the

233
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:09,160
history started with John Matt John was

234
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:11,530
anonymous online and I met him probably

235
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,949
a year before we started with a labor

236
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:17,260
study now we discussed maybe a few years

237
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,510
before that but I I invited him to meet

238
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,580
him I didn't know his name I was

239
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:24,220
inviting him just go here and meet and

240
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,830
then I have to be met we started falling

241
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,630
forming this idea and John had already

242
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:32,080
started thinking about he wanted to move

243
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,330
to a farm get off the city out of the

244
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,390
stressful life there but he figured it

245
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:41,260
was pretty boring moving alone with your

246
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:42,910
family through a countryside going away

247
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,900
from your friends and everything it's

248
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,719
not a thing we need to do something

249
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,209
bigger should be more than just us so we

250
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,060
got together started thinking about this

251
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:56,670
and then we also did a lot of research

252
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:59,739
finding the property there was a lot of

253
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,400
a lot of things we needed with this

254
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,080
property it couldn't be

255
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,720
agricultural land where you can grow

256
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,020
food that's that's the same as holy land

257
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,660
in Norway we have a little very little

258
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,370
arable land so it had to be forests and

259
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,439
mountains basically so it's a property

260
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:21,690
it's very big and it's mostly just

261
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,610
forced and mountains and is also

262
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:27,040
important because we need to go through

263
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,960
the zoning regulation of this property

264
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,969
to be able to allowed to build those

265
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,010
cabins they want to

266
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,270
we also learned a lot about other

267
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,780
projects around the world

268
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:41,620
I almost almost moved to call Scouts

269
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:46,089
chena myself but we all know how that

270
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,130
ended but we also wanted to take lessons

271
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,790
learned from from other products and

272
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,720
then in 2015 we made a website we

273
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,180
launched the Adi

274
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,650
as we figured like we have no idea if

275
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:00,729
this is something that people want to

276
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:02,470
and so we we couldn't take the risk of

277
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,750
this buying a property and then starting

278
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,490
selling we just instead invited people

279
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,030
to take some of the risk with us

280
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,340
so it was very cheap plots to buy well

281
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:16,089
it's obviously common to have con recent

282
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:19,270
written risk so we did a pre-sale it's a

283
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:21,850
lot of interest nothing similar have

284
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:25,120
ever been done in Norway and initially

285
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:28,090
we were accepting property properties

286
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,270
with fiat currency but once we also

287
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,190
variable 2 to 3 we use pitch bay in the

288
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:40,540
beginning to take payments with

289
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:42,130
different crypto currencies and we'll

290
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,339
just like to say thank you to everybody

291
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:48,010
that's supported a project this far I

292
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,500
think there's at least one or two or

293
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:53,470
three prop the owners in labor start the

294
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,860
conference here this weekend which is

295
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,300
fantastic and there's been a lot of

296
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,840
interest and this is a screenshot from

297
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:06,760
our statistics from website from 1st of

298
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,500
December 2015 and we have a dot-com like

299
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,980
Labor Standards calm website labor start

300
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,760
I know and in total now we're close to 1

301
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,290
million pageviews and we have that's

302
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,350
good see here it's like we have around

303
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,510
half a million unique visitors on my

304
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,250
website initially we had a lot of

305
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,990
information about the philosophy and a

306
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,810
deist and every fact everything is to

307
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,970
get people sort of learn more about this

308
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,800
because this is a new concept for for

309
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,350
most people and people that have bought

310
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,479
the property properties it's not only

311
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,700
anarchists or voluntarist

312
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,300
but it's people that share the

313
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:45,460
foundations and ADIZ about more freedom

314
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:49,359
being able to take care of themselves a

315
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:51,250
little more so it's it's we were able to

316
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,870
sort of spread the information as well

317
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:58,180
and John made this these graphics with a

318
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:01,390
meme from reliever ludwig von mises

319
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:04,209
which is just fantastic and actually

320
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:06,460
want to tell it so all human progress

321
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:09,580
always happened in a manner that our

322
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,940
small minority begin to deviate from the

323
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,590
IDs and habits of the majority until

324
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,320
finally their example inspired the

325
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,820
others to take over the new way and I

326
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,180
just also what we're doing here we're

327
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,560
doing this in a small scale an iterative

328
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,760
process we don't have any big investors

329
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,540
we don't have any big plans to build

330
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:34,780
huge constructions in the beginning

331
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,579
really taking one step at a time it's a

332
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,319
little bit about the citizens now and

333
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,610
I'll have purchased properties we don't

334
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,220
know more than hundred twenty-five

335
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:49,810
property owners from 33 or 34 countries

336
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:54,550
I think maybe Australia of the 34 fourth

337
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:56,530
country and as I mentioned these are

338
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,589
individuals to share a lot of the same

339
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,530
ideas this is not all graphics but it

340
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,960
shows sort of the distribution of

341
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:08,140
property owners in in labour stad we

342
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,860
have people from from South Africa from

343
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:18,040
Hong Kong from China from all of Europe

344
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:20,830
from the US and and a lot of people are

345
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,680
also from Vasile so here are some photos

346
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:26,020
from both the the summer party that we

347
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,270
have we have did a Libertad freedom

348
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,430
festival every year next year we're

349
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:34,689
changing it up to become a week-long

350
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:38,199
festival with workshops presentations

351
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,510
talks and training everything and yes

352
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,960
these are some photos at the bottom here

353
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:48,189
you can see these are photos from John

354
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:51,310
took the property owners on a trip into

355
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:55,600
the area where they where they will get

356
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:57,069
their properties to build cabins so a

357
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,250
little bit about the property this is a

358
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:05,950
photo static when he rented the property

359
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:07,720
and it's like the just serene fantastic

360
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:12,089
nature what you will see here is like on

361
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,589
this photo here it's completely grown

362
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,599
forest here but this is where we have

363
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,020
the barracks today so you will see some

364
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:22,339
of the different stuff

365
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,540
and and this photo is from the the lake

366
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,569
on the top where we have the

367
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:29,510
heart-shaped island and then on the top

368
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,320
of this building that's where I took

369
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,660
this photo

370
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,399
it's a panorama photo and you can

371
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,250
actually look down to labor start here

372
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,960
this this produce this mountain area

373
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,420
this part of the deliver star property

374
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,310
and then this is down in the sort of

375
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,500
entrance area you have the

376
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,389
anarcho park here this is the old

377
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,770
farmhouse and this is where John is

378
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:53,900
living and this guy he started hanging

379
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,180
around the property when we were working

380
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,610
up there and it was he wasn't afraid at

381
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,260
all so he was kidding coming all the way

382
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,620
up close to us when I'm working there

383
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:10,970
and we we gave him my name and his name

384
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:12,679
is Ludwig von mooses so this is one of

385
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,400
the first graphics that we showed of the

386
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:20,030
property so sort of separated it into

387
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,890
different districts so the yellow one is

388
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:25,250
the central district some of the city

389
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:28,130
center and on the top and we're gonna

390
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:32,090
build an outdoor concert stage where we

391
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:37,160
can have 4,000 people coming there for

392
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:39,679
concerts and part of the concept with

393
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,740
Labor stat is that this is a bit outside

394
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,620
the main city but we want to be able to

395
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,980
host people so they can stay there

396
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,449
having cheap options for for for staying

397
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,670
the night so they don't need to travel

398
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,440
home after a party in an evening and

399
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:57,350
also stay there for four week in so

400
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,430
longer times and then beside the city

401
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,320
centre that's where we're gonna have the

402
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:04,820
camping site people can live with rvs

403
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,889
and all the property owners they of

404
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:11,270
course have free camping site until

405
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:15,350
their property is sold and then we have

406
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:18,050
by the cabin town and Industry area as

407
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:21,560
well and we're gonna build a type of

408
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:24,200
offices especially I want to start

409
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:27,409
incubator programs up in Libertad to

410
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,540
entice developers and startups and and

411
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:31,940
new thinkers to come together up there

412
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:37,899
be able to live cheaper than in

413
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:41,179
a outside society and also have the

414
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:44,418
forest and a quiet area around to

415
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:46,730
focused on innovation and IDs this is a

416
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:51,259
much more detailed sketch that we're

417
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:56,090
working on city centre it's in Norwegian

418
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:58,220
but yeah so a couple of these we have in

419
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,360
this is the very very driving in so one

420
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,860
of the things we wanna do is we want to

421
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,990
have the parking at the very very

422
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,090
beginning so everybody should park the

423
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,340
car and then it's mostly car free in the

424
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,168
rest of the area but you have the road

425
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,449
going down here which will be the road

426
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:13,129
that goes to the the properties and then

427
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,320
we have also down our Coppock Park

428
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:17,870
building here this is a playground big

429
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,309
playground for for children and then

430
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:26,539
these are the buildings that we ran that

431
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:28,850
ASIC exists already unless you saw in

432
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:31,850
the first photo the property is like 2

433
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:35,418
to 2 separate once so we have an initial

434
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:37,129
agreement to be able to buy some of the

435
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:43,190
property in in-betweener so we get them

436
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:45,019
connected to each other and yeah this at

437
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,529
the bottom here is we need to have our

438
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:50,480
own sewage and renovation in in labor

439
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:52,519
stud because we need to be as

440
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,100
self-sufficient and self sustained as

441
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:58,490
possible we obviously we obviously won't

442
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:01,730
have neurosurgeons in Libertad in the

443
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:04,539
immediate future maybe in maybe in the

444
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,710
long term but we want to provide all

445
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,269
public services so you're not going to

446
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,740
be able to get public water up here

447
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:12,799
you're not going to be able to get

448
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,409
public sewer it has it's a pro it's a

449
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,330
private service that we will Bailey and

450
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,519
provide but it's not you're not

451
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,830
obligated to connect to this if you just

452
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,659
want to have a huge tank on your

453
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,000
property you can do that and then you

454
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:28,129
can buy for buy it as a service to get

455
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,970
it emptied and you can even go to any

456
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:35,539
any provider one two three dots so it's

457
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:39,350
a it's an evolving city we're doing it

458
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:42,860
iteratively so the growth will be where

459
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:45,679
natural and gradual and at least to the

460
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,740
extent that is possible within the law

461
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,180
so what we've done so far is renovating

462
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,530
the existing buildings we haven't

463
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,070
started any construction of new

464
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:59,990
buildings because we need to importantly

465
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:02,450
of course supply application to do

466
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:07,610
anything like that this is another video

467
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:10,930
this is from August 2017 we were

468
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:14,870
fortunate enough to get some donations

469
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:18,710
and also got a big loan from a friend of

470
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:21,919
mine to to buy the excavator so we have

471
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:24,770
this huge excavator up there oh and a

472
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:31,720
big dumper dumper truck a lot of other

473
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:36,680
equipment yeah so this is a video from

474
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:39,470
just after we bought the property and we

475
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,280
started digging as soon as possible

476
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,280
after we bought the property

477
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:10,330
so the area you saw there and that's the

478
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:14,289
the only area that where we can grow any

479
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:16,178
food or anything like that today on this

480
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:19,389
property but hopefully I think a lot of

481
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:21,729
the property owners they want to work

482
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:27,090
there on their own properties and grow

483
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:27,090
some food or vegetables by themself

484
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,110
so we at least try as as good as

485
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,720
possible to do what we can within the

486
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:50,679
legal framework that is there but we've

487
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,350
had to three visits and sort of reviews

488
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:58,080
of stuff going up up there and there's

489
00:23:53,350 --> 00:24:03,370
obviously ways of understanding the law

490
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:06,939
we are obviously not lawyers and unders

491
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:09,340
so it's obviously we try to your best

492
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:12,100
ability to to follow the laws that

493
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:16,050
exists but we were actually informed

494
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:19,659
that we were not even allowed to store

495
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:21,309
trees that we cut down and store them

496
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,230
for winter storage that is something

497
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:26,740
actually need to to ask for permission

498
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,840
and apply for and I'm pretty sure 0% of

499
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,780
Norwegian farmers ever ask the

500
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,720
government to be allowed to put timber

501
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,550
in in their in their own properties but

502
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,370
obviously we will get scrutinized

503
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,690
because this is a project that's it's a

504
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,159
fairly good amount of Norwegians knows

505
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:46,090
about this product we've been on

506
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:49,059
national news 7 o'clock on Saturday

507
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:52,090
which is sort of the best air time it's

508
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:54,309
been on a newspaper we also have New

509
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,770
York Times has been asking us for a long

510
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:59,830
time to come there stay there a week to

511
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:03,370
do a big article there was this pretty

512
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:08,139
big article in on a switch newspaper as

513
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:10,570
well just a month ago so we will get

514
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,330
scrutinized and people will look at this

515
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,340
product for many different angles so I

516
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,230
just need to do your best so this is

517
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,139
from the top we've had this fantastic

518
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,780
heart-shaped island and this will

519
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,950
hopefully maybe be able to be or water

520
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,389
source in the in the city

521
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,460
so let's mention there's two properties

522
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:33,010
here as you can see that it's not part

523
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,400
of Libra star today it is holiday homes

524
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:40,330
for some people living close by Sanders

525
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:44,530
the closest permanent resident he lives

526
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:47,428
a bit far down this dirt road here so in

527
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:50,590
the in this area there's no permanent

528
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:52,210
residents except John and there's also

529
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:56,350
no Highway

530
00:25:52,210 --> 00:26:00,239
so there's like there's no noise and

531
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,238
there's almost no airplanes going over

532
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:14,509
so there's photos of some of the

533
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:17,389
equipment that we purchased just having

534
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:19,190
this excavator it's like super super

535
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:20,718
good thing to have because it's much

536
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,109
more effective I'm standing there with a

537
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:23,499
shovel

538
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:25,579
and we also have other kinds of

539
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:27,319
agriculture equipment there's also our

540
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:29,749
sawmill on the property and I was

541
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,509
already there when they took it over so

542
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:33,919
and this is fantastic to be able to

543
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:36,769
create your own construction material

544
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,829
and we also for all the stuff that can't

545
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:42,889
be made into materials you make it into

546
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:45,049
firewood that we can sell

547
00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:46,849
currently externally but also eventually

548
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:48,918
we can be able to sell it to some of the

549
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:51,678
other property owners this is a photo

550
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,509
from outside the city center by me and

551
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:58,639
John were laying some bricks this summer

552
00:26:53,509 --> 00:27:00,589
and I was gonna have a big open

553
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:03,408
fireplace here it's gonna be like a

554
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:05,719
small intimate concert stage on the top

555
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:08,149
there we want to focus a lot up on about

556
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:10,929
our own culture and entertainment or

557
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:13,819
everything so eventually we will have

558
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,079
this will be the smallest stage and then

559
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:17,359
we're going to have a big stage in here

560
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,859
and outdoor it's gonna be there and then

561
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,439
we have another building we're gonna

562
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:23,468
build a restaurant and an estate estate

563
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,479
as well so there will be a four stages

564
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:29,199
where we'll be able to do presentations

565
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:32,659
and events such as this but also more

566
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:35,690
music type of events and inside the

567
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:37,669
inside the sawmill

568
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:41,359
we started constructing as a separate

569
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:43,069
room in there to be able to to insulate

570
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:47,658
it to be able to work there in the

571
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:50,539
wintertime and I think some of you maybe

572
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:53,719
have seen a few clips from the TV series

573
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:57,129
Parks and Recreation maybe heard about

574
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:59,599
this character called Ron Swanson and

575
00:27:57,129 --> 00:28:00,829
we're gonna have a silhouette for off

576
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:05,059
here and then this is going to be the

577
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:06,379
wrong Swanson wood shop so hopefully we

578
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,329
will be able to get him to maybe

579
00:28:06,379 --> 00:28:11,359
retweeted or whatever to get some

580
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:14,779
exposure and this is the barracks

581
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,968
outside it is temp temporary barracks

582
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:19,429
that we purchased and it was the

583
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:20,810
stupidest stupidest idea ever to buy

584
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:25,850
this

585
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:28,340
these barracks used because we spent so

586
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:31,459
much time renovating them and I was

587
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:34,520
leakage and another thing so should

588
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,140
instead just bought new ones the

589
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,430
government people are obviously not too

590
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:44,240
happy about this because there's there's

591
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:46,010
a shower here it's a full bathroom it's

592
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,050
by basically it's not something at me we

593
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,460
made but it's like not to be happy about

594
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,470
that and they're not too happy about

595
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,840
people sleeping over here because it's

596
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,420
supposed to only be for construction

597
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:01,490
workers being able to have a cup of

598
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:03,260
coffee so but the law in Norway allows

599
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,760
you to have construction barracks on the

600
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,390
site so as long as you're doing

601
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:14,120
construction work and this is the city

602
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:15,410
centre so part of the deal if the the

603
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,830
fixing up that we've done is basically

604
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:20,480
not changing anything so we've been

605
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,480
fixing up the office which used to be an

606
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,430
office there's a big big kitchen here

607
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,920
let me fixed up and they want to be it's

608
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,050
gonna be like you can get some fast food

609
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,730
and then we have inside the building

610
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,710
here and this is some of the

611
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,930
construction we've done inside made a

612
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:41,180
new entrance area and we have to build

613
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:45,140
this a pretty big stage inside so last

614
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:46,970
summer at Libertad Freedom Festival when

615
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,220
we had all the property owners that came

616
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:51,110
over we had this fantastic pan they

617
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,470
actually don't exist any longer

618
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:57,879
they're from Oslo and they came and held

619
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:00,200
a concert for us in his in his building

620
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:04,160
this is not a building we were planning

621
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,930
on having a restaurant and one of the

622
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,350
ideas we got here was maybe to have this

623
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:11,750
type of a narco graffiti wall and maybe

624
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,490
just as a way to in getting some some

625
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,400
finance into the products and we could

626
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:20,230
sort of people could pay I don't know a

627
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:22,970
certain sum to get like one by one metre

628
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,610
graffiti thing on this big wall and we

629
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:27,770
could have a lot of cool things going on

630
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:31,300
so that's just an idea we haven't put it

631
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,300
into into

632
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:37,610
practice yet so we obviously face a lot

633
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,730
of challenges here in this product and

634
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:45,050
one of them is the public view we have

635
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:50,090
been fortunate enough that most of the

636
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:52,790
newspapers and and the news in the media

637
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:55,040
have been positive they don't sort of

638
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:57,920
try to put a negative spin on it in any

639
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,629
way so we're very grateful for that but

640
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,940
a lot of people some people don't

641
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:04,610
understand it at all and they go around

642
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,920
like speaking with the neighbors about

643
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,679
what is this labor start projects and

644
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,910
then the rumor starts and

645
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,290
miscommunication everything but one of

646
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,000
the nice thing is that those people

647
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,120
actually come up to us to talk with us

648
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,650
most of them they just wanted to check

649
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,750
by because they were driving around the

650
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:23,260
neighborhood or whatever and some of

651
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:26,360
this they stay all night all evening

652
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,520
talking with us about philosophy about

653
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,439
anarchism about Bitcoin and

654
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,310
cryptocurrencies and everything is just

655
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,530
fantastic

656
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:36,320
so most people have come up there and

657
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:38,180
talked with us they're there and when

658
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,020
they go back home there they will

659
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:44,570
evangelize the message of Libra star and

660
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,889
others it was very very nice but

661
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,620
politicians day they don't they don't

662
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:51,520
understand things very well so when we

663
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:55,040
say that we don't want violent people

664
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:57,320
buying properties in liber start the the

665
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:01,190
politicians think that we are racists

666
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:06,290
and they go into the media and they say

667
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:09,920
that way this is a selection Society and

668
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:12,920
they compare us with with racist and

669
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,840
like oh hold on a minute we have people

670
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,960
from everywhere on the wall we only

671
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:20,540
judge individuals we don't care anything

672
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,700
other than that and you are as an

673
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,990
individual but that it's also been been

674
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,870
very hard to actually get the

675
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,730
politicians to understand this and and

676
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:31,310
it's been exchanged as well in the

677
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,140
municipality basically the Labor Studies

678
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,300
today established in a municipality

679
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,100
called mana doll which is disappearing

680
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,710
because it's joining together with two

681
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,939
others so it's gonna be the majority of

682
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,400
people that you're going to work with

683
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,440
going forward it's different kind of

684
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,159
keep people it's only some of them are

685
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,450
same people but that's also an issue

686
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,720
zoning plan it's gonna take a lot of

687
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,769
work that's a big thing but another more

688
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,340
important thing is that we're

689
00:32:54,769 --> 00:33:00,019
establishing a new society and I mean so

690
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,899
as mentioned was mentioned here during

691
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,700
the Q&A here we're all insane and people

692
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:07,610
think you are crazy and we are crazy and

693
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:10,970
this is an insane project it's it's just

694
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:12,590
so incredibly huge undertaking but weed

695
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,350
we need to do it we can't just sit

696
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:18,769
online chatting and longer so we need to

697
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:21,350
do something so in regards to

698
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:23,720
establishing a new society that is an

699
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:26,379
area where I think a lot of you can help

700
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,330
and contribute to this project because

701
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,799
stuff like private law how to make

702
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,230
contracts and agreements all those

703
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,450
things we need help from you so we're

704
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,370
going to launch a project to have a

705
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,889
collaborative project to come up with

706
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:43,100
what we call the citizens contract which

707
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:45,620
is not sure who coined it but it is in

708
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,949
from the in the book free private cities

709
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,779
by TARDIS cable so as mentioned we're

710
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:54,019
not gonna have constitution but it will

711
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:55,789
still be in this private contract and we

712
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:58,070
also be into developer two alternative

713
00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:00,799
methods what the government does today

714
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,590
sort of a sewer and we need to have a

715
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,918
fire truck we need to have security we

716
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,980
need to have emergency room and all

717
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,780
those things an image I could rely on

718
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:14,569
the government for some of those

719
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,280
services but we're also there gonna be a

720
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:18,168
lot of people here eventually so we need

721
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,179
to have those services locally in case

722
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:22,578
of a fire for example we need to be able

723
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:25,179
to at least help out a little bit

724
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:26,960
initially another thing is fine and

725
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:29,859
financing all the construction

726
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:35,359
everything we have not done any ICO or

727
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:37,489
big got any big investors helping us out

728
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,889
on its product and there's many reasons

729
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:43,368
for that one is then we need to get the

730
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:45,409
zoning plan first accepted and gone

731
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:47,990
through and then we can maybe go and ask

732
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,429
for bigger investment investment and we

733
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:51,368
know that a lot of the property owners

734
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:53,389
they have some very good at ease about

735
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:54,980
offices and buildings that they want to

736
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:57,800
construct if they're so we know that

737
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,950
there's there's a lot of will to get

738
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,170
things

739
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,390
going and working up here another thing

740
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:08,460
is also human human resources that's

741
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:09,990
also I think that there's gonna be a

742
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,150
problem because we're not that many

743
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:16,859
people see if one day one wanna anyone

744
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:21,030
want to contribute in any way it's feel

745
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:24,180
free to send us an email so this is the

746
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:26,910
last drone video or I mean the latest I

747
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:31,169
have a one at the end as well this is

748
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:32,368
from April and as you can see here are

749
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:36,720
all things that happened in the city

750
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:40,260
center this area here we blew out a

751
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,879
little bit of the mountain or we plan or

752
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,640
plan is to blow the whole thing here to

753
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,980
pieces but is obviously also something

754
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,140
we need to need to ask the government

755
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,490
permission for or it's not basically

756
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,640
it's not getting permission it's more

757
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:55,200
like telling them not what we're doing

758
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,970
there aren't you happy about we have

759
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,319
moved this away from here now but they

760
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,980
weren't happy as I mentioned that we

761
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:03,960
were storing it in a spot that we and

762
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:14,160
asked for permission to store us

763
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:16,049
so that would you know so in in the city

764
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,200
center here we take in some of the mass

765
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:21,690
from the explosion and we also paid got

766
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,250
a lot of a lot of trucks with gravel

767
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:27,409
coming in there and

768
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,409
[Music]

769
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:48,529
so then some of the solutions to be able

770
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,790
to counter these challenges and then the

771
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,380
first one is it's going to be very

772
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,380
important and that is the internal

773
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:55,700
market same as us here in this place

774
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:59,329
it's like I didn't know about this

775
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:02,419
before I was invited to speak here and I

776
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:04,640
mean I'm getting emotional just being

777
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,970
here and seeing all these people in the

778
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,920
audience here and this few days here and

779
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,569
all those people using crypto currency

780
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,470
because we don't have stuff like that in

781
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:15,440
Norway

782
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:17,328
I ran the crypto suit together with some

783
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,730
friends and we had the 30 40 in the

784
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:21,020
first meeting and then we had 13 and 20

785
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,819
and and 10 and then a bit comprised

786
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,609
collapse to a no-brainer we just put it

787
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:26,990
down eventually but there's one thing

788
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:29,839
local production is another thing we

789
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,790
need to produce money straight away so

790
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,410
we're creating firewood today we will

791
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:35,150
also get machinery up there so we can

792
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:38,359
create pebble and different kinds of

793
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:40,099
sizes of rocks and everything and really

794
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,380
use modern technology we need to use

795
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:44,060
blockchain technologies to contract some

796
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,490
of the public services that the

797
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,470
government is controlling today one

798
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,879
example would be for instance identity

799
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:52,129
identity is going to be very important

800
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,450
in the in the society you need to be

801
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,730
able to track people if you're gonna

802
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,379
have a legal system up there and other

803
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,579
things if you have doing loans and

804
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,800
everything you need to be able to have

805
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:03,410
on a system with identity and there's no

806
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,839
area a lot of interest and worked a lot

807
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:07,368
with and one of the things we want to

808
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,339
allow people is to be named whatever you

809
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:13,460
want you can just be the public key of

810
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:14,750
your identity and that's your name if

811
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,280
you won't do that you can do that if you

812
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,740
don't have multiple identities you can

813
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,839
do that if you want to be Donald Duck it

814
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:28,689
can be rats no problem so in terms of

815
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:28,690
internal market now I'm axis office

816
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,259
we've written a little bit about the

817
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,550
website on this local production or to

818
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,990
mention this some of the things we're

819
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:39,849
doing one of the things we're planning

820
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:42,049
on doing is having having this indoor

821
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:44,569
industry building production of food

822
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:48,410
using hydroponics so we can get three a

823
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:50,060
food production 365 days a year and a

824
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,140
nice thing with this is that it's gonna

825
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,509
be local produced

826
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,190
we don't need storage space we don't

827
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,840
need to store the food we don't need to

828
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:59,030
transport the food

829
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,890
and it's gonna be make it possible for

830
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:05,900
us to actually compete with the

831
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:09,170
subsidized industry that food production

832
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,880
is today crowdsourcing is going to be

833
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:13,280
very important we already received a lot

834
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,860
of donations we have fun incident a guy

835
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,320
he sent all his Bitcoin I think it's

836
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:20,030
like 13 Bitcoin or something we've got

837
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,300
an email like oh I wasn't supposed to

838
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:25,790
send everything so obviously were nice

839
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:29,810
guys we sent it back to him and we've

840
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:31,880
got a fixed up so I just want to thank

841
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:34,400
everybody for it but I just wanted to

842
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,040
post a question to all of yous like what

843
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,780
do you want to get receive in return for

844
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,930
letting go of your cryptocurrencies I

845
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:43,490
mean I have a lot of friends and they're

846
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:46,040
hot lers some of them and I have a

847
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:48,890
friend he has never used a Bitcoin and

848
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,140
every time he buys Bitcoin as a birthday

849
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,299
present for his father but it doesn't

850
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,910
use his own Bitcoin who comes to me can

851
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,070
i buy it's more risk on for me III have

852
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:00,980
basically nothing I've already lost so

853
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:04,160
I'm a bit going twice that's no fun

854
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,530
story another idea is like adoption of

855
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,990
street names you can have companies or

856
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:11,450
people or whatever you could be able to

857
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:14,029
name a street for some sort of payment

858
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,350
order ever and then see the chain is a

859
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,270
product I've worked a lot with and it's

860
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:18,650
a blockchain

861
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,960
for powering or what I'm calling this

862
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,560
smart CD platform it's need to build out

863
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,060
of services on top of blockchain and

864
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,450
most of those services we are making it

865
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:32,000
compatible with with with Bitcoin it's

866
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:34,310
not like we are no intention of creating

867
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,750
a global currency that's gonna compete

868
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,160
with Bitcoin and that's not the idea at

869
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,690
all but we need to have our own

870
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,120
blockchain to be able to innovate and do

871
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:42,920
some of the things that we wanted to do

872
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,990
we obviously want to support Bitcoin and

873
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,550
other cryptocurrencies as well and when

874
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,500
we started this work this was three

875
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:51,080
years ago and it wasn't that easy to use

876
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,540
a cryptocurrency and it's still a little

877
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,299
bit hard especially for the average

878
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,400
farmer living in rural Norway they need

879
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,870
to be able to use this stuff then when

880
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,420
they come into labour start they need to

881
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:05,290
be able to buy it easily and use it very

882
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,430
easily but it's not only about the

883
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:09,590
consumer it's also about the merchants

884
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,700
we need to have merchant system where

885
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:13,400
people can

886
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:16,040
can be our cryptocurrency merchants and

887
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:21,590
have everything from the finances and

888
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:25,310
everything in order so I'll just quickly

889
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:28,040
skip this but you can go just google see

890
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:30,529
the chain is actually a company in Hong

891
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,720
Kong I think but if you go to city -

892
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:36,010
change.org that's the website you can

893
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,009
learn a little bit more about it

894
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:43,510
property registry is also one thing

895
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,860
we're gonna have on this system and

896
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:48,530
another very important thing is what

897
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:51,260
we're gonna have is as a CC crypto

898
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:53,810
company registry it's basically you're

899
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:57,710
going to be able to issue sidechain

900
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:59,930
tokens for a company and then have that

901
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:02,420
identity registered in the system and

902
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:06,529
that's identity we lost them can be used

903
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,330
when you're a merchant so when I one

904
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:11,330
thing in one do is like when I go a pave

905
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:15,259
and stuff and I scan it the QR code or

906
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:16,880
use NFC you're gonna see the company

907
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,700
logo you're gonna see the company name

908
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,110
and you're gonna see only the friends in

909
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,020
your current contact list

910
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:25,640
we actually approve of this company so

911
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,930
it's real reputation and this is not

912
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,240
only going to be for companies but it's

913
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:31,009
also gonna be person to person so I can

914
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,339
meet a completely stranger never met

915
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:36,470
this person before and we do an exchange

916
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,640
not gonna easily see that oh my other

917
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,689
friend is vouching for you

918
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:44,060
I think that's a very important concept

919
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:46,880
so city hub is the the portal into into

920
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:49,160
city chain just it some wallet today

921
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,820
with a little extra features but it's

922
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:56,540
gonna have a lot more in the end so this

923
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:58,210
is the last video this is recorded I

924
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:03,500
don't know year or two ago

925
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:05,540
so we experienced very very degrees of

926
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,450
snow sometimes a lot of snow sometimes

927
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:12,500
let's know this is right after the

928
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:19,089
initial snow in December or January this

929
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:21,770
year and and if you like sort of seasons

930
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:23,930
the Norway is very good place to because

931
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,410
you you get proper winter and you get

932
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:28,279
proper

933
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,960
Aurum spring and summertime but it's

934
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,910
still in the south of Norway so it's not

935
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:35,600
as cold as the middle or North Norway

936
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:45,710
and we also don't get that much snow

937
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:48,350
compared to other places so you know

938
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:51,290
let's just skip that and before I open

939
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:53,660
up for questions some dust I like to

940
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:56,180
mention that if anyone wanna volunteer

941
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,740
please go through labour static calm

942
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,779
there's enough page we have volunteering

943
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:03,229
I made a special video there's asking

944
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:05,450
people if you are 3d artists let's say

945
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:08,600
web designer I'm today responsible for

946
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:10,730
all the web sites a lot of coding and

947
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,380
also doing a lot of manual work having

948
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:15,590
some support nuts will be really nice

949
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:17,480
and before questions I will just like to

950
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:20,650
say thank you for inviting me and thank

951
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,650
you for for coming

952
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:32,779
thank you very much great project but I

953
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,450
would like to ask you about some critics

954
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:37,400
basically we heard a lot of times during

955
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:40,490
the presentation we have to ask

956
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:43,400
permission and the idea of libertinism

957
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:45,950
encryption accuses don't threat on me

958
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,580
so all the construction is very good and

959
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:53,540
the idea is marvelous but when and how

960
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:56,390
do you plan to to protect your rights

961
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:58,160
and that is the key question because if

962
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,400
you are inviting people to come there

963
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,910
it's not the concerts that will attract

964
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,430
them

965
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:06,980
it is protection of these basic rights

966
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:09,410
and additionally to that question what I

967
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,030
it's not like negative critics because I

968
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:13,609
understand that you have already faced

969
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:16,700
and made a lot so can you also explain

970
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:19,250
what it takes to establish such a place

971
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:22,279
I mean how you was fighting government

972
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:24,740
before and how much resources you have

973
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,170
required before to do that what you have

974
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:29,950
already done yep so the first question

975
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:33,320
I'll just get back to you I don't know

976
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:36,319
but I need you guys here and everyone

977
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,880
else in the crypto community to help out

978
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,100
with this figure out how we're gonna do

979
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,900
it right the meeting that John had with

980
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,120
Titus cable a couple of days ago three

981
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:47,180
days ago you mention that it's important

982
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,920
for us to just stay low now to just get

983
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:51,379
things going get things working and

984
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,690
that's also variety so we need to accept

985
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:56,030
some sort of force against us at the

986
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:57,530
moment because it wouldn't it would

987
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:59,540
never fly if we go to the government

988
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,370
before we start this project and say hey

989
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,220
we want to have a free economic zone

990
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:06,049
here in Norway can we get it it's not

991
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,609
never will happen so need to show that

992
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:10,400
it's actually working and then we can

993
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:14,330
sort of slowly try and see if there's

994
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:17,090
ways we can improve or freedom in the

995
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:21,339
city and but I must mention I mean both

996
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:24,019
me and John were were very much

997
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:26,779
lovers of the non-aggression principle

998
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:29,180
and it hurts us whenever we where we

999
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:33,500
need to sort of accept something but

1000
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:35,990
someday it will stop maybe it doesn't

1001
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:38,029
happen while I'm alive maybe but no

1002
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:40,759
children but someday people's gonna stop

1003
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:43,880
hopefully sooner than later in other

1004
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,010
parts like when we started it we coined

1005
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:48,260
something called libertine the Liberty

1006
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,880
Nia projects that's what that's what we

1007
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,380
started math I started with this what

1008
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,000
before we even start the thought that

1009
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,069
we're gonna build it so we ever think

1010
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,859
you mean let's do this open source let's

1011
00:46:55,069 --> 00:47:00,140
share all the information about the

1012
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:03,170
planning and everything but eventually

1013
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:05,538
we had to stop that and we put it into

1014
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:07,190
life basically but we need to share and

1015
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:10,369
we are very open with with everything

1016
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:12,470
that's going on we were also the the

1017
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:15,019
people working for the municipality they

1018
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:16,879
have said to us a few times that they

1019
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:18,348
were grateful that we are very very open

1020
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,240
with what we were planning on doing

1021
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:29,359
doing and giving them as much

1022
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:35,258
information that's possible yes I have

1023
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:37,880
kind of two questions question which is

1024
00:47:35,259 --> 00:47:41,089
what is the actual difference at this

1025
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,609
current moment in what the citizen of

1026
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:46,730
the Libertad has compared to the other

1027
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:51,019
citizens of North Norway and the other

1028
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:53,529
one is basically how do you plan on

1029
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:56,479
expanding or what's your expansion plan

1030
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:59,599
do you have some opportunity to buy more

1031
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,119
land or what's your area for future yeah

1032
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:05,599
two very good questions and I the first

1033
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:08,980
question I get all the time and it is

1034
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,980
something that is very hard to answer

1035
00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:13,099
we're not gonna get that much more

1036
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:15,829
freedom than we already have in our way

1037
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:17,299
there are loopholes and regulations in

1038
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:20,359
the law or the sort of that you can

1039
00:48:17,299 --> 00:48:22,819
utilize as a person but you're you you

1040
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:25,069
lose like utilizing that in a city

1041
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:27,109
doesn't give you much benefit but if

1042
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:28,970
you're together as a group you'll get

1043
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:31,029
more benefits from that the wrong thing

1044
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:33,709
would be like if you and me are trading

1045
00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:34,440
and we're doing it in cash there's no

1046
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,869
third party

1047
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,740
I can come and say hey you need to pay

1048
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:40,859
25%

1049
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:42,299
v18 on this transaction so that is one

1050
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:44,848
thing like people up there they will

1051
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:48,329
trade together and I can't enforce that

1052
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:49,440
you need to submit your tax report to

1053
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:51,240
the government on what you include

1054
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,310
they're there if you include a Bitcoin

1055
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,720
or not that's not up to me but I know

1056
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,190
that if you're trading up there and you

1057
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,430
will most likely trade with other people

1058
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:02,400
you will also use cryptocurrency then

1059
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:05,279
avoid some of the taxes but it's very

1060
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,050
hard it's like we did some research on

1061
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,849
what is possible that it's also how we

1062
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:13,829
came up with the concept of the internal

1063
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:15,750
market is there's regulation today that

1064
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:17,640
makes that possible for large

1065
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:21,839
organizations to have in a trading

1066
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:24,118
internally this is tax free but we need

1067
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,339
to find out what is possible

1068
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,880
another question is expanding we already

1069
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:32,339
had different neighbors which is mostly

1070
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,710
farmers we've approached us and they

1071
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:38,069
want to sell us more property obviously

1072
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:39,569
they want a price that we're not going

1073
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:43,859
to accept at least not at the current

1074
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:47,150
moment but it's we have a pretty huge

1075
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:50,930
opportunity to expand this very very big

1076
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,930
in area yeah

1077
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:59,469
thank you for giving this presentation I

1078
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,179
was really impressed with all the

1079
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:03,819
progress he already made and all your

1080
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:06,009
plans that are very big and which are

1081
00:50:03,819 --> 00:50:07,779
very support but besides of the

1082
00:50:06,009 --> 00:50:10,299
beautiful seasons why did you pick

1083
00:50:07,779 --> 00:50:13,359
Norway I think you like a challenge

1084
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:16,239
right yeah I and this is something I've

1085
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:19,598
had at least one year so I followed the

1086
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:23,109
golf sculls Chile for a long time and I

1087
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:25,449
had a friend of mine who did something

1088
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:27,848
like free state initiative so me and him

1089
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:29,829
we were planning on we were looking at

1090
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:32,709
the whole world trying to find a place

1091
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:36,309
an even place I think he traveled down

1092
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:38,589
to Mary Tanya there's like 99% Muslim

1093
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:40,449
country and I actually have slaves still

1094
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:41,859
down there and he wanted to get the

1095
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:45,369
contract with the government so we were

1096
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:48,429
looking at Addie's on using bamboo how

1097
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:50,829
to do food production desalination of

1098
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:54,219
water and everything and but it becomes

1099
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:56,409
such a big project huge product and you

1100
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,519
need to move with your family or travel

1101
00:50:56,409 --> 00:51:00,699
a lot so it's going to be very expensive

1102
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:03,098
so let me figure out like why can't we

1103
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:05,469
just do it in Norway nor is this very

1104
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:06,789
it's a pretty functional society and the

1105
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:08,739
fun things like people as I mentioned

1106
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:10,419
initially here is like a lot of people

1107
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:12,130
say that Norway is such a good country a

1108
00:51:10,419 --> 00:51:14,049
lot any region says that are just

1109
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:15,699
contrary to its but can't mean make it

1110
00:51:14,049 --> 00:51:17,529
better let's try to make it better let's

1111
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:20,709
see if there's other models that can

1112
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:23,439
work and make things better so when we

1113
00:51:20,709 --> 00:51:25,269
ended up deciding on Norway we figure

1114
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:27,399
out it's fantastic being in already cuz

1115
00:51:25,269 --> 00:51:29,618
we have a lot of forests here we can use

1116
00:51:27,399 --> 00:51:31,598
that it's a product we can sell as a

1117
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:34,209
product we can use we have clean water

1118
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:38,289
in all of Norwich this fantastic clean

1119
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:40,899
drinking water everywhere and then you

1120
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:42,579
also have it is a small country there's

1121
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:44,859
5 million people live in Norway Norway

1122
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:47,499
you can go anywhere and there's no

1123
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:49,269
people just in the cities almost but you

1124
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:50,379
can go to the most crazy place and

1125
00:51:49,269 --> 00:51:52,928
there's people living in there that's

1126
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:55,209
also pretty fun but Norway is one of the

1127
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:58,779
countries after Japan that has the least

1128
00:51:55,209 --> 00:52:01,598
amount of police per citizen so it's

1129
00:51:58,779 --> 00:52:04,569
like I can go a full week and I don't

1130
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:07,749
see a single cop car or seeing a cop try

1131
00:52:04,569 --> 00:52:09,250
doing that in New York there's at least

1132
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:11,230
four on each subway

1133
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:14,140
this is horrible so that some of the

1134
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:16,150
benefits benefits from it and also

1135
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:18,490
selecting an area that was pretty far

1136
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:20,710
from the main city that's also gonna

1137
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:22,839
open up more opportunities for allowing

1138
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:25,270
the regulators to approve it because

1139
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,740
it's gonna be much harder to build on

1140
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,360
your construction very close to a city

1141
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,640
but it's much easier

1142
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:35,050

when I tell them that Norway is one of

1156
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:16,750
the most gun rich countries in the world

1157
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:19,240
Norwegians loves guns we have a lot of

1158
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:21,010
guns in Norway but it's we have a long

1159
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,649
history and tradition and culture for

1160
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:26,590
for hunting and I just wanna also have a

1161
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:29,380
lot of guns it's fairly easy to get a

1162
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:31,270
gun in Norway and pistol as well you

1163

1165
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:41,790

1166
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:45,160
grew up shooting shooting rifles but

1167
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:48,100
carry limit carry gun in Norway is not

1168
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:50,020
legal I would love to to allow people to

1169
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,430
carry gun but as a civilian

1170
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,160
you're not allowed there's only one

1171
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:56,740
position in Norway that is civilian and

1172
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,379
allowed to carry a gun and that is the

1173
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:01,810
security guards at the Norwegian bank

1174
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:03,550
that's the central bank of Norway they

1175
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:08,279
are the only ones allowed to carry gun

1176
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:12,280
and policy I mean I myself I think

1177
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,750
anyone should be able to buy nukes in

1178
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,830
self-defense why not

1179
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,830
I'm not going to stop them

1180
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:27,660
so we don't we don't have any policies

1181
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:30,640
around software us as a weapon

1182
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:32,109
