[Music]

3
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,820
so welcome again it's my pleasure to

4
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,400
welcome you on slave on a stage I'm

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,890
happy that you stayed with us for the

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,070
for the next stock and it's my pleasure

7
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,760
to introduce next speaker and hit by on

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,520
stage

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,920
Harry helping happen is the CEO of

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,559
meaning technologies start-up creating

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,410
and inserting mixed net with animals

12
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,449
identification credentials previously he

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:57,440
lies research projects against violence

14
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,629
like at in RIA like panoramix and w3c

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,849
web cryptography standardization effort

16
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,769
he has also been the target of

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,800
undercover cops across multiple

18
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:07,700
countries including the infamous mark

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,120
Kennedy

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,030
so Harry floor is yours thank you okay

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,470
thanks for the intro I hope the audio is

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:23,210
okay so this I don't know how many

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:26,570
people were here two years ago at the

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:30,679
liberate conference but at that

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:34,039
conference we gave a brief demonstration

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,850
and a lightning talk on mixed networking

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:41,330
and of course this year I was very I'm

28
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,940
very happy to return to a no better

29
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,100
place to present the software than the

30
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,850
Institute for crypto Anarchy well we're

31
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,740
going to go over how we can use mixed

32
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,649
networking plus

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,039
anonymous authentication credentials to

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:01,040
essentially help build the kinds of

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,490
software that the sort of founders of

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,580
crypto Anarchy everyone from Timothy May

37
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:11,510
to David CIAM we're all sort of pushing

38
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:14,329
for back in the 90s and I think now more

39
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:19,510
than ever this kind of software is

40
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:22,220
needed so that's me that's Twitter be

41
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,160
feel free to follow us for updates

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,720
but I'd like to first dedicate this talk

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:32,390
to Timothy May he died in December 15th

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,790
last year and he really I think inspired

45
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,409
by basically inventing the term crypto

46
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,280
Anarchy and really having the vision

47
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:40,250
every

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,440
here and it's it's very it's very sad to

49
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,180
see him go but I think we you know we

50
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,630
build on the shoulders of giants and we

51
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,720
do honor to his memory by creating the

52
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:53,660
kinds of software that he envisioned and

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:57,740
what he envisioned is actually quite

54
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:00,770
clear he said that we can actually

55
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,740
communicate with each other in a totally

56
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:07,370
anonymous fashion and that this kind of

57
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,410
technology based on rerouting and public

58
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,290
key encryption and zero knowledge proof

59
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:15,500
will have such a large effect it will be

60
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,470
similar to the effect of the invention

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,830
of the printing press and alter the

62
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:25,250
relationships of power throughout all

63
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,930
society including the elimination of a

64
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,260
lot of the previous power structures

65
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,390
such as just as the printing press

66
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,730
destroyed the printing guilds I'm sorry

67
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,149
the pre printing medieval guilds and

68
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,369
reformulate society to give us

69
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,890
eventually a the nation-state industrial

70
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,620
capitalism that will in turn new kind of

71
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,649
society based on cryptography that will

72
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,269
alter the current state of nation-state

73
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,989
post Westphalia nation-states and

74
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:56,150
corporations and there was a huge war to

75
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,580
make this to make this possible this is

76
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,799
myself and Amir taki peeking over the

77
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,769
back with Phil Zimmermann and I think

78
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,510
people need to remember that you know

79
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,980
there was not only was there the

80
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:11,570
Cryptococcus manifesto but there was

81
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:14,750
literally a decade of essentially court

82
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:16,690
cases and software creation really to

83
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,760
get us to the point we could even begin

84
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:23,150
contemplating things like Bitcoin which

85
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,550
we take for granted today so I mean Phil

86
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:29,120
Zimmermann eventually tried to prove

87
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,070
that code could be considered speech and

88
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,310
he was prosecuted by the FBI for the

89
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,890
release of PGP on Usenet eventually

90
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,780
Bernstein who also did curve to five

91
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,000
five one nine and much of modern

92
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,760
cryptography and is currently working on

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,310
post quantum crypto took it all the way

94
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,620
to court and basically got it ratified

95
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,610
that code was indeed at least in the

96
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,009
United States protected under

97
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,740
free speech laws and not capable of

98
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,710
being sort of taken down as the form of

99
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,139
munitions export and it's exactly you

100
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,299
know these kinds of court cases and this

101
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,490
kind of code which prevented the

102
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,199
nightmare world of the Clipper Chip

103
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,000
we're the government have a backdoor

104
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,759
mandate into every cryptographic

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,129
technology from happening and led to the

106
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,770
sort of innovation that we saw really on

107
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:19,650
the early internet but now and this is

108
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,780
what got me interested and and Bitcoin

109
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,919
originally when I first saw Bitcoin I

110
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,179
said well you know there's gonna be this

111
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,318
huge problem no-one is possibly gonna do

112
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,659
any kind of payment where it's

113
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,830
completely transparent on a distributed

114
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:36,599
ledger who is paying who and then when I

115
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,568
saw people on the Bitcoin space became

116
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:41,340
interested in privacy it became very

117
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:44,180
clear that what we were going to see is

118
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,619
the second generation of crypto war

119
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,120
where and as we're seeing did with the

120
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,759
guidelines for various international

121
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,219
institutions court cases happening every

122
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,270
day that we are in the middle of a new

123
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:59,879
kind of essentially war on code and what

124
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,849
we need is we need new kinds of weapons

125
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,610
and these weapons will essentially be

126
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:08,610
code it's not just code is speech but

127
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:12,949
code as a weapon to accomplish our

128
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:16,580
political and social and economic goals

129
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:22,039
ideally in a manner which does not cause

130
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:24,659
let's say does not cause us to lose and

131
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:29,279
what we're seeing on on a larger front

132
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:31,229
is a transformation away from what

133
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:35,219
Foucault called disciplinary societies

134
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:37,050
so this has taken one step back these

135
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:39,110
current societies the crisis IDs that

136
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,389
were formed after the printing press

137
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,849
essentially you know everyone was in a

138
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:47,759
sort of little prison you both with

139
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:50,279
distinct rules and distinct ways of

140
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,659
being and you know you go from one to

141
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,949
the other so you were shuttled from the

142
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:59,279
family to the school maybe to the army

143
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:02,009
to factory if you got sick to a hospital

144
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,449
if you committed a crime to the prison

145
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,580
and then you died

146
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,710
but what was predicted by Geo Deleuze

147
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,099
was that we this kind of society would

148
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,628
eventually lead to a new form of

149
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:15,628
nebulous but he what William Burroughs

150
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:18,240
called control where there was no

151
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:20,279
distinct ending or beginning to control

152
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,339
there was no distinct ending or

153
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,360
beginning to any sort of these little

154
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,719
enclosures that we would find ourselves

155
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,729
in in our daily lives but that in order

156
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:32,909
to cope with this kind of society we

157
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:35,128
would also need new kinds of weapons so

158
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:37,379
it's not just the goals of crypto

159
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:39,990
Anarchy but it's really I think these

160
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:42,810
that we need new kinds of tools in order

161
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,830
to fight back for human freedom in a

162
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,289
society based increasingly on pervasive

163
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,878
surveillance and control and there's a

164
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:52,620
lot of problems so I'm going to just out

165
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,319
list them list them from a technical

166
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,319
perspective so the first problem is

167
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,449
Internet traffic is inherently

168
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,979
observable just by its nature when it

169
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,349
was designed not only was designed to be

170
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:06,449
unencrypted but that patterns are

171
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:09,899
essentially visible to anyone who's

172
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:12,659
watching on for example your ISP or your

173
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:15,839
internet exchange point so even tor when

174
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:19,050
you send packets into tor tor bounces

175
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:22,169
them through a tor circuit with multiple

176
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,389
hops but effectively anyone who's

177
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,698
watching all the hops can still

178
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:29,099
correlate the patterns of traffic coming

179
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,919
in to tour with the patterns of traffic

180
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:34,769
coming out of tor and this becomes

181
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,958
exceptionally a terrible problem when

182
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:39,769
you're doing cryptocurrency transactions

183
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,659
even anonymous cryptocurrency

184
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:45,990
including Zee cash Mon arrow member

185
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,870
Wimble they all have this problem that

186
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:52,079
when they do the puter peer sort of

187
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,180
broadcast stage that try that

188
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,550
peer-to-peer broadcast is observable in

189
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,829
any enemy and we know that chain alysus

190
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,370
does this sort of work can watch that

191
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:03,689
peer-to-peer broadcast and effectively

192
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,089
harvest exploit that metadata D

193
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,730
anonymized things on chain the originals

194
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:10,649
D cache paper basically assumes this

195
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,300
anonymous communication channel we've

196
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,560
seen interesting work from an arrow

197
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,900
trying to integrate i2p

198
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,390
tor people trying to integrate tour with

199
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,180
with grin but push comes to shove all

200
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,010
these technologies if your enemies say

201
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,400
chain analysis or the NSA whichever one

202
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,600
you prefer can watch the entire

203
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,360
peer-to-peer network traffic which is

204
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,550
not that hard given how essentially few

205
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,460
people still use these technologies they

206
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,990
can D anonymize your transactions

207
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,970
regardless of what you do on chain and

208
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,640
you know this this is a pervasive

209
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,380
problem it affects apps with centralized

210
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,120
servers such as signal but even when you

211
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,090
decentralized a server in a peer-to-peer

212
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:54,850
nodes this sort of traffic analysis is

213
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:56,890
very hard to defeat and it becomes even

214
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,170
worse because essentially what

215
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,840
technologies like tor we have further

216
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:04,180
problems so not only is the metadata

217
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,250
exposed to network but if you wanted to

218
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,469
create something that would help defeat

219
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,630
this such as tor there's no incentive

220
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,270
structure so while tors be proven itself

221
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,939
to be more more useful the number of

222
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,189
people running toralei's has essentially

223
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,440
remained fairly stagnant between six to

224
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:25,210
eight thousand for the last few years

225
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,400
and and worse even with tor you know

226
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,870
when you acts as a website because if

227
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,000
you're not using it to a browser you

228
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,710
have cookies you log in with Facebook

229
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,110
Connect you so you have these

230
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,910
centralized web apps and identity

231
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,680
providers which even if you try to

232
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,670
secure your network traffic and make

233
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:46,680
that private can de anonymize you so

234
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:49,569
what we present is which we call NIM

235
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,079
Greek for name but really we're talking

236
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,150
about anonymous and pseudonym is what we

237
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,430
consider like a three layer solution the

238
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,430
first is a mixed net and the mixed that

239
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:03,130
provides the sort of traffic level

240
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,900
privacy and we do mix that's a bit

241
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:08,230
different than lead and David Chama and

242
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,730
I'll explain how in a second it's not a

243
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,140
classical Charmy it mixed out of though

244
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,540
David Chama is a genius and we

245
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,370
appreciate his work we decided to go for

246
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,589
a different kind of design we use

247
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,510
anonymous authentication credentials

248
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,460
which is a very old technology which

249
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,319
people kind of forgot about in the

250
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,980
cryptocurrencies space in order to

251
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,950
anonymize effectively how to link into

252
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,620
the mix net and then lastly of course we

253
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,110
have

254
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,110
a sort of token based system to reward

255
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,990
people for participating in this mix net

256
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:41,480
and so let's just start to go over what

257
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:45,110
so mixed nuts were invented by David

258
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,000
CIAM they pre-existed tore and if any of

259
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,490
you were running things like cyberpunk

260
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,140
remailers you may have run ran Mixmaster

261
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,080
for example by the late Lynne Sossaman

262
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:57,770
and this technology is incredibly

263
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:01,610
impressive it features better on enemy

264
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:06,110
then tour but it has a store if you've

265
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:08,690
been a bit slow so packets come in and a

266
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:12,080
classic Charmian mix they're held and

267
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:14,810
then they're per muted mixed up shuffled

268
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,850
like a deck of cards and sent to the

269
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,670
next node and you do this a few times

270
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,400
and you get resistance against even

271
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:25,400
global passive adversaries such as the

272
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,470
NSA but the the problem of this

273
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,140
technique is that when you just shuffle

274
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,360
packets you saw them Ford like that well

275
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,680
you know you you you have to wait for

276
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,770
the packet you might never know if your

277
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,609
packets arrive the system tends to be

278
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,810
rather rather slow and so while David

279
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,310
traumas some great new work which

280
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,479
unfortunately he wasn't here to explain

281
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,369
on how to speed that up with

282
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,590
pre-computation we chose a different

283
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,780
kind of mix net called a stop-and-go mix

284
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:53,810
net and how this does is it keeps the

285
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,270
multiple hops but it does some other

286
00:12:53,810 --> 00:13:01,219
things first thing rather than waiting

287
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:04,520
for the for the next bit of traffic to

288
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,970
come in it basically just holds it for a

289
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,579
small often randomized delay and these

290
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,460
small kind of millisecond delays with

291
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:16,730
enough traffic basically help break the

292
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,830
pattern in the packets now of course if

293
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,320
there's only a few packets coming your

294
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,030
network that doesn't help you so what

295
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,190
you have to do is you have to add cover

296
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,290
traffic you have to make fake traffic so

297
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,420
it always looks like to the enemy you're

298
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,819
sampling essentially traffic from the

299
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,829
same distribution so the connections

300
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,060
between the mix nodes always have some

301
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,460
traffic coming through them

302
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,829
that's indistinguishable from the

303
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,100
traffic at a previous time period and

304
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,329
this technique also lets lets you be

305
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,759
able to

306
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:48,589
loop the traffic back so you can send

307
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,420
anonymous traffic through a mix net and

308
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:51,619
then loop it back and then that's sort

309
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,719
of like an acknowledgment that your

310
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:55,040
traffic that your packet got through so

311
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,499
if your packet doesn't get through as

312
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,689
fast as you want you can send a new

313
00:13:57,499 --> 00:14:02,720
packet and if your course if you get

314
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:06,199
sent to through you get a D essentially

315
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,179
a replay you just drop the replayed

316
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:09,889
traffic and this is fairly

317
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:12,439
straightforward to scale you can just

318
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:16,670
add more nodes if you want more security

319
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:21,170
you add nodes Devi Tom there you add

320
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:23,809
more nodes on a vertical level and if

321
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,309
you want speed you add more nodes in a

322
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:27,439
horizontal level so I think we should

323
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:29,629
all congratulate David Tom from vending

324
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,709
mixed Nets and I think if you use this

325
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:33,619
wonderful system you don't need our

326
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:35,719
system and we do support a lick sir I do

327
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:38,449
think that for other kinds of more

328
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,679
generic anonymous overlay traffic a new

329
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:42,079
kind of mix that's needed and this is

330
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,238
why we built the NIM mix net from what's

331
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,160
called the loop picks design and this is

332
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:49,519
just a quick illustration of how it

333
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,009
works so you see first thing packets

334
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,980
have to be wrapped up on the user's

335
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:56,929
computer using what's called Sphinx and

336
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,629
Sphinx is just a packet format which

337
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:01,699
makes everything the same size and it

338
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:04,100
lets you do kind of encryption

339
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:08,029
authenticated encryption hop-by-hop and

340
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:10,850
re randomized at every hop there for

341
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:12,829
breaking the links between any packets

342
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,869
so you can't for example change a byte

343
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,508
and pack it on one half and look and

344
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:20,059
find it on the other then you add in of

345
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:22,069
course multiple hops typically you know

346
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:23,660
in our current network we have nine but

347
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:27,110
you know you can add more like I said

348
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,519
more more vertically to give you more

349
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,759
security because you only need one

350
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,589
honest mix and the network passed for it

351
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,529
to be secure and unable to be d

352
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:38,360
anonymized and you can add them on the

353
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:40,579
top in order to basically get more

354
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,980
capacity if there's not enough traffic

355
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:45,319
through you add dummy trap dummy packets

356
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,879
again at each hop the packets are held

357
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,860
forbidden you can see the packets come

358
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,079
in and they pop right out and they're

359
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,160
essentially anonymize that's read and

360
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,748
they go to whatever service you want

361
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,419
them to go and you can look in

362
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:58,140
comparison to tor where the traffic the

363
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:00,350
Patt traffic comes in but it

364
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,149
that after a few hops which is fine for

365
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,310
obscuring your geolocation but that's

366
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:07,350
really all it does you still have the

367
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,779
same pattern of traffic although of

368
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,100
course tours better than a VPN where you

369
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,010
basically just go to someone else's

370
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,050
computer and hop right back out so you

371
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,910
know we've done a lot of testing on this

372
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,829
mix that we have a full simulator and

373
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,199
what's really cool about mix Nets is

374
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:24,959
that even though they have a reputation

375
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,350
for being slow at this point we can

376
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,479
speed them up to get you know

377
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,980
milliseconds level delays and we can

378
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,079
basically start to knit for different

379
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,000
use cases so for example if you want to

380
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,130
send cryptocurrency through a mix net

381
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,920
you might want to be really private you

382
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:43,110
want to slow it down but if you want to

383
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,120
send like text messages encrypted

384
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,810
messages like signal kind of messages to

385
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,339
a mix that you might want to speed it up

386
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,949
but then you can mix these kinds of

387
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,779
distributions of traffic so that people

388
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,390
sending signal messages can provide

389
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:00,360
cover traffic for people using the mix

390
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:02,250
net and then of course the problem is

391
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,470
you know if you just open and mix that

392
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,750
this actually something Adam back told

393
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,709
me two years ago here he said well the

394
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,929
problem is you know I

395
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,299
Adam backs like people just flood it

396
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,790
with traffic and so that's why I add him

397
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:16,230
back basically programmed Hashcash the

398
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,379
proof-of-work algorithm we currently use

399
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,660
in and and Bitcoin and the reason was

400
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,549
that people are essentially flooding his

401
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,169
little mix net and he wanted to

402
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:27,209
basically make sure that they couldn't

403
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,679
just flood it for free so we said well

404
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,690
we would like something like that but

405
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,730
doesn't require proof of work so we

406
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,770
chose to look at the literature on

407
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,360
anonymous authentication credentials and

408
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,340
we use a new kind of anonymous

409
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,659
syndication credential based on what's

410
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,309
called the cocoanut signature scheme

411
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,260
which is too much to go into right now

412
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:45,990
but I'll just go over what it provides

413
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:48,330
which it provides decentralization so

414
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,130
it's like a blind signature but unlike

415
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,230
ordinary blind signatures you don't have

416
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,669
a single issuing authority that you're

417
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,520
dependent on it

418
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:59,540
of course it's anonymous it uses algum

419
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,940
all randomized double cryptography and

420
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,889
it's selective disclosure so rather than

421
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,720
like a full zk Stark or something which

422
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,940
lets you compute any program you're

423
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,460
essentially doing a large vector commit

424
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,820
on the credential and you blind that and

425
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,760
you can

426
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,649
reveal selectively using specialized

427
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,930
zero knowledge proves for private

428
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,180
attributes things that you may want to

429
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,500
reveal for example to a service part and

430
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,540
other end this could be something as

431
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,220
simple as I would like to send this

432
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,409
cryptocurrency transaction through this

433
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,750
is the domination this is the sender

434
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,120
this is the receiver to you know proof

435
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,280
that I'm a resident of the Czech

436
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,530
Republic or more more importantly I'm a

437
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,540
member of parallel pauline or whatever

438
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,980
it is that you need to get the operation

439
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,600
off the ground for example for a

440
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,030
messenger you might need to provide a

441
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,770
list of contacts and you can buy proof

442
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:50,490
of long term key ownership you can do

443
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:53,129
things like long term pseudonyms and so

444
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:56,520
this is our kind of overly complex

445
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,260
scheme but I do think it basically is

446
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,930
the only one that works everything over

447
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,360
here is linkable which is public

448
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:06,660
everything here is and black is

449
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,870
anonymous unlink Abel you basically get

450
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,150
some kind of credential you can take it

451
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,550
from any sort of blockchain we would

452
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,590
like to use Bitcoin but we need a smart

453
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,990
contract functionality isn't quite there

454
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,689
yet in Bitcoin but we hope you get it

455
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,070
soon then you can embed whatever

456
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,970
credential whatever information you want

457
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:30,810
that credential get it transformed into

458
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:32,190
this kind of credential which then says

459
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,379
yes I have

460
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,320
I'd like to access an privacy enhance

461
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,660
service send it through the mix net the

462
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,820
mix that does that timing and pattern

463
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,130
breaking that we discussed earlier and

464
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,080
it ships out and then you can see you

465
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,150
can basically anonymously use whatever

466
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,620
service provider you want and the

467
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,360
service provider then uses a little

468
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,340
custom blockchain not a cryptocurrency

469
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,580
because we only would like one

470
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,919
cryptocurrency ideally not create other

471
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,750
ones just kind of randomly here and we

472
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,880
just basically use that that we used

473
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,560
what's called the NIM blockchain just to

474
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,840
check to see if the credentials valid

475
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,000
and also to maintain operations kind of

476
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,070
information such as who's the mix then

477
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,560
what's the PKI of the mix net and this

478
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,360
sort of information and you know works

479
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:19,800
really fast in a few milliseconds so I'm

480
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,310
much faster than DK Starks odd on Z cash

481
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,830
and you know and that we this was this

482
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,510
Adam back really I really owe him

483
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,260
on this one because he really helped

484
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:31,879
inspire this concept where I was saying

485
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,090
well Adam if you know we were gonna redo

486
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,590
Bitcoin from the beginning what would

487
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,419
what could be done differently he said

488
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,639
well you know the problem with mining is

489
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,920
it does help maintain the economy and

490
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,890
that's great and it makes makes

491
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,230
everything stable but you know privacy

492
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,480
historically is really expensive

493
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,780
computationally and we don't have any

494
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,120
incentives to let people make

495
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,620
computation more private so he said it

496
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,689
wouldn't be great if there was some way

497
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,699
we could use all this computational

498
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,380
power and these incentive structures

499
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,930
that you know Nakamoto has taught us

500
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:08,420
through Bitcoin and use that to

501
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,580
basically fuel privacy enhancing

502
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,790
technologies and so that's kind of what

503
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,830
we've done actually we've basically

504
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:18,530
developed a sort of token scheme so that

505
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:22,100
we can get consensus for who's in the

506
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:24,590
mix net at any given time and we can

507
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,990
make sure that that makes that isn't is

508
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,639
evenly distributed it's not all in a

509
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,310
single jurisdiction so one of the main

510
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,320
problems that tor has is that most tor

511
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,000
users are in the United States they

512
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,620
would like to use Silicon Valley

513
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,900
services which are also in the United

514
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,429
States and most tor nodes are in Germany

515
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,380
so essentially you're bouncing users

516
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,940
from the u.s. to Germany back to the

517
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,200
United States well we would like to is

518
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,750
we like to actually make sure that the

519
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,610
network is global and resistant to state

520
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,220
repression so that's why we would like

521
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:55,340
to soar reward for example even a more

522
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,880
low capacity node in someplace like Hong

523
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,189
Kong or Indonesia or Malaysia more than

524
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,370
a high capacity node which is for

525
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,320
example in New York or Amsterdam and

526
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,090
then what we really want you wants to

527
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,250
know that's called like proof of mixing

528
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,899
rather than mining so we want these

529
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,840
rewards to be fair we want people who

530
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,120
are giving handing over machines in a

531
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,550
permissionless manner to form a mix that

532
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,929
to be rewarded for mixing this traffic

533
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,820
for basically getting these packets

534
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,160
holding them for a few seconds and

535
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,530
routing them to the next level and so we

536
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,930
call that mix mining and then you know

537
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,730
we would need to basically do what

538
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:34,360
Bitcoin does because what Bitcoin debt

539
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:37,700
debt does is successful it's proof

540
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,330
incentive systems work and so basically

541
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,529
we would

542
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,710
want to have some sort of ability to

543
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:46,100
take transaction fees to help pay for

544
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:48,019
the mix that over time and you know some

545
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,908
sort of fixed reward schedule so that

546
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:52,309
people who come in early get more

547
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:54,500
rewards than people that come in late

548
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:56,928
because it's more risky to run a mix

549
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,250
node in the early days that will be once

550
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:01,100
there's tons of traffic coming through

551
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,659
and lots of fees and the incentive

552
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,629
structures are pretty simple right so

553
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:08,750
users would like to have privacy and

554
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,700
anonymous access to services service

555
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,769
providers would like to be paid but you

556
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,980
know I used to run a VPN provider you

557
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:17,510
don't want to hold your users financial

558
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,179
data that's just a honeypot for law

559
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,908
enforcement so you would like to be paid

560
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:25,789
but ideally in a privacy enhanced

561
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:27,860
fashion and not holding user data mixed

562
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:30,408
nodes as I said earlier unlike tor

563
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,969
should be rewarded economically for

564
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:36,399
doing this work running the server

565
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:38,929
pushing out these packets and you know

566
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:41,149
validators should receive rewards for

567
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:43,010
maintaining the blocked sort of

568
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:44,719
blockchain which keeps the operations of

569
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,309
the credentials and this whole system

570
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,490
together and so you would need something

571
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:52,610
like credentials effectively to ensure

572
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:56,510
that fees are taken in a way that

573
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:59,120
doesn't reveal the identity of the user

574
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,710
so this is the algorithm that we've

575
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,739
thought up this is the first time I've

576
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:07,340
really talked about it what we do is we

577
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,539
do something kind of similar verifiable

578
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,199
random function essentially as a

579
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:15,408
signature like a digital signature but

580
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:18,169
without a message but we can sort of we

581
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:20,720
can collectively produce bytes and show

582
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:23,269
that those bytes are indeed random so in

583
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,899
the beginning of let's say an epoch a

584
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:29,299
period of time in our mix network you

585
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:31,699
basically run a very friable random

586
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:34,370
function that verifiable random function

587
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,470
is then produced as a random path

588
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,840
through the mix Network because again we

589
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,840
want to be fair an unbiased random path

590
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,449
and we do a commitment of that to the

591
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,789
blockchain once you've done this

592
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:49,789
commitment this commitment also chooses

593
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:51,590
randomly a user to send in through a

594
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:53,600
kind of measurement traffic this

595
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,600
we thought of as I think my friendly

596
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,480
Fricke put it a secret shopper someone

597
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,820
who's you know pretends to be a normal

598
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,590
packet but actually they're to decide if

599
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,340
someone's actually shipping packets

600
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,610
correctly or not

601
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,439
so because we use the Sphynx packet

602
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,120
format which is as nice also used a

603
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,850
lightning Network there's really nice

604
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,860
anonymous packet format the mix knows

605
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,559
themselves can't distinguish user

606
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,379
traffic from cover traffic from

607
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,970
essentially measurement traffic so they

608
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,710
can't tell if they're being rewarded or

609
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,590
not they're just getting packets and

610
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,659
shipping them and then every time one

611
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:32,270
nice thing the Sphynx packet form it has

612
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:33,919
it has a little nonce a little random

613
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,129
number you only use one so then you

614
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:41,450
don't use it again to basically tell if

615
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:43,370
a packet is being replayed or not but

616
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,840
what you can do is you can basically you

617
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,789
know locally on your mix though just do

618
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,740
every time you get a new packet in you

619
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:50,360
have to unwrap it anyways 2ky basically

620
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,520
get the next hop and you take that nonce

621
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:57,529
you do a commitment of that nonce to a

622
00:25:52,520 --> 00:26:01,190
Merkel tree there the end of the epoch

623
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:04,010
the time period the vrf that you

624
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:07,580
originally commit to is revealed and all

625
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:10,250
the mix those can say ah yes indeed I

626
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,168
did get that packet I did route it

627
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,120
correctly and if they reveal that they

628
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:15,409
got that the measurement packet and they

629
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,090
can reveal it prove that they got it

630
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:20,659
using that nonce commitment to the

631
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:22,100
Merkel tree then they get rewarded and

632
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:24,470
if you run enough of this measurement

633
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,678
traffic you can basically fairly

634
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:30,350
statistically sample an entire large mix

635
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,059
Network this measurement traffic is

636
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:35,059
basically just cover traffic for

637
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:37,428
whatever other kind of thing you're

638
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:39,590
sending through the network and this

639
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:43,010
basically lets us fairly reward nodes

640
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,649
and so we can reward mix nodes via the

641
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:48,289
store of mixed mining algorithm I put

642
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:50,299
out put forward and we want to reward

643
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:52,220
these validators for staying online so

644
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:53,750
we kind of measure them as well when you

645
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,210
want to create an honest credential you

646
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,950
ask the validators if you don't get one

647
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,600
then you can write it to the blockchain

648
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,429
who you're asked for and they can prove

649
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,219
that they either did give you one or not

650
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,290
and then sir's providers you know when

651
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,360
you go through sin

652
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,100
traffic to the mix node they collect

653
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,379
these credentials and the end of the

654
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:15,010
epoch thing and say yes I got this

655
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,660
credential now I can prove that I don't

656
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:21,129
know who access my service but my

657
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:23,080
service had 5,000 users or 6000 users or

658
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,480
6 users and they can also be rewarded

659
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:29,770
for provisioning privacy enhanced

660
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,690
services to these to these users users

661
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,639
can pay for these services using Bitcoin

662
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,130
or whatever other cryptocurrency they

663
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,950
like and they can just pay a small fee

664
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:42,580
to go through the mix network and I

665
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:45,960
think that's priceless so this this was

666
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:49,629
a this scheme was discussed very briefly

667
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,160
with Julian Assange himself me and Jorge

668
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:55,000
aneesa's went to visit him right before

669
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:58,420
his guest list was cut off and we said

670
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,790
you know mix that sir clearly the future

671
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,070
and blockchains are clearly the future

672
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:05,370
and we really need to sort of pivot away

673
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:07,960
from these sort of government-funded

674
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:10,239
voluntary based systems like tor and

675
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,060
build a kind of anonymous and on me

676
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,590
system which is self-sustaining

677
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,330
self-funded and uses incentive

678
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,090
structures and crypto economics to

679
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:22,149
become really resilient to attack and

680
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:24,360
you know he agreed but unfortunately

681
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:27,580
it's no longer with us I would recommend

682
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,159
people buy the coins and be in

683
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:33,720
solidarity with him there was a Julian

684
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,580
Assange solidarity coins outside I think

685
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,070
and people should not forget his case I

686
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,870
think his case is a real litmus test if

687
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:43,090
someone is actually a crypto anarchist

688
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:45,399
or not a lot of people don't support him

689
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,810
for whatever reason but I think anyone

690
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,850
under repression who's done the work

691
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,770
that he's done needs kind of needs

692
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,570
support and we just were hoping to

693
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,910
create the sort of technology again in

694
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,770
his honor and the honor Tim Timothy may

695
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,090
and other people have come before us and

696
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:02,460
then what we're trying to figure out

697
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:06,100
which we're still working on is how much

698
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:08,110
the fundamental kind of denomination of

699
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,240
this system should be I mean it would be

700
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:12,699
nice to use Bitcoin but I'm not Julian

701
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,710
Assange I don't have tons of Bitcoin to

702
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,870
sort of bootstrap a fixed supply to get

703
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,850
the system working so we said well you

704
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,178
know we kind of want essentially the

705
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,748
Syst

706
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:24,159
to be something logical so whatever the

707
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:26,499
fundament denomination should be it

708
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,419
should be basically use of the mix net

709
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:31,059
for about one day whatever that's worth

710
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:32,589
which is probably we hope some something

711
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:35,369
is fairly small because we want lots of

712
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:37,629
users so something around like one penny

713
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:39,820
and then you know we can take these fees

714
00:29:37,629 --> 00:29:42,849
out and feed it back into the system so

715
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:45,070
that and even hold some fees out in

716
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:47,349
order to feed the system when there's a

717
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,908
tax and when there's a lack of users and

718
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:52,139
when there's denial of service attacks

719
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:56,080
so that the mix no network is basically

720
00:29:52,139 --> 00:30:00,399
continually growing even with a fixed

721
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,710
supply of rewards and I just want to say

722
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,799
that there's lots of neat applications

723
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:09,369
for this system and I'm just gonna bring

724
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:11,609
up one so unfortunately my my my kind of

725
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:14,080
co-founder Jorge Denise's was uh

726
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:16,599
acquired by Facebook and went over to

727
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,279
work on the Libre we do believe he'll

728
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,139
come back someday because no one the

729
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:24,070
right mine would work on a Libre for

730
00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:27,609
very long but the Libre really is a big

731
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:30,999
threat and you know it will Colette use

732
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:33,428
the mass of our personal data basically

733
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:35,589
created by Facebook Connect that's

734
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:40,570
harvested by Facebook and use that for

735
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:42,820
massive kyc AML will be the kind of

736
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,950
legal reason but basically use this to

737
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:48,039
attempt to identify every cryptocurrency

738
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,570
transaction so we think it's time to get

739
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:52,059
this technology going because it really

740
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:55,468
is do-or-die time we either will have

741
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:59,649
pseudonymous and anonymous key based

742
00:30:55,469 --> 00:31:01,719
private transactions or and we need to

743
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:04,748
basically make sure Bitcoin can support

744
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:06,460
this or Libre will take over the world

745
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:09,639
and we do think that this kind of

746
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:13,269
technology is essentially the the only

747
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:14,949
and I think last best bet we have

748
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:17,649
against the Libre but I think that I

749
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:21,519
think the question we have is how is it

750
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:23,768
that we can build better anonymity on

751
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,700
top of Bitcoin because that's actually

752
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:27,609
what we would like to do with this

753
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:30,849
system and I think the solution is the

754
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:32,080
Lightning Network so one of the problems

755
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:34,899
with the Lightning Network

756
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,428
who here I assume every here's familial

757
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:39,610
Lightning Network but there's two big

758
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:41,440
problems one problem which we I'm not

759
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,360
really quite sure to solve is you know

760
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,100
we create these payment channels you

761
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,779
need to have the sort of hot wallet and

762
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,000
no one really likes keeping their hot

763
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:53,529
wallet online all the time because

764
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,590
someone might hack it I mean I

765
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:58,630
definitely don't but there's another

766
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,850
problem which is at least for you know

767
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,559
public channels I mean there are private

768
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,629
channels we don't know about but for

769
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,908
public channels you know the list of

770
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:09,130
channels is basically public and anyone

771
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:11,590
this is a visualization of them can

772
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,419
basically monitor all the open channels

773
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,519
and all the paths through the Lightning

774
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:17,230
Network and and that's dangerous

775
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,440
actually what we would like to do is we

776
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:23,500
would like to use this mixed network to

777
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,990
basically form a privacy enhanced

778
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,350
backbone to the Lightning Network and

779
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:31,059
that's actually really easy because the

780
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:33,760
Lightning network already uses the

781
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:36,549
Sphynx packet format which my former co

782
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,190
founder George denise's invented for

783
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:41,470
mixed networking so it's really a simple

784
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,990
matter of basically letting those

785
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:45,490
channels have multiple hops through a

786
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,980
mixed network and you can anonymize

787
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,750
who's got the open payment channel to

788
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,909
whom which I guess makes it a little bit

789
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,919
harder at least to figure out who's hot

790
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:57,070
wallet I should try to hack and so we

791
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,620
think that could be a really killer use

792
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:02,710
case of the sort of anonymous credential

793
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:05,979
mix net based technology this is the

794
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:08,710
current team unfortunately I'm the only

795
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,210
one here but do you feel free to get in

796
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,600
touch with anyone I am very proud of

797
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,669
Dave who left Facebook Libre to work on

798
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,350
this project so I think that they we do

799
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:21,159
have this law of commitment from people

800
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:23,010
and there was a lot of Technology and I

801
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:25,779
went through it very quickly so I

802
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:29,919
honestly don't expect that explanation

803
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:32,799
b2b very good it was but if you want a

804
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,419
better explanation you can go to all

805
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,250
these wonderful papers which we've been

806
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:38,590
writing for last few years and you can

807
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,770
look at for example anya who works with

808
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:43,449
us built the loop picks on every system

809
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:45,010
which is the kind of non incentivized

810
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,820
mix that that we're using that does the

811
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,400
stop-and-go

812
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,929
this mixing the coconut signature scheme

813
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,180
George Denis is built which is what how

814
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:54,880
we've got anonymous credentials to be

815
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,610
decentralized and various proof of stake

816
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,090
and anonyme work that I've been working

817
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:04,090
on as well so I just like to say that

818
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,510
there is hope right we we have these

819
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:11,319
kinds of technologies which have been

820
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:12,639
germinating since the early 90s they're

821
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,050
really dawn of the Crypt anarchist

822
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,830
movement and we just need to basically

823
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:19,540
go full steam ahead and get them out

824
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:22,929
there and working and connect them to

825
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:25,270
the actual things that we value and care

826
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:27,219
for and use our daily basis such as

827
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,429
Bitcoin the Lightning Network and that

828
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:31,540
if we're really in a race against time

829
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:33,699
against Facebook Libre and if not

830
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,380
Facebook Libre the Chinese government's

831
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,759
cryptocurrency or the American

832
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,720
government's cryptocurrency or whatever

833
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:44,020
other new sinister totalitarian kind of

834
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:46,449
system controls coming up next but again

835
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,570
there's reasons to be there is no need

836
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:52,179
for hope no need for fear and as Geo's

837
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:55,030
Toulouse put it the only thing is to

838
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:58,960
look for new weapons and we're going to

839
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:01,960
release all the code and a description

840
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,880
of everything on of course the 5th of

841
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,360
November because what better data do so

842
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:09,310
and you can look at the current state of

843
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,540
development and you can download the

844
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,190
mixed ed and run it and some other

845
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,230
another parts of it although it's not

846
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:18,160
fully integrated yet by going to our

847
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:21,650
website there so that's it if there's

848
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,810
any questions I'd be happy to take them

849
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,070
[Applause]

850
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,070
[Music]

851
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:34,990
okay thank you for sharing with us I see

852
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:40,420
right hand and I see here okay we have a

853
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:41,709
few questions thank you very much for an

854
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,900
enlightening talk

855
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,150
I wanted to ask you a bit more detail

856
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:50,050
like you really think that Libra is a

857
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:53,010
threat like the decentralized crypto

858
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:56,410
could really kill Bitcoin and if so how

859
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:59,020
how would that look yes I think it's

860
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,670
fairly straightforward so unfortunately

861
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,790
the problem is there's a lot of people

862
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:05,410
out there who aren't politically aware

863
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,480
people will just think they already use

864
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,520
Facebook they'll use facebook messenger

865
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,160
they'll use whatsapp whatsapp in

866
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,920
particular covers you know as Preston

867
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,899
Bern printed one you know 1/4 1/3 of the

868
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,150
sentiment human life on this planet and

869
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:22,990
they will use that for for monetary

870
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:27,790
transfers and the problem with that is

871
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:30,939
that will normalize the sort of process

872
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:33,190
of total identification that Facebook

873
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,780
will require through the calibra wallet

874
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:38,319
and they've said they'll require this in

875
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:41,680
order to use the Libra and as more

876
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:46,569
people as if their first experience of

877
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:54,609
digital currency is essentially a kind

878
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:55,900
of I don't know personal data you know

879
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:57,910
giving all their personal data in the

880
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,790
Mark Zuckerberg and his other lizard

881
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:02,290
human friends then they'll become used

882
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,750
to it they'll it'll become normalized

883
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,690
and the kind of freedom that we

884
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,670
experience with Bitcoin of using

885
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,800
pseudonymous keys will will become a

886
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:15,849
relic of the past and then what will be

887
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:19,810
worse will be what could happen is what

888
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:21,310
Amir taki said and a very good very I

889
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:23,410
think it's called coders to code as a

890
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,509
weapon a very good blog post on coin

891
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,490
desk where he said the danger that we

892
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,410
face with libras that could fragment

893
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:31,598
cryptocurrencies so that all of the

894
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:34,060
legal uses a cryptocurrency all the

895
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,620
approved uses a cryptocurrency happened

896
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:38,450
through the Libra and all an

897
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,529
when it seems that the only use for

898
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:44,450
Bitcoin is things which are you know

899
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,430
black markets financing terrorism and

900
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:48,560
then that gives the government's excuse

901
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,690
to crack down even harder on Bitcoin

902
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,549
than they're doing today I think that's

903
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:55,370
really dangerous and so we need to have

904
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:57,050
both resilience and better privacy

905
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:59,509
within Bitcoin and all these great

906
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:01,100
usability Bitcoin stuff I'm not really

907
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,550
working on all those need to get out the

908
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:12,020
door really fast

909
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:14,510
next I hi great talk thank you if I

910
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:17,270
understand correctly your intention was

911
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:20,540
to build NIMH on top of the Bitcoin

912
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:23,560
network but currently Bitcoin doesn't it

913
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:25,730
doesn't quite have the smart contract

914
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,500
capabilities due to the limitations of

915
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,320
the scripting language so maybe you

916
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,850
could touch on that a little bit more

917
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,060
when do you foresee that problem being

918
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:38,299
resolved and could it possibly be an

919
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,980
insurmountable problem and if so then

920
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,500
what no I don't think it's

921
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,790
insurmountable in fact you know things

922
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,190
like storage signatures are finally

923
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:49,360
coming online taproot is very

924
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:52,070
interesting and I I do think that

925
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,050
although it's and then you'll see this

926
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,810
on our current code base Oh though we

927
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:58,730
don't have it working natively with

928
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,470
Bitcoin we do believe it will be capable

929
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:02,900
than the same and within the short term

930
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,850
it really depends on how quickly the

931
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,650
Bitcoin kind of the Bitcoin core

932
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:09,440
developers and block stream everything

933
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:12,350
everyone can not all it can really push

934
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,610
out exactly those two things I need is

935
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,230
kind of a minimum you really do need

936
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:17,120
store seizures in taproot and that you

937
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,830
know we I have a lot of respect for

938
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,620
Peter a lot of respect for those people

939
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:23,690
working on them I I hope it's out there

940
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,759
before we launch because it would be bad

941
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,650
if it wasn't if not you know we'll just

942
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,600
keep working lightning but we can't get

943
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:31,370
really the full functionality until

944
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,380
taproot is nor it ideally some other

945
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:36,500
features or add to Bitcoin in simplicity

946
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,660
which is this kind of nice verified

947
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,270
smart contract language built for

948
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:43,100
Bitcoin by Russell O'Connor from block

949
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,110
stream I reviewed it it's very good I

950
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,490
really want to see that pushing as well

951
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,980
because then we can really enable all

952
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:50,319
sorts of very complex payment because

953
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,020
you see that you know if you haven't

954
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,790
no do you have services you do need to

955
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,890
have the kind of fees taken out on top

956
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:58,990
of Bitcoin fees and and it would be

957
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:01,299
really nice to do that on a sort of

958
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,799
smart contract on top of the Bitcoin

959
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,960
blockchain I do know those people are

960
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,990
getting very close to finish but also

961
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,790
they said that last year so I'm hoping

962
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:13,750
this year or next year is the real year

963
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:16,060
it gets done 2020 that's okay if you

964
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:20,520
have a three more questions here one two

965
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:23,080
three and but study here thanks Harry

966
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,330
can you share any ideas on how you can

967
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,640
run a mix node or a tor node if you

968
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:29,529
don't want to attract attention and get

969
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,379
the police knocking on your door and so

970
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:33,910
on yeah so it's actually it really

971
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,550
depends on what jurisdiction you're in

972
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,440
so the United States is a horrible

973
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:41,830
jurisdiction for many for many things is

974
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,500
actually good jurisdiction to run tor

975
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:46,000
nodes in and mix nodes in because you

976
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,190
know there's been rulings that basically

977
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,960
say just as your internet service

978
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:53,020
provider is not liable for you

979
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,280
downloading porn you are not liable to

980
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,990
running a node particular if it's

981
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,150
encrypted in all the traffic lists in

982
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:01,140
this indistinguishable for just passing

983
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:03,540
traffic from one node to another node

984
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:06,339
that's a lack of intermediary

985
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,630
intermediary liability so well-known

986
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,120
principle and American law unfortunately

987
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,610
other countries I in particular Europe

988
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,049
and in particular particular Germany

989
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,430
some mice don't see it that way

990
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:17,470
and that's why we have the really

991
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,899
unfortunate thing where more moritz who

992
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:23,500
was working with us on mix networking

993
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:26,080
but also tor servers dotnet running

994
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:29,560
aloft or exit nodes had as house raided

995
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,700
by the Bavarian police last year so I

996
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,610
really think you got choose your

997
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,649
jurisdiction really carefully a lot of

998
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:38,230
jurisdictions have larger problems then

999
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:39,850
tor exit nodes and entry nodes the

1000
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,020
middle notes gonna be pretty safe to run

1001
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:43,540
because no one really knows what's going

1002
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,800
in and out it's really the exits to

1003
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,950
entries that really get hammered

1004
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,070
particularly the exit nodes and I do

1005
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:54,549
think that a lot this is a thesis from a

1006
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:56,310
mirror but Amir believes a lot of dark

1007
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,420
markets are being shut down right now

1008
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,460
that's why you're not seeing too many

1009
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,510
new Silk Roads right now is because all

1010
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:05,090
these correlation attacks

1011
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,310
funded by DARPA and Carnegie Mellon etc

1012
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:10,610
etc on the Tor network that's probably

1013
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:12,950
true in which case the mix no mix

1014
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:16,130
networking would provide better defense

1015
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:20,450
against these kinds of attacks and you

1016
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:21,710
know finally I think you know what the

1017
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,410
real reason to have an incentive

1018
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:26,840
structure on top of a mix network is

1019
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,819
that there is no incentive structure to

1020
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,610
run a tor node besides kind of feeling

1021
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,170
you know part of a community helping the

1022
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,360
world helping fight for privacy and I

1023
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,680
believe in all those things too but I

1024
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,140
would really like for someone to pay my

1025
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,359
court bills when the police come and if

1026
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,920
and I think one thing is that if you're

1027
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,230
running a mix node we would like our

1028
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,440
system through Bitcoin fees or however

1029
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:51,050
we do it to basically give you it should

1030
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,120
be very lucrative to run an exit node or

1031
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,520
keep all the traffic inside the mix

1032
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,799
network so that you can pay your fees if

1033
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,290
there is any legal problems I think

1034
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,700
that's really the long-term solution to

1035
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,320
that problem at least before the

1036
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,450
collapse and destruction of the

1037
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:13,070
nation-state then won't be a problem

1038
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:14,720
anymore I just want to extend this

1039
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:17,240
question like what is the current status

1040
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,250
of the project like when do you expect

1041
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,859
that we can really like download the

1042
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:24,950
node install it and get at least like

1043
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:26,810
the same profit that the server housing

1044
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,600
cost yeah

1045
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:31,460
so we are currently working out the

1046
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,290
crypto economics to make sure that you

1047
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,670
know everyone can make a profit but if

1048
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,040
you want to run a node without profit

1049
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,410
you can do it today just go to the

1050
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,630
website there's a link to the github you

1051
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:43,910
can download the mix node code there it

1052
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:46,700
is all and go we would like to recode it

1053
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:49,009
and Russ to try to C++ to get things to

1054
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,980
be faster but we thought for version one

1055
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:54,080
pushing it out quicker was better than

1056
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,970
getting it perfect so you can download

1057
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,130
and run a note today and we have some

1058
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:59,569
demos that I think we even have some of

1059
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,340
it docker eyes that's pretty easy to

1060
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:04,250
test that being said I wouldn't

1061
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,320
recommend using it because the there are

1062
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,720
two things that you would need to use it

1063
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:11,570
besides just financial reward and that's

1064
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,640
you need to know how long to hold the

1065
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,450
traffic before passing it on words and

1066
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,470
how much cover traffic

1067
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:20,279
to produce that these are called

1068
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:21,779
parameters these are an enable you can

1069
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,400
basically look at your traffic and

1070
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,610
figure out those kinds of parameters and

1071
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,200
that software we do have working but we

1072
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:30,000
don't have it working dynamically so can

1073
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,460
dynamically reconfigure those parameters

1074
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,800
so we're trying to get that working

1075
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:37,980
ideally as soon as possible I wouldn't

1076
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,050
recommend anyone use it for real

1077
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:43,560
anonymous stuff until we get that

1078
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:45,420
working I think okay Thank You Tommy and

1079
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:50,820
I see you again don't worry you will get

1080
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:53,280
it last night

1081
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,660
if you would like to run a mix node we

1082
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,010
are gonna be beta testing if you go to

1083
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,710
the web page you go down the bottom of

1084
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:00,540
web page it says sign up for to be a run

1085
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:03,420
a node just write your email in there

1086
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:05,100
we'll send you an email you know when

1087
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,520
when you're ready it does cost about a

1088
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,049
thousand dollars a month on average to

1089
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,400
run a tor node by thinking countries

1090
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,900
like Prague and stuff is going to be

1091
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,100
considerably cheaper just a few hundred

1092
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:18,720
maybe less so regarding the name token

1093
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,180
how do you foresee like the initial

1094
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,790
distribution and how would you like to

1095
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,160
like control the price if you say like

1096
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:29,820
the token should be valued at something

1097
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,620
like one day worth of like yeah I mean I

1098
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,630
mean one of their markets is you can't

1099
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:35,640
control the price and a lot of the

1100
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,770
pricing would depend on how much Bitcoin

1101
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:40,620
and other transactions come through the

1102
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:43,950
system and how much crazy whatever crazy

1103
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,870
stuff speculators do so that's kind of

1104
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,790
what we're trying to work out now by

1105
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:51,540
basically writing lots of simulations to

1106
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:54,240
understand how we can make sure there

1107
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,580
isn't like a mojo nation kind of deaths

1108
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,750
inflation deflationary death spiral and

1109
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,490
how we can really get some of the

1110
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,590
tributes that we saw with Bitcoin which

1111
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:06,060
is to be honest at this point relative

1112
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:09,240
price stability and a little bit of

1113
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:11,640
resistance to to trivial market

1114
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:14,490
manipulation so I think those are kind

1115
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,290
of open questions we will do our best to

1116
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:22,049
answer those and that's why we're not

1117
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:22,560
launching the system today so ok one

1118
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:26,670
more question

1119
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,990
are you planning in I feel for this name

1120
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:31,630
token yeah now that was what everyone

1121
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:33,459
disgusting two years ago and I think

1122
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,660
unfortunately those are kind of out of

1123
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,750
fashion right now

1124
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,879
Soho so we're we are trying to figure

1125
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:42,280
out how to do it uh there will be an

1126
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,560
announcement on November 5th we haven't

1127
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,750
determined yet I think like essentially

1128
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,720
the best thing to do would be to fund

1129
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:51,580
the beginning through some sort of you

1130
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,810
know we had a massively rich sponsor

1131
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,650
that would throw down that would be

1132
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,230
great

1133
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:59,290
until then we have to figure out some

1134
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:02,080
way to basically fairly gather the the

1135
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:04,240
rewards up and so you know I won't I

1136
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,590
wouldn't I wouldn't put any kind of

1137
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,229
distribution mechanism totally

1138
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:10,270
off-limits right now but if you are a

1139
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:16,360
giant Bitcoin whale we would be more

1140
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:18,690
than happy to talk so okay so we have we

1141
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:22,869
have we can do like one more question so

1142
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:25,750
anybody in the audience did a question

1143
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:26,230
no okay so now I'll see I see oh no

1144
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,660
question

1145
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,510
okay thank you hurry thank you thank you

1146
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:35,439
for celebrating toad and sharing with us

1147
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:35,439
[Applause]

1148
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:40,990
I would like to just have just a quick

1149
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:44,660
note I don't know if you noticed but

1150
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:46,640
outside like behind the foot stage there

1151
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,680
is of a concept called Essen track I

1152
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,960
don't know if you have a moment to see

1153
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,029
the track or to visit the place

1154
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,160
definitely found to find the moment

1155
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,470
actually there's the our last project

1156
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,000
and we are still looking for support and

1157
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:02,270
to people who would like to for example

1158
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,790
host to this track on your event next

1159
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:06,710
year so definitely go and check the

1160
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:09,560
track and think of how can you use it

1161
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:13,780
within the sharing the ideas and concept

1162
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,779
we are building together thank you
