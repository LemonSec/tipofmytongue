the great pleasure to announce the

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:39,440
world's first Bitcoin barkeeper the man

5
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,390
who has been accepting or who owns a the

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,699
first brick-and-mortar store in Berlin

7
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:53,540
that the longest accepting Bitcoin place

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:55,730
in the world room 77 then who has shaped

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,800
the especially Bitcoin ecosphere

10
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,370
significantly he wrote the first book

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,500
about Bitcoin in German he made the

12
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:07,610
first lightning Network transaction in

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,590
exchange for a real life good yeah true

14
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,360
Bitcoin pure

15
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,420
let's see how he's gonna talk about a

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,770
death of Bitcoin in slow and interweb

17
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,960
I forgot the titles the inevitable and

18
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:24,560
awful end of the grant Bitcoin

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,720
experiment and what comes after so make

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:35,360
round of applause for your plot sir

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:38,060
thank you thanks for coming in the the

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,280
click page title seems to have been

23
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:44,810
working but no where is everybody who

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,560
fell for it I have some kind of

25
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:52,729
satisfaction for you so this talk is

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:56,390
about it has an official part and it has

27
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:59,240
a part about stuff that concerns me and

28
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,580
before I start when I wrote my notes

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,548
together for this talk it reminded me of

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:09,500
another talk that two people held like

31
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:11,600
15 years ago on a Kaos Congress and I'm

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,579
looking into the audience now if I see

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,880
Frank because he was one of the two guys

34
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:21,910
who held that talk Frank is not here

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:26,450
anyway I'm talking frankly go not wrong

36
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:28,700
no Frank in the house how is he all

37
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:35,030
right there he's hiding that talk was

38
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:38,010
about did we lose the war about privacy

39
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,830
this was like 15 years ago

40
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,420
because when I made my notes I somehow

41
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,819
remember that talk and I looked it up

42
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,010
and then you guys had a problem there

43
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,619
actually with your talk and that was the

44
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,590
we and they think so I want I'm going to

45
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,480
use the words we and the words a in my

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,940
talk so I want to define them first when

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:02,040
I've been so in this talk when I say we

48
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:04,859
I mean the early enthusiastic Bitcoin

49
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,880
community all these people who when

50
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,290
Bitcoin turned up freaked out and were

51
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,940
like this is it I'm gonna jump on this

52
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:21,149
and when I talk about they or them I

53
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:23,849
mean the authoritarian state apparatus

54
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,290
that is ruling us that includes banks

55
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,339
central banks governments and

56
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:33,660
corporations so just to make that clear

57
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:37,290
I was very often asked and I needed to

58
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:40,140
find an answer for myself why is there

59
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:44,660
why has there been a certain group of

60
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:47,250
people who instantly spontaneously

61
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:53,790
jumped onto Bitcoin when they first saw

62
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:55,799
it and I came to a conclusion oh there

63
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,420
were people who completely freaked out

64
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,959
and say that it's the best thing I saw

65
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,790
in my life and then there's other people

66
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,920
who ten years after bitcoins inception

67
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,078
still go like what the hell is all this

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,048
about so I came to the conclusion this

69
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,670
is just to define the the us or we a

70
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,730
little closer I came to the conclusion

71
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,950
that it took like three things that one

72
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,978
should man must have been aware of if

73
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:22,729
one became really enthusiastic when

74
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:26,400
hearing about Bitcoin for the first time

75
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:29,250
the first one is the belief that we need

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,760
a new monetary system a new money better

77
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,400
money

78
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:39,419
what Austrian economics call sound money

79
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,070
/ and freedom of transaction so if you

80
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,659
would not have any understanding for

81
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,940
that then Bitcoin doesn't make any sense

82
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,159
if you think euro and fiat currency and

83
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,960
dollar and so on is a great stuff it's a

84
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:50,669
great thing then Bitcoin doesn't make

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,060
any sense in the first place the second

86
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,080
thing

87
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,540
wouldn't have to have understood is

88
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,669
cryptography a symmetric cryptography

89
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:02,670
public key cryptography - and to be able

90
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:07,250
to understand that the Bitcoin protocol

91
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:12,180
can actually fulfill that sound money

92
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:16,050
ideal and the third thing one would have

93
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,590
needed to understand in order to know

94
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:23,220
why bitcoin is going to be that sound

95
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,869
money and no other coin is is a little

96
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,060
understanding about the history of

97
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:34,970
software development and the difference

98
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:38,870
between product and protocol I actually

99
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:42,240
found a great quote by Ross Ulbricht

100
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,320
only two days ago that I just want to

101
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,250
throw in here because it's so beautiful

102
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,710
and that explains that again quote

103
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,840
bitcoin was birthed on two fertile

104
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,659
ground and was recognized by those that

105
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,200
had been waiting for it that's these

106
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,970
people who had kind of understood this

107
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,920
this was an historic moment for them far

108
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,290
more important and pizzas or electric

109
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,500
bills run up from mining the promise of

110
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,060
freedom and the allure of Destiny

111
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,790
energized the early community Bitcoin

112
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,100
was consciously yet spontaneously taken

113
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:18,170
up as money while no one was watching

114
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,170
and our world will never be the same

115
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,380
he actually deserves an applause for

116
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:28,740
that but don't interrupt my don't

117
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:31,950
interrupt by so obviously about a decade

118
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:36,900
ago this bunch of people who had been

119
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:42,450
waiting for the inception of digital

120
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:44,969
cash look at the Bitcoin protocol

121
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,729
freaked out and was like that's it and

122
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,040
these people I'm one of them and I have

123
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:54,330
to say when I say we I say that with a

124
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,280
lot of pride but I'm not Satoshi I'm not

125
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,729
a developer I'm not one of these

126
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,989
geniuses who actually built the stuff I

127
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,930
contribute what I can contribute and

128
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:08,130
that was like talking

129
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:13,949
and public relations and and stuff like

130
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:18,930
that but yeah this group of people was

131
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:21,630
kinda naive enough to think that we

132
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:25,380
create the first digital bearer as it

133
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:27,870
the first thing in the information age

134
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:33,690
in the digital world that can be held by

135
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:36,300
an individual that cannot be copied and

136
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:39,270
I put my emphasis here on the word

137
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:44,729
digital cash which I want to define

138
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:49,020
again because most people make the

139
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:51,690
mistake to think that cash must

140
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:58,349
necessarily be notes and coins and

141
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:59,460
anything digital cannot be cash it's the

142
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:02,610
other way around

143
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,948
I believe cash can be defined by certain

144
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,110
properties it must be able to be

145
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:09,320
transferred without a middleman the

146
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,300
recipient can verify the transaction

147
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:15,050
immediately on the spot transactions are

148
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,280
final and cannot be reversed

149
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,280
there also means they cannot be

150
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,109
confiscated by anyone and the identities

151
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,520
of the sender and the receiver are not

152
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:31,050
necessary to fulfill the transaction so

153
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,419
again ten years ago

154
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:37,190
there's naive group and I remember the

155
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,779
first years I believe the most important

156
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,510
property you needed to have if you were

157
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:46,439
a Bitcoin enthusiast up until like five

158
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:49,770
years ago was the capability to be

159
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,930
laughed at was to be okay with the

160
00:08:49,770 --> 00:09:00,180
people making making a fool out of you

161
00:08:51,930 --> 00:09:01,859
already killing you but and hence the

162
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,250
title of the talk that's not here

163
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,180
anymore

164
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:10,410
anyway ten years later we can actually

165
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,930
say we did it we have I think big

166
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,990
Bitcoin is around the 10th biggest money

167
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,880
by buying power there's like ten state

168
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,940
currency still that that in

169
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,520
in which more buying power is stored

170
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,140
than then in Bitcoin Bitcoin is bigger

171
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,140
now than the Canadian dollar or the

172
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,720
Australian dollar maybe it's in the tip

173
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,500
right now we are on spot number 12 or

174
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,590
something like that we had a network

175
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,050
uptime from something like 99.9999%

176
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:43,020
years some people here can give you an

177
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,750
actually more exact number we have

178
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,910
thousands of copycats that try to kind

179
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,860
of get market share that actually got

180
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,709
some market share but when people kind

181
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:57,270
of woke up it looks like the whole thing

182
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:59,250
is reversing again we have banks

183
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:04,920
government central banks corporations

184
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:06,690
all want to copy that success they

185
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,490
either want to copy that success by

186
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:15,140
creating their own coin somehow or they

187
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:18,090
want to be part of that success by by

188
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,340
trying to join the movement like you

189
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,070
have bankers now wearing wearing black

190
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,650
hoodies coming to hackers conferences

191
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,920
and talking about how they are going to

192
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,480
disrupt the world with their Bitcoin

193
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,819
bank account that they're going to offer

194
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,199
you and so on

195
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,199
[Music]

196
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:47,090
let me make a little diversion here the

197
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:50,160
companies that claim that is a good idea

198
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:55,560
for you to store their bit your Bitcoin

199
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,750
on their website and to give the tasks

200
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,079
to them to receive transactions for you

201
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,940
and to send transactions for you

202
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:08,220
they really very strongly remind me of a

203
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:11,970
scene in the Bible that scene is you

204
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,070
might remember the only moment in the

205
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,880
New Testament when Jesus Christ gets

206
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,580
violent

207
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,280
does anybody you remember there's one

208
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,350
person another one so that was when

209
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,730
Jesus came into the temple of Jerusalem

210
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,550
and saw the money changers and and

211
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,949
and moneylenders and he literally turned

212
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,949
violent and threw over their tables and

213
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:35,899
he had to be thrown out by security out

214
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:39,469
of the temple and so on so you're like

215
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:41,389
oh well that's kind of interesting the

216
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,029
situation was that people actually had

217
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:46,430
sound money they had I don't know what

218
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:49,279
kind of Palestinian money they had Roman

219
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:52,550
Denarius which at the time was actual

220
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,560
sound money like far beyond 90% silver

221
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:58,519
it took them four hundred years to

222
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,979
inflate that away so people had actually

223
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,440
sound money for trade but at the temple

224
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,560
where you had to pay your tax you first

225
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,970
had to buy the temple money a certain

226
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,160
kind of coin and the people who had who

227
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,920
sold you this temple coin for your sound

228
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,510
money of course took their cut today had

229
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,389
monopolies and so on and so on that's

230
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:28,160
what Jesus Christ got so pissed off

231
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:30,889
about so another point is I believe we

232
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,060
can say that bitcoin is digital gold -

233
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:40,069
Gold - dot o or a safe haven for the

234
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:43,099
recession to come has been recognized

235
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:46,389
and established even by hedge fund

236
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,889
managers and and by the banking world

237
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,690
you can see that you can see that in the

238
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:55,029
news you can read it online but I can

239
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:59,149
tell you that that also from one to one

240
00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:02,240
talks with people from with bankers with

241
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:05,000
central bankers with politicians with

242
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,899
law enforcement and I had these talks

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:14,089
over the last decade a lot of them I can

244
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:16,160
tell you one thing everybody from their

245
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:19,670
site please remember my definition

246
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,209
everybody from the airside who has the

247
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:25,729
task in their organization to deal with

248
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:28,518
Bitcoin to somehow try to get it under

249
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,709
control to find mean people who sold

250
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,930
Mariana on black markets and so on and

251
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,989
so on every banker every law enforcement

252
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,579
every central banker every politician

253
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:42,080
who

254
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:45,140
understands Bitcoin also has Bitcoin and

255
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,580
I found it out in so many personal talks

256
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,050
and discussions and I find it like

257
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,420
really interesting I think there is this

258
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:53,479
beautiful troy and horse function of

259
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:56,329
Bitcoin because you have organizations

260
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,200
that are threatened by Bitcoin obviously

261
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:03,110
but the people working inside these

262
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:06,290
organizations and have the task to deal

263
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,540
with this threat quickly understand why

264
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,490
bitcoin is actually a threat I was

265
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,380
talking to one financial regulator and I

266
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,300
found out like he has Bitcoin because he

267
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,100
told me he bought this or that sort for

268
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,870
his online game I was like oh you

269
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,390
actually hold Bitcoin his ends I was

270
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:25,010
literally I'm not a fool you know so

271
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,140
that's the official part where I would

272
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,720
go like oh let me yeah what does it mean

273
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,870
the end of the experiment of Bitcoin for

274
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,570
so many years we have called Bitcoin an

275
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,220
experiment and I would this is the

276
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,340
official part I would herewith declare

277
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,910
the end of Bitcoin the experiment and

278
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:47,220
announce Bitcoin their reality as an

279
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:54,520
established fact of our world I

280
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:56,660
[Applause]

281
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,600
thank you very much

282
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,250
I really think bitcoin is not going to

283
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,810
go anywhere I think it's quite obviously

284
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,640
Bitcoin is not going to go anywhere

285
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,530
anymore and since it's not going to go

286
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,500
anywhere anymore

287
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:12,439
and because of its properties as sound

288
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,960
money as literally the hardest money

289
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,320
ever built we had only this week

290
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,930
Bavarian landis bank blah blah blah

291
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,940
created somebody's nodding so was it

292
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,069
some kind of specialist some kind of

293
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,990
currency specialist from banks and they

294
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,990
actually came to the conclusion bitcoin

295
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,690
is the ultimate hard money and what we

296
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,280
know what all of history tells us is

297
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,460
that the harder money will always

298
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,339
replace the weaker money so if bitcoin

299
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,940
is not going away any more we know where

300
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:46,610
it's going to go so this is basically

301
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:53,780
the moment where we could go like hey we

302
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:55,400
won the war but we can what we can say

303
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,290
for sure is that we want technologically

304
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,750
we built the sound money the sound money

305
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,300
is there and it cannot be taken away

306
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,770
that means the weak money has to compete

307
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,870
with it and it's going to lose so we

308
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:09,230
want technologically but have we won for

309
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:16,040
good have we won what was it that was it

310
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:19,310
it so I want to take a closer look again

311
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:23,180
at these two aspects that I described

312
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:25,369
earlier on in my talk sound money I

313
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,280
think we all understand that money that

314
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:31,910
cannot be inflated by the stage that has

315
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:36,620
a that has a hard cap and so on that

316
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:39,949
cannot be inflated by anybody that's the

317
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:45,250
one part and we achieved it but freedom

318
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:50,450
of transaction freedom of transaction is

319
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:53,210
not anything that you can establish as

320
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:58,000
effect and put it in the world and now

321
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,000
it's there and it cannot go away anymore

322
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,109
why is freedom of transaction so

323
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,660
important for me to want to emphasize it

324
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:09,589
here again today

325
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:14,449
I sincerely believe that freedom of

326
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:19,069
transaction is the Forgotten basic human

327
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:23,660
right amongst freedom to travel freedom

328
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:25,849
of speech freedom to assemble there is

329
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,550
no freedom of transaction in any

330
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:31,790
document in any declaration of human

331
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:38,659
rights and any Constitution in anything

332
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:42,889
anywhere and this is weird on the first

333
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:45,440
few but on the other hand you realize

334
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:48,320
that we never had to fight for it

335
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,120
we always had freedom of transaction the

336
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,790
past where we come from we used to be

337
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,100
used we used all physical money and you

338
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,840
could use physical money without anybody

339
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,050
stopping you you could go into the back

340
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:06,080
room and do your trade but we are moving

341
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:08,830
into the digital real now and everything

342
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,330
our whole lives are becoming digital and

343
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:16,040
I believe that in a digital world

344
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:20,270
freedom of transaction is an absolutely

345
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:22,700
vital superhuman right that you need to

346
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:26,900
have an order to carry out all your

347
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:31,130
other human rights in a digital world I

348
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:33,460
mean of what value is freedom to freedom

349
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:36,430
of speech when you're a dissident

350
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:39,350
somewhere and you cannot have your

351
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:42,590
internet access or your blogging

352
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,990
platform platform in a way that you can

353
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,270
pay it anonymously do you have free

354
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,170
speech as a dissident when the

355
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:53,960
government can find out who said that

356
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:57,920
now you can't what what worse is freedom

357
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,890
to assemble to meet up if you cannot

358
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:04,610
anonymously buy a train ticket to go to

359
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:07,370
the assembly if you look at any of the

360
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:11,330
declared human rights you will find out

361
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:14,199
that they mean nothing without freedom

362
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,540
of transaction

363
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,430
[Music]

364
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,850
I'm totally into biblical metaphors here

365
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:25,830
today and I wanna I mean just just

366
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:28,889
imagine we're getting societies are

367
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:32,250
getting rid of of actual fiat cash of

368
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:36,330
the actual coins and and and and

369
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:39,390
banknotes make no mistake Cash Money

370
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:42,620
will be abolished there is no other way

371
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:46,950
for our economies to move on without

372
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:52,590
abolishing cash there is no way to go

373
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:55,830
further than 0.5 minus 0.5 interest %

374
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,899
interest rates there is no way to force

375
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,600
people to keep their money in banks in

376
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:05,310
in in a world where that money is being

377
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:08,550
bailed in and so on the abolish to

378
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,879
abolish cash is a prerogative for our

379
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:15,360
current financial system to keep

380
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:18,090
continuing that means all your money

381
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,310
will be in digital form and traceable

382
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,649
every chewing gum you buy every cup of

383
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:32,210
coffee every train ticket every

384
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:36,090
everything will be will be recorded and

385
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:39,120
the government or whoever or Facebook

386
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:42,000
maybe in the future I don't know will

387
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,939
always have the possibility to stop you

388
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,100
from interacting economically with

389
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,140
anybody the government can stop you from

390
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,980
buying a package of chewing gum

391
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:56,790
in that cashless society so here's the

392
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,760
other biblical metaphor let me read to

393
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:05,639
you from the Book of Revelations the

394
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:09,090
King James Bible book of revelations

395
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,520
chapter 13 paragraph 16 to 18 and he

396
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,730
causeth all both small and great rich

397
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,580
and poor free and bond to receive a mark

398
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:21,000
in their right hand or on their

399
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:25,110
foreheads and that no man might buy or

400
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,010
sell save he that had the mark or the

401
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:30,790
name of the beast

402
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:33,760
the number of his name I find it quite

403
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,620
quite mind-blowing I'm not some kind of

404
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,270
some kind of hardcore Catholic or

405
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,739
Christian or anything I do like the

406
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:42,668
teachings of Jesus Christ but I also

407
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:45,790
like the ones of Buddha and so don't get

408
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:49,320
me wrong I just find this a great

409
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:54,610
metaphor to actually describe a world

410
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:59,439
without cash money and digital cash is

411
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:02,709
our only rescue in that future where we

412
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,100
will not have the cash we are used to

413
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:13,330
have digital cash is literally the only

414
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:15,189
rescue so again look at we are very

415
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:19,740
often talking about Ennis's whole

416
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:24,520
Austrian economics seeing libertarians

417
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:29,140
bitcoiners crypto enthusiasts talking

418
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:31,379
about sound money but we don't talk

419
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,510
about freedom of transaction that much

420
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,910
and I was thinking about it I was like

421
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:38,470
does sound money actually mean that you

422
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,070
have freedom of transaction and you

423
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:45,030
clearly come to the conclusion no sound

424
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:48,370
soundness of money hardness of money and

425
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:51,010
the right to transact without anybody

426
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:55,059
stopping off from it do not depend on

427
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:58,360
each other you can imagine a sound money

428
00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:01,690
you could imagine a digital currency

429
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:06,899
created by governments that has the

430
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:09,100
monetary qualities of Bitcoin like

431
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,990
government could throw out this kind of

432
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,469
protocol and say like ok nobody can

433
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,059
change the protocol but in the protocol

434
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,770
they could build black lists and white

435
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:25,410
lists and and and all kinds of stuff to

436
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:28,780
be able to stop people from transacting

437
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:31,419
be able to confiscate money be able to

438
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,520
reverse transactions soundness and

439
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:35,350
hardness of soundness of money hardness

440
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,710
of currency does not have much to do

441
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,119
with freedom of transaction

442
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,690
you can also imagine the other way

443
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,658
around

444
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,690
you could have freedom of crimson ow F

445
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:49,429
freedom of transaction with Euro cash

446
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,600
but it's not sound money so you kind of

447
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,830
sound money without freedom of

448
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,209
transaction and you can have freedom of

449
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:58,789
transaction with sunlight without sound

450
00:23:53,210 --> 00:24:04,970
money but I think I would not want to

451
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:10,700
have a future without either so what

452
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:12,679
about freedom of transaction I made of

453
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,119
you know or I copied a few notes here

454
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,869
from another talk of mine

455
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:20,629
let me just read them freedoms that can

456
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:23,178
be taken away always will be taken away

457
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:25,549
there is basically the nature of

458
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,990
government government is here not to

459
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:31,340
protect your freedoms or give you

460
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,690
freedoms government is here to explain

461
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,369
to you that they're protecting your

462
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,529
freedoms while they're taking it away to

463
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:39,110
find nice ways that make you feel good

464
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:41,869
about your freedoms haven't taken away I

465
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,879
here I know I'm I have quite a few

466
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:46,639
friends who are of a different opinion

467
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:49,668
here than me who think that we can fix

468
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:51,830
democracy we can't fix government I

469
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:58,220
don't believe that but I think both

470
00:24:51,830 --> 00:25:00,110
views should be respected so freedom of

471
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,139
transaction like any other freedom is

472
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,908
never achieved for good you have to

473
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:07,129
fight for your freedoms every morning

474
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:10,190
the second you get out of bed or your

475
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:13,399
freedoms are gone so once the fight to

476
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:16,970
achieve freedom of transaction has been

477
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:20,299
won and was successful that very second

478
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:25,720
the fight to defend that freedom starts

479
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:31,730
and if you stop if we stop defending

480
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:39,110
freedom of transaction we will not have

481
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:40,350
that freedom very much longer so bad

482
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:44,549
news

483
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:46,709
sorry bad news is I wrote the question

484
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:50,490
yet who gives a about freedom

485
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:55,169
anyway if you look around I mean I mean

486
00:25:50,490 --> 00:26:01,139
obviously on this conference here is a

487
00:25:55,169 --> 00:26:03,210
gathering of freedom-loving people who

488
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:05,100
know why they are here but you only have

489
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,730
to think of your neighbors probably of

490
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:12,860
your family you were colleagues and so

491
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:17,909
on and so on it's quite obvious that

492
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:20,668
freedom is in no in no way any value in

493
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:25,830
our society anymore if freedom if people

494
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:28,230
would give a about freedom quite

495
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,720
frankly Angela Merkel would be in jail

496
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,730
and at what Snowden would be President

497
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,850
of the United States and all Secret

498
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:41,340
Service's on the planet would have been

499
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:46,590
abolished by now governments can

500
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:51,418
restrict our freedoms more and more and

501
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:55,139
in astonishingly obvious ways and no

502
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:57,029
revolution breaks out I'm not here to

503
00:26:55,139 --> 00:27:00,209
explain why this is the case but it is

504
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:02,750
my observation and I need to think about

505
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:10,169
[Music]

506
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:13,649
how to deal with that and I come to the

507
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:15,929
conclusion I quote myself again here

508
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:18,479
money not only needs to be resistant to

509
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:21,600
dictatorship to dictatorship but also to

510
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:30,490
democracy money must not be subject to

511
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:33,669
any democratic process so the question

512
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:38,050
Rises how do we we have a sort of

513
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:41,070
freedom of of transaction now in Bitcoin

514
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:43,809
but not really we have we have chain

515
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,409
analysis block chain analysis and and

516
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:50,050
all that kind of stuff

517
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:54,120
clearly people some very smart people of

518
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:58,090
working on ways to increase privacy

519
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:01,899
anonymity and functiona T in Bitcoin

520
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:04,600
which is like of most importance more

521
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:07,300
important than scalability literally the

522
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,428
most important thing about Bitcoin I

523
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,770
believe if we don't if we don't get it

524
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:17,800
private and fungible then does no need

525
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:23,320
to scale it really so and I think I

526
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:31,030
think there's there's two things that we

527
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:34,870
can we can focus on in order to not only

528
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:36,820
keep that level or degree of freedom of

529
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:40,209
transaction that we now have in actually

530
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:42,639
to increase it and and finally secure it

531
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:45,910
and one is that we need rock-solid

532
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,770
cockroach protocols that resists not

533
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:50,650
only technological attacks and are

534
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:53,400
resilient to legal attacks but cannot be

535
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:56,020
changed by the opinions of the masses

536
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,480
cockroach protocol because cockroaches

537
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,460
supposedly was alive a nuclear winter so

538
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,770
this is the kind of thing that I imagine

539
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:11,410
I see some people here who are working

540
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:18,000
on on things like that but the other

541
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:21,040
part is really that that that kind of

542
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,260
soft part that the understanding that

543
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:26,200
freedom of transaction is a really

544
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:28,480
important thing sound money doesn't

545
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,420
really need to be explained in the long

546
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,610
run you can explain it might make sense

547
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,220
to explain to somebody why bitcoin is a

548
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:38,620
better money a harder currency than the

549
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:44,110
euro but it's not actually necessary

550
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:50,110
because in not only the long run in

551
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:53,019
short-to-medium future people will

552
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:56,469
understand the soundness of money sound

553
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:59,019
money explains itself as soon as it is

554
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:01,120
in competition with not so sound money

555
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:02,950
and all the people who don't understand

556
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,189
sound money and told on true they're not

557
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:09,549
so sound money well they will just have

558
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,929
a bad time and during that time they

559
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:15,429
will understand what the difference

560
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:17,559
between some money and not so some money

561
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:20,740
is but freedom of transaction is

562
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:22,090
something so well sound money is

563
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,950
something that at the end of the day

564
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,439
everybody who is understood it and who

565
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,330
holds it will realize yeah it's a good

566
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,789
thing to have that it's actually a good

567
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:34,840
thing

568
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:38,320
freedom of transaction it's not such an

569
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,529
obvious good thing for many people

570
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,019
especially when we hear stories about

571
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:47,620
and we will hear many more stories about

572
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:49,809
all the evil stuff that has been done

573
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,439
with Bitcoin and that can be done with

574
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:52,928
Bitcoin

575
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,419
I think these we see these kind of waves

576
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:57,519
of propaganda against Bitcoin sometimes

577
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:00,279
you have a week and every day you read

578
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:03,360
like all the crimes a Bitcoin has been

579
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:08,320
enabling or something like that and

580
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:12,370
clearly we have not seen anything yet

581
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,710
the real threat that Bitcoin poses to

582
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:21,459
the current system has not really yet

583
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:25,690
been understood and the existing system

584
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:30,159
the legacy system will get more will get

585
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:33,970
the the more desperate the more it

586
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:38,710
up and it is about up don't have to

587
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:40,779
go into into day-to-day economics right

588
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,470
now I believe everybody looks at minus

589
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:43,470
0.4

590
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:59,460
person interest rates and so on and so

591
00:31:45,720 --> 00:32:03,270
on but where I see a danger is in is the

592
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:05,360
fact that that freedom of transaction as

593
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:08,668
a good thing cannot be so easily

594
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:13,439
understood by a lot of people and a lot

595
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:18,000
of people will just follow what their

596
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,909
media tell them they will get scared

597
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,280
because of I mean I mean when they

598
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:25,919
prohibited gold or the the ownership of

599
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,379
gold I and I think 1930 no no no hold on

600
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,669
when there was when in both cases when

601
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:36,179
they when they were able it the

602
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:38,909
ownership of gold in 1933 31 no 71 was

603
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:40,559
when Nixon took the backing of the the

604
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:42,990
gold backing of the dollar a but that's

605
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,620
the other in both cases they argued they

606
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:49,740
argued it to to make the population safe

607
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:53,699
to protect the population and the dollar

608
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:56,070
from the evil gold speculators like gold

609
00:32:53,700 --> 00:33:00,030
went up and up and up you know in price

610
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:01,379
for a reason you know because they

611
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,970
inflated the dollar you could actually

612
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,799
say the dollar went down and down and

613
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,419
down because they printed so much of it

614
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,070
but at the end of the day most people

615
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,299
will believe their president when he

616
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,980
tells them that the evil gold

617
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:14,190
speculators and in the future it will be

618
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,610
the evil Bitcoin speculators who

619
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:21,659
up the economy and that's why freedom of

620
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:26,760
transaction is a really bad thing anyway

621
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:29,460
bottom bottom line what we work what

622
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:34,140
really concerns me right now is how can

623
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:37,679
we how can we promote freedom of

624
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:40,350
transactions as a basic human right we

625
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,890
will not be able to get the United

626
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:45,750
Nations to write it in some some some

627
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:48,690
human rights declaration or anything

628
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:51,179
like that I can promise you that so it's

629
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:54,809
not about trying to convince political

630
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:57,230
organizations or it's all about

631
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:59,450
convincing them

632
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,340
from the fair about the fact that

633
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,710
freedom of transaction is a good thing

634
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,360
and important for all of us it is is

635
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:11,359
literally important for us to convince

636
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:14,139
all our fellow human beings so this is

637
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,460
the end of my talk I believe so yeah I

638
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:19,099
would like to I would like to push

639
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,960
freedom of transaction into the focus

640
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:23,510
and this is something this is something

641
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,040
where everybody can do something you

642
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,800
might sit down gonna as I said before

643
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,839
you know I'm not a cryptographer I'm

644
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,389
really the worst coder that I know

645
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,060
so I cannot contribute to Bitcoin and to

646
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:38,119
this wonderful movement of liberation in

647
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,690
these kinds of things you probably can't

648
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,700
either

649
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,310
maybe one two or three in this audience

650
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:46,699
are brilliant enough to to help us

651
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:49,279
technologically the rest of us I think

652
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:51,500
for the rest of us the most important

653
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,839
thing is to explain Bitcoin to the rest

654
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,668
of humanity and also to explain to them

655
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,710
why freedom of transaction is such an

656
00:34:55,668 --> 00:35:00,830
important thing and okay let me make my

657
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:03,560
less sense so I would have suggestions

658
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:05,960
how to do that just be creative or let's

659
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,750
do a workshop on it or whatever but if

660
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,880
it has to be just go and tell them that

661
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:14,900
in a digital world without freedom of

662
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:18,619
transaction the Beast has won and we

663
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,359
will be living in hell and tonight when

664
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:22,510
we drink do us a favor

665
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:25,640
now and then when you bring out a toast

666
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:26,180
say to freedom of transaction thank you

667
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:36,109
very much

668
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:36,109
[Applause]

669
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:49,609
no questions that's cool have some time

670
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:54,098
so we can do a few questions I guess if

671
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:57,589
you want I'm fine okay so any question

672
00:35:54,099 --> 00:36:01,539
yes it will be hard to get there or I

673
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:01,538
will either just use a like human letter

674
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:09,770
yeah I heard about your opinion on

675
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:11,538
exchanges and online wallets actually

676
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:18,049
I'm running one do you really consider

677
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:20,030
me evil yes now now look at that head

678
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:22,250
right you said you're gonna heck your

679
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:28,190
conference wearing a black head and

680
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:30,319
asking if you don't know seriously no I

681
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,539
don't want to or maybe I should drop

682
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:34,849
names I don't know I know one two or

683
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:37,520
three companies in this room who I know

684
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:42,140
are really good people who want to just

685
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:46,400
bring Bitcoin forward and I quote one

686
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:50,118
CEO I'm not saying from which company he

687
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,980
was literally like because I told him

688
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:54,260
exactly that story I told him look but

689
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,359
in I believe you are literally in the

690
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,549
situation of the money changers in the

691
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:08,420
temple scene you know in the New

692
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:10,609
Testament so no that wasn't a problem

693
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,650
that wasn't a problem the money changers

694
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:14,839
would have ripped people off and scammed

695
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:16,609
them out of their hard-earned money if

696
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:19,308
they would have been in any other place

697
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:23,180
they just took the temple gave them

698
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:26,990
importance you know no literally we have

699
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,690
companies that I would fully trust but

700
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,729
seriously the majority come on look at

701
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,869
people like coinbase look at people look

702
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,020
at people like bitpay

703
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:39,650
look at all these these companies where

704
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:42,788
you can clearly see they are literally

705
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:45,890
working against the whole

706
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:48,349
decentralization thing against the whole

707
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:50,000
peer-to-peer thing and it actually it

708
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,100
probably makes sense for them because

709
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,640
they're corporations they have CEO

710
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:57,200
CEOs are bound by law to do the best for

711
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,790
their shareholders and this is the best

712
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,089
they can do for share for their

713
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:04,550
shareholders I'm not saying that you

714
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:11,680
personally are an evil person sir I

715
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:13,970
don't know you and your company mm-hmm I

716
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:18,470
understand that we need on and off ramps

717
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:21,020
I also understand and I see a few faces

718
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:23,029
here in this room that when we started

719
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,620
with Bitcoin Latorre no exchange

720
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:27,230
has existed and we didn't need any

721
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,509
 exchange right okay you kind of

722
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:37,990
people want to have their convenience

723
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:43,420
and whatever your argument is adoption

724
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:46,669
exchanges kyc and AML on and off ramps

725
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,500
boost adoption but it's a kind of

726
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:52,100
adoption that I literally don't give a

727
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:54,470
 about I'd rather I've said this

728
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:59,900
before on this conference last year I

729
00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:01,790
rather see a slow adoption of Bitcoin by

730
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:06,590
people who understand what they're

731
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:08,930
actually doing then a fast adoption by

732
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:11,060
people who want to jump onto a train

733
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:13,279
that made some other people some money

734
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:16,100
without having a clue and then taken the

735
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:20,840
first digital bearer asset of humanity

736
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:23,560
and storing it in a bank no that's my

737
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,560
personal thing

738
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:37,480
okay we have a second vision here and

739
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:41,560
can you explain your optimism why a

740
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,870
currency that by design is needs bolt

741
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,600
ons and add-ons and expansions to

742
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:48,790
provide some sort of privacy will

743
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:52,930
ultimately end up to provide freeing of

744
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:59,140
transaction that needs boats and errands

745
00:39:52,930 --> 00:40:05,379
and stuff why would I care why if I have

746
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:08,319
a proven evidently private side chain on

747
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:10,630
which I can transact my Bitcoin why

748
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,940
would I care and I guess that's what you

749
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:16,180
mean with add-ons something like a side

750
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:19,330
chain or something on top like a coin

751
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,640
join or something like that no I don't

752
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:25,210
care at all as long as we can achieve

753
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:27,279
that privacy why would I care about the

754
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:32,170
fact that it's achieved with add-ons why

755
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:45,160
would you okay I'm a complex person

756
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:48,910
that's okay no okay so crypto is a hedge

757
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:51,129
against fiat money gold and silver are

758
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:54,399
also hedges do you think there is a

759
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:57,550
place in the future for those two asset

760
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,340
classes as in the time forwards and then

761
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:03,640
secondly negative interest rates are

762
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:06,610
only a measure of desperation so even if

763
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,650
they go minus 2 minus 3 it will not be

764
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:10,870
enough they just buy time and then they

765
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:15,850
have to go to minus 4 and to minus 10

766
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:18,970
and then to - banana so it's just in the

767
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:21,910
long run something has to break and what

768
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:25,060
is done the true endgame and his art job

769
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,770
then not to just winter the storm they

770
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,380
cannot go around and kill everybody

771
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:32,230
because if you start doing playing that

772
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:34,900
game and I will have to start that to

773
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:38,140
play that game as well also I heard two

774
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,640
questions I believe first of all I see

775
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,400
no reason why at least gold will not

776
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,549
keep a certain

777
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,440
[Music]

778
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:47,350
property is a store of value in the

779
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,880
future just for the simple fact it's

780
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:54,730
been around for so long maybe when when

781
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,880
it's getting really it's getting cheaper

782
00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:00,670
too when it's getting cheaper to to mine

783
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,310
an ounce of gold on the moon or some

784
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:06,220
asteroid then the price of an ounce of

785
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:08,680
gold right and ours that's far away

786
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:13,959
anyhow yeah but I'm

787
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:15,790
look I'm I love gold but I'm here to

788
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,680
talk with Bitcoin yeah but I don't see

789
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:20,140
any reason why my gold would not have a

790
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,710
role in the future and your second

791
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:28,540
question was was about interest rates of

792
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:31,510
course there is no there is no

793
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:34,630
sustainability in lowering interest

794
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:36,640
rates further and further there just is

795
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:40,720
none this is like it's it's so crazy it

796
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,569
took me so long now to understand why

797
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,819
people how can they even be people

798
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:52,480
organizations institutions whatever who

799
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:55,480
buy a 30-year German bond at minus 0.1

800
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:00,400
percent interest just didn't click with

801
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:02,860
me I was like you know it's just I'm not

802
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,940
smart enough person then now they're

803
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:08,170
selling Oh - Oh point a this is to you

804
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:11,380
look he's asking a question and then

805
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,400
he's - okay and you that so anyway

806
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:16,120
I didn't understand it now they're

807
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,400
selling - 0.3 percent bonds and now it

808
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:23,230
clicked with me it was like of course

809
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:25,390
the guy who brought the - 0.1% was smart

810
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:27,850
enough to know that the minus 0.3 is

811
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:30,609
gonna come and then Oh minus 0.1 was a

812
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:33,339
great deal and he can sell the minus 0.1

813
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:38,800
percent bond on to somebody else for

814
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:41,170
minus 0.4 an extra 0.1% premium then the

815
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,360
guy who buys that actually still makes a

816
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:45,670
better deal than the guy who buys the

817
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:49,600
bond for minus 0.3 percent but it's

818
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:51,250
crazy it's madness it's it's madness and

819
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,380
and the faster it goes and it goes

820
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:58,989
faster and faster

821
00:43:53,380 --> 00:44:02,829
you will see that they come up with

822
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:06,460
either abolishing cash because they have

823
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:11,079
to and I don't know estimations go like

824
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:14,380
at at minus two or three percent every

825
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:16,960
single little bank account will suffer

826
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,289
negative interest rates not only the big

827
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,269
companies and big banks or something and

828
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:25,299
other estimates say like that at the

829
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:27,399
latest it minus five percent people will

830
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:30,369
want to take their money out of the bank

831
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:36,009
and store it in their mattress and and

832
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:38,400
that moment will come and they will have

833
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:42,359
to that's what that's why cash

834
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,359
necessarily will have to be abolished

835
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:47,259
this his answer was for this gentleman

836
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:50,019
he didn't hear it though yes so but

837
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:59,920
there was the otherwise dance am I right

838
00:44:50,019 --> 00:45:03,700
or no okay so thank you for a talk

839
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,460
really great and regarding adoption slow

840
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,769
or fast as on one side we should have a

841
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,509
proper adoption and keep it a little

842
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:11,950
slow pace because when we look at the

843
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:14,259
infrastructure we have to build out a

844
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:17,109
lot but if you're listening to people

845
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:19,180
like Marcos crawl from Germany he's

846
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:21,160
clearly saying that we will have a

847
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,288
European banking crisis within the next

848
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,180
two years because the negative interest

849
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:28,450
is interest rates are definitely

850
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:31,868
destroying the whole banking business

851
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:34,598
model and your thoughts on I don't know

852
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:36,719
that you're much time do we have is that

853
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:41,200
your question how much time do we have

854
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:42,969
look I mean ten years ago I would have

855
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,649
said in five years and then they came up

856
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:46,390
with negative interest rate so I don't

857
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:49,960
know what kind of Voodoo they still have

858
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:51,549
up their sleeves but it's it's quite

859
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,650
obvious you have to look at certain

860
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:56,380
things you in regards to negative

861
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:59,519
interest rates you can actually see the

862
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:02,170
first banks in Germany moving into

863
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:05,019
unprofitable territory

864
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,700
no deutsche is not there yet and comets

865
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:08,649
bunk nor either but they're near there

866
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,538
there is actually a nice chart online

867
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:13,000
that shows you which Bank is actually

868
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:14,619
already unprofitable it's still less

869
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,720
than ten ten percent or something but

870
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:18,400
the others are and the further you move

871
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,578
down with the interest rates then you

872
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,000
have the problem of of some B

873
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:26,769
corporations I can only I can only speak

874
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,019
about Germany here but and this is

875
00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:31,118
something that literally nobody looks at

876
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:34,950
you really you don't read about that

877
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:37,930
anywhere turns out that the average

878
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:41,410
percentage of companies and in any given

879
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:43,930
economy that go bankrupt is about one

880
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:47,140
point five to two percent a year that's

881
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:48,819
like a healthy cleaning of you know

882
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:51,129
these are these are companies that are

883
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:52,569
not competitive anymore that make the

884
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:54,039
wrong product that have the wrong

885
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:56,349
marketing or whatever they go bankrupt

886
00:46:54,039 --> 00:47:01,240
for some reason one point five to two

887
00:46:56,349 --> 00:47:04,019
percent in any economy literally that is

888
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:07,299
kind of kind of function since 2008

889
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:11,078
since we have quantitative easing

890
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:13,900
since the banks are literally forced to

891
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:16,930
find someone where they can stuff the

892
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:21,759
money in funnily enough that number

893
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:26,348
dropped to below 0.5 that is such a

894
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:29,799
clear sign that means that one point

895
00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:32,920
zero to one point five percent of all

896
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:35,049
corporations every year that should go

897
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,049
bankrupt because they are not profitable

898
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:41,589
anymore did not go bankrupt because they

899
00:47:38,049 --> 00:47:45,339
got this cheap money that started in

900
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:48,430
2008 it's 2019 that means that fifteen

901
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:51,640
percent literally fifteen percent of the

902
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:54,669
German economy has by now to be

903
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:59,859
considered zombie companies that will

904
00:47:54,670 --> 00:48:03,849
just blow up as soon as the flow of

905
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:06,400
cheap money stops and the flow of cheap

906
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:08,920
money stops when the banks stopped

907
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,230
getting stopped being profitable at all

908
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,869
and that's what we just talked about so

909
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,820
but you don't but no need I don't have

910
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:17,560
an answer as I said when you

911
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:21,760
ago I would is that in five years but

912
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:28,240
who knows all this voodoo they come up

913
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:30,640
with but yeah tomorrow I also want to

914
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,580
make one point is I also want to make

915
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,290
one point this is nothing I wish for

916
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:37,810
amongst cold bucks and also about

917
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,940
Bitcoin enthusiasts you find a lot of

918
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:43,180
people who are literally waiting for

919
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:46,060
this crash to happen because then gold

920
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:47,830
will shine or Bitcoin I will have

921
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:50,980
Bitcoin and everything else will go down

922
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:53,230
I'm not looking forward to this moment I

923
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:56,560
hope it takes as long as possible I hope

924
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:59,170
it's a slow decline and I hope it's slow

925
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,810
enough so more and more people can learn

926
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:04,270
and understand and how to get out of it

927
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:07,420
that would be so much because if we get

928
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:08,340
this complete and total crash it won't

929
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,110
be funny

930
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,820
also not if you have gold and also not

931
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:15,090
if you have Bitcoin it just won't be

932
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,090
funny

933
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:29,940
so right on that point would you call it

934
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:33,060
then an apocalyptic cult because it

935
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,829
seems to be a quite present yes values

936
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,099
central banking is an apocalyptic

937
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:45,450
culture

938
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:47,400
yes so we run out of time so I would

939
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:49,379
like to thank to York for his

940
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:54,829
presentation and thank you all for

941
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,829
coming here thank you thanks
