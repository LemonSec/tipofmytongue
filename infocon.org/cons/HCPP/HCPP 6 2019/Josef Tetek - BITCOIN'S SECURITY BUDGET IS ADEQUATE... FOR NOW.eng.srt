3
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:33,500
so hello everybody welcome back on slave

4
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,500
on a stage

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,100
we know that competition right now is

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,370
very hard but Youssef will be the best

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,750
presently you definitely seen today

8
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:49,849
maybe tomorrow and next few months also

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,720
I'm very proud that I can invite to

10
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:56,449
stage use aesthetic who is for a long

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,460
time with the parallel community as as a

12
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:01,190
member of para una police club

13
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:06,259
he is also he very early found out about

14
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:08,119
the Bitcoin and he but from 2015 he said

15
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:12,259
he is very much involved he works as a

16
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:14,630
developer for our cooperative with top

17
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:18,080
monks and also he's working on the

18
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,479
project of de bank and right now he is

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,390
ready for his presentation about Bitcoin

20
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,399
I also have to say that he is he is one

21
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,890
who is helping us with the bitcoin

22
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:29,539
meetups in para una police so I'm very

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,090
thankful to him for this so here's a

24
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:37,759
floor is yours thank you

25
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:39,319
so yeah for the interaction so we are

26
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,590
going to have some fun

27
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:45,560
analyzing Bitcoin security budget so we

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,580
here who here has heard about the term

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,929
security budget in relation to Bitcoin

30
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,399
okay just a couple of guys that's good

31
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:56,239
because you're actually going to learn

32
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,970
something new all right so when I was

33
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,160
like going to representation with my

34
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:04,640
wife which I highly recommend because

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:08,840
wives are like good honest critics of

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,610
your work she said like you know I don't

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,129
really get it what you're saying because

38
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,950
it's this crazy Bitcoin stuff but maybe

39
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:19,190
the first the beginning you should say

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,220
like why are you talking about it so so

41
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:25,519
the motivation for the talk is that this

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,609
idea that bitcoin is like low

43
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,190
transaction fee payment system this

44
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,620
needs to be destroyed and the comparison

45
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,650
for example to visa owner transaction

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,540
per second basis is really stupid

47
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,819
because bitcoin was never

48
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,239
meant to be that and Bitcoin was never

49
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:47,060
designed that way we can have like other

50
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,489
comparisons with visa but on like volume

51
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:54,370
basis not on like transaction account

52
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:58,069
and the basic inspiration for the talk

53
00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:00,560
are the worlds of great Bitcoin analysts

54
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:04,060
then he'll Danica Carter up all sorts

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,030
and hasu and my talk is actually like

56
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,849
synthesis of their talks and trying to

57
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:15,769
like move their ideas a little bit

58
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:17,268
further and derive something new so what

59
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,060
what is actually a security budget

60
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:23,629
security budget is like the sum of

61
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:28,450
payments that we pay for Bitcoin miners

62
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:30,819
in order to secure the immutability and

63
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,439
irreversibility of our transactions

64
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,659
security budget is also called like

65
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,590
mining rewards and wining cohort

66
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:42,260
consists of block subsidies and

67
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,620
transaction fees and as I've been

68
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,659
learning about Bitcoin over the years

69
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,359
sometimes called like going down the

70
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:53,239
rabbit hole of learning about Bitcoin I

71
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:55,250
found that at the bottom of the rabbit

72
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,720
hole is actually the security budget

73
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:03,440
because if you start thinking about

74
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:07,209
Bitcoin on like the economics of Bitcoin

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:12,199
you find out it all revolves around this

76
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:14,479
measure around security budget so if we

77
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:17,419
are going to make some forward-looking

78
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,729
statements about Bitcoin I think we

79
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:21,649
should start with analyzing security

80
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:24,349
budget and there are three basic

81
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:27,739
questions when it comes to security

82
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:31,250
budget how can we actually know that we

83
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:34,010
are not under parent miners that we are

84
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,949
not overpaying - or if we know this

85
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,840
question for now and for the past how

86
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:44,870
can we know that we won't do so in the

87
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:48,799
future yeah and you can approach this

88
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:51,940
problem from like two lines of thinking

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,010
you can either try to derive the

90
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,130
like something like an adequate security

91
00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:01,420
budget from the market cap as some

92
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:03,850
analysts have tried to do but that's not

93
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:08,250
really telling us much because market

94
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:11,950
cap itself is like really mean in class

95
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:15,910
measure if you take a look for example

96
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,640
at UT XO h you can see that about 4

97
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,950
million bitcoins haven't moved in more

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,099
than five years so actually the market

99
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,380
cap may be overstated by more than 20%

100
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,260
because we don't know if this UT exos

101
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,740
are actually spendable a lot of those

102
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,740
bitcoins are lost and market cap just

103
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,860
doesn't tell us anything it's just this

104
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,230
stock measure we need to go for the flow

105
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,870
measure because security budget is

106
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:47,290
actually highly relevant to what goes on

107
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:51,010
what goes on now on a daily basis not

108
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:53,350
just some big total aggregate so the

109
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,230
second second line of thinking how you

110
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:59,800
can derive the security budget is by

111
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:04,510
looking at the unseen transfers what get

112
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,100
what gets transacted on chain for

113
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,640
example on a daily basis and we are

114
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,740
going to analyze that all right so let's

115
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,180
answer the first question that's quite

116
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,350
easy how can we know that we don't

117
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:20,440
underplay miners well first of all

118
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:23,650
bitcoin is here for 10 years and as far

119
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,530
as we know we haven't seen a real like

120
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:29,830
double spend 15% attack that would try

121
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,049
to like inject the alternate history so

122
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,969
that somebody will be scammed on the

123
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,270
blockchain although of course we had

124
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:39,580
some double spans like with zero

125
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,979
confirmation transactions that's

126
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,800
actually what Charlie Hill is doing here

127
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,490
on across Congress with his with his app

128
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,490
and with his workshops but we didn't he

129
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,860
never saw like a double spent attack on

130
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,230
the blockchain itself when some

131
00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,910
previously mined blocks would be

132
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:04,360
reworked and we have a nice case study

133
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,680
that sees it from finance like provided

134
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,080
us this year

135
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,990
because in May 2009 teen violence was

136
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,990
hacked and about 7,000 bitcoins were

137
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:17,169
stolen that was worth about 40 million

138
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,479
dollars back then and he got this crazy

139
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:22,120
idea it wasn't actually his idea at

140
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:25,270
first I think it first from Jeremy

141
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:29,229
Rubino you get this idea that he could

142
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:31,710
try to rework the chain and either get

143
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:34,389
those coins back or just distribute them

144
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,539
among the miners so that he would hurt

145
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:40,630
the hacker fortunately he discussed that

146
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:43,599
with his good friend good old Jehan who

147
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:47,340
and others and he understood that the

148
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:51,610
idea is stupid and it would be hugely

149
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:53,258
costly to do yet all right so so we can

150
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,349
be quite sure that we don't underplay

151
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:59,229
miners compared to some other coins

152
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:03,219
which were actually attacked with a 51%

153
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:08,469
attack so how can we know that we don't

154
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:14,229
underplay miners and interesting fact is

155
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:17,620
that Nick Carter who like did some great

156
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:19,330
analysis of security budget I highly

157
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,889
recommend this article it's the

158
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,780
settlement assurance he stupid

159
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:29,320
it's his title so Nicky says this is

160
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:34,240
actually in my view due to like this

161
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:37,120
fixed block subsidies and high notional

162
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,490
amount of singular Bitcoin units we are

163
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,980
probably hire highly overpaying miners

164
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:46,770
and I will try to like critique this

165
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:52,180
idea because I don't think oh this is so

166
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:54,040
but let's say Nick's idea it makes kind

167
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,760
of sense at the first glance because

168
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,790
it's true we have fixed block subsidies

169
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,970
first we had like 50 bitcoins per block

170
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:07,300
25 bitcoins 12.5 that's where we are now

171
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:11,170
and every four years these get soft

172
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,810
right so yeah we can we can say miners

173
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:17,620
get 12 or find bitcoins now it's true

174
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:19,339
that as has two other great analytical

175
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,910
mind says

176
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:26,430
like the token itself Bitcoin doesn't

177
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,130
have any intrinsic value it doesn't have

178
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,649
any value by itself the only value is

179
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:36,569
there on like the social layer which is

180
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:40,110
just a fancy term for the market so the

181
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:42,889
market decides what is the Wharf of the

182
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:47,430
Bitcoin that miners get so of course

183
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:52,380
12.5 Bitcoin in 2016 after the having is

184
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:55,258
not the same purchasing power as - 12.5

185
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:58,350
bitcoins now and we can see that on the

186
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:03,089
next chart this is how much the miners

187
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:07,079
earn on a daily basis as a daily median

188
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:09,180
in USD all through the history and it's

189
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:13,439
analog scale right so that it's actually

190
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:16,979
readable I have put the floor at $10,000

191
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,560
because this before 2011 they didn't

192
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,420
receive much it's the total mining

193
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,180
rewards total security budget so that

194
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,069
means it's both the BOC subsidies and

195
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,319
the transaction fees but the transaction

196
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:29,729
fees actually make up like two or three

197
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:34,920
percent of the mining crew vaults so

198
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:38,339
it's mostly just prop subsidies and you

199
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:42,959
can see in 2016 after the whole thing

200
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:45,959
which was like in q2 miners got like two

201
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:50,430
million dollars daily and now they still

202
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:53,430
make 12.5 Bitcoin per block but sorry

203
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:57,599
here they get twenty million dollars so

204
00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:00,540
the same block subsidy trans translates

205
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,269
to hugely different like purchasing

206
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:07,680
power and you can actually see that even

207
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:10,339
before the having miners got like 25

208
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,170
bitcoins per block let's say but it was

209
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,910
worth much less so it doesn't actually

210
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,009
matter how much bitcoins they get

211
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,709
what matters is like the purchasing

212
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,540
power you don't have to measure it

213
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:26,430
actually in dollars you can measure it

214
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:28,319
in like his burgers or whatever but the

215
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,030
fact is that Bitcoin doesn't exist

216
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:35,949
though as in some vacuum

217
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:39,040
it's and it's like mm measured in real

218
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:43,060
world stuff whether it's towers or check

219
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,630
rounds or beers or whatever all right so

220
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,869
this chart tells us how much does

221
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:52,810
Bitcoin actually transfer on a daily

222
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,580
basis in dollar terms it's a median

223
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,060
which i think is a much better measure

224
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,660
than averages and we can see the dynamic

225
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,280
is quite similar to the mining rewards

226
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:07,750
right so right now

227
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,839
bitcoins work chain on chain actually on

228
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,620
chain transfers around two billion

229
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:17,980
dollars daily and you can see that I

230
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,930
have two curves here I have data from

231
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,200
POC chain dot info and cone metrics and

232
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:26,489
they are a little bit similar actually

233
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,060
the difference is a multiple of two

234
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:32,530
blockchain dot info tells us that we

235
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,229
between transfers 1 billion dollars

236
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:38,589
daily while corn matrix tells us it's

237
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:41,620
two billion dollars daily so as a side

238
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,540
note on like Bitcoin data and this is

239
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,690
quite interesting because there are two

240
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:50,380
things we don't actually accurately know

241
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:53,830
about what goes on in Bitcoin the first

242
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,900
one is as the world has seen you know

243
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,960
recently like two weeks ago we didn't

244
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,819
actually know what the hash rate is

245
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,970
right some some analysts thought that

246
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:06,480
the hash rate dropped 40 percent one day

247
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,339
because that's what the data showed us

248
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,850
there was a drop of 40 percent on one

249
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:15,339
day in rehearse right but the thin case

250
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,800
we cannot accurately measure the

251
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:22,150
short-term rate because it's measured

252
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:25,089
just it's derived actually from the time

253
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:27,060
difference between each mind blocks so

254
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:30,700
to the surprise of many

255
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,859
decipher it went back up the next day so

256
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,350
there actually wasn't any drop in hash

257
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,650
rate it was just just the deviation in

258
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:41,020
how the data is derived and the same

259
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:44,319
thing applies also to

260
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,079
net on chain transfers and this might

261
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,850
seem kind of strange because we can see

262
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:53,080
on the blockchain how much of bitcoins

263
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:56,820
get transacted but the raw transactions

264
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,410
themselves don't tell us like what the

265
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,029
economically significant transfers are

266
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,430
because there are a lot of change

267
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:07,150
outputs and there are a lot of like it's

268
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:10,569
called short-term hopes transactions

269
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:12,760
spend for example after one confirmation

270
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,880
which usually happens if somebody does

271
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:19,240
like a lot of transactions from his own

272
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,570
wallet and he just mixes it so that's

273
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,700
actually what it is actually how both

274
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,210
blockchain that info and climate risks

275
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:34,950
try to derive like the daily net

276
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:38,589
transfers by subscribe by actually

277
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:40,150
taking out the change outputs or what

278
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:41,950
they think our children to change

279
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,930
outputs because we we are not actually

280
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,750
sure what the change of outputs are and

281
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:50,859
by taking out like these short-term

282
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:54,430
hopes right so you don't actually know

283
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,920
how much gets transferred on chain in

284
00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:01,779
the short term but in the long term we

285
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:05,589
can see that it has some trend right the

286
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:07,360
same stuff as with hash right it's a bad

287
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:09,010
measure for the short term but a good

288
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,610
measure for the long term it's like

289
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,939
derivation alright and in the next slide

290
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,490
I'm actually using the coin matrix data

291
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,920
because from the perspective of security

292
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:26,670
budget it's actually more conservative

293
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:30,279
right all right so this is like my

294
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:35,949
attempt to derive something like an

295
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:40,510
adequate security budget I measure here

296
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:44,080
the ratio of mining rewards to the daily

297
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:47,020
transfers so that means what kind of

298
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,930
percentage do miners earn when compared

299
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:53,170
to how much gets transferred on a daily

300
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,160
basis in the long term both you know

301
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,910
like

302
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:01,719
millions right it's not averages we just

303
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:04,959
measure the medians and it's kind of

304
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,220
interesting we see that after like the

305
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,910
first years

306
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:15,670
it dropped heavily and then it gets kind

307
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:18,490
of flat and actually if we measure like

308
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,800
the correlation between between mining

309
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,040
coal volts and the data transfers the

310
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,008
correlation is quite big it's like 0.97

311
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,860
for the ten-year period for the

312
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:33,220
five-year period it's like 0.95 so

313
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:36,879
there's quite a big correlation here all

314
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:40,720
right this is a zoom of the same metric

315
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:43,689
rewards to transfers but just for five

316
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,589
years and to buy to the recent five

317
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:49,719
years because there are three points why

318
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:53,050
I think this is like significant and

319
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:58,110
relevant first of all in the past five

320
00:16:53,050 --> 00:17:05,490
years like all the metrics have just

321
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:09,849
blown up like the price the volumes and

322
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:14,319
the eruption it just like 100 times

323
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:18,188
larger compared to like 2015 the second

324
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,829
point is we have like a professional

325
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:26,260
like the mining industry got much more

326
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:30,299
professional in 2016 I think it was q1

327
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:35,919
or q2 and -9 was introduced and this was

328
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:39,059
17 nanometer miner and for like next I

329
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,500
think three or four years no sorry

330
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:46,480
couldn't be for years it was for three

331
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:48,730
years this was the peak of the possible

332
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,330
architecture so that there was no longer

333
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:56,679
like this race of the miners to get the

334
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,600
newest asset miner and just to mine as

335
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,549
much as possible in a short term as

336
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,459
possible and that's why in the first

337
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,899
years you got this concentration of ash

338
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,520
right in China because they were the

339
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:09,479
closest to the far

340
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,190
but that doesn't actually happen anymore

341
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,060
after we reached like peak efficiency

342
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:18,340
with 17 nanometer and miners there there

343
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:22,629
were like seven nanometer and miners

344
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:24,270
introduced I think in December 2018 but

345
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,060
you can see it doesn't actually change

346
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,860
the economics that much anymore right

347
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,330
because the mining industry is much more

348
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,120
professional and much more competitive

349
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:37,780
so what now

350
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,939
matters is like the long-term efficiency

351
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:43,389
of the miners when it comes to like

352
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:45,280
operational expenditure alright and what

353
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,340
you also like the third points

354
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,649
what you got in these five years is you

355
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,389
get a hole in here

356
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,580
and you can see after the having like

357
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,100
the ratio of the rewards to the

358
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,590
transfers kind of dropped but then you

359
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,340
cut up and it was actually even higher

360
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:07,000
than before the whole thing after some

361
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:09,639
time so you can see you can I think you

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,070
can start seeing like the emerging

363
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,620
pattern of the underlying Bitcoin

364
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:18,159
economics and when it comes to security

365
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:20,919
budget in these five years and like the

366
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,420
average of this ratio over the five year

367
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:27,480
period is 0.8 percent and the median is

368
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,610
0.7 percent and I think this is quite

369
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,480
quite a beautiful number especially the

370
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:37,149
median because when we compare it with

371
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,280
something it's kind of mind-blowing and

372
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:42,940
I'm going to get there in a few seconds

373
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,389
so let us just help ourselves right now

374
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,710
with two key oh two quotes from Dan

375
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:52,270
health and Nick Carter

376
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:55,990
so 10 health points out the security

377
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:59,950
budget is relevant only actually as a

378
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:02,440
protection to the 51% attack which

379
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:06,190
happens at the tip of the blockchain

380
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:10,750
right only like for the recent blocks is

381
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:14,020
data relevant because even at for the

382
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:16,630
out coins that were 51% attacked there

383
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,210
was no like complete chain rewrite it

384
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,239
was just like last couple of hundred

385
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:26,739
so that they could get recruits can

386
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:28,330
exchange and what nick says has

387
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:30,099
something to do with like this

388
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:33,489
professionalization of the mining

389
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:37,029
industry because at the time of winning

390
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:39,159
the block the miner has probably burned

391
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:42,099
resources roughly equivalent to the

392
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,229
value of the block with just a small

393
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:45,729
margin because the industry is much more

394
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:48,879
competitive and much more professional

395
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:50,909
and there's no longer this race to get

396
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:54,459
the latest shake anymore

397
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:57,549
so the miner has to be incentivized to

398
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,889
actually play nice create valid and rule

399
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:02,619
following blocks and not try to rework

400
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:05,998
the tip of the blockchain like Donald

401
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:09,428
says all right so having this in mind

402
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:11,139
why is actually this number significant

403
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:15,789
like the average of the five year period

404
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:19,238
0.1% and the median 0.7% just for the

405
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:22,450
reminder this is like the ratio of the

406
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:24,549
mining pre wards compared with like

407
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:29,159
daily transfers what get transferred on

408
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:32,859
the conversion so when we take a look at

409
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:36,249
daily blocks there are 144 blocks per

410
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:42,009
day and one block out of these 144

411
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:45,339
percent of 144 is like the division gets

412
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:48,960
us a result of 0.7 percent which is the

413
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:51,609
same seems nice but maybe it's just like

414
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:57,159
random but I don't think it's actually a

415
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:59,830
random because how much value how how

416
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:03,190
Wharf would we expect this one block to

417
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:06,879
be we would expect it like a typical

418
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:09,879
block to be Wharf like 0.7 percent of

419
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:13,119
the daily transfers right if you have

420
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:17,468
like this equal distribution of the

421
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:20,529
value between the blocks daily you would

422
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:24,159
have this you would expect that the

423
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:27,029
block is worth this much like if 144

424
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,940
million dollars were transferred daily

425
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:32,590
then one block would be worth 1 million

426
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:38,169
dollars right

427
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:44,020
so now how is that relevant compared to

428
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:47,470
like mine intervals we need miners to

429
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,150
actually produce valid rule-following

430
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,340
blocks that are not attacking the

431
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,799
network so it means we have to

432
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:57,340
incentivize the miners to accept the

433
00:22:53,799 --> 00:23:01,389
reward and not accept like the reorg

434
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:05,470
yield right and the reorg yield or real

435
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:10,899
reward would be worth that much because

436
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:13,240
if we go for a reward the maximum reward

437
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:17,110
that you might not get could get is how

438
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:20,140
much the single block is worth which on

439
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:23,590
the long term is this number 0.7% like

440
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:27,970
the $1,000,000 for example so in order

441
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:31,059
for the miners to play it nice we need

442
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:34,210
them to have at least on a long-term

443
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:37,240
basis the same amount as they would get

444
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:41,260
if they are trying to rework the blocks

445
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,750
so I think this is like kind of nice

446
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,480
kind of mind blowing that we see that

447
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:51,940
the economics of Bitcoin of the mining

448
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:55,870
rewards like gets in disharmony right

449
00:23:51,940 --> 00:24:00,059
with what you would expect all right so

450
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:03,010
this is this is like the theory or the

451
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:07,178
trying to explain the do you observe

452
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:10,840
correlation in a nutshell right so miner

453
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:13,570
has to be incentivized to not attack the

454
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,029
blockchain to work nicely what does it

455
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:18,220
mean to be incentivized means that the

456
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:21,669
mining reward has to be a liquid it

457
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,240
doesn't tell us that much but adequate

458
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:26,980
adequate means it should be Wharf like

459
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,080
waiting for a coin based mentality to

460
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,539
get your reward which means that the

461
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,770
mining reward should be higher or the

462
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:38,590
same as the real reward right and like

463
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,590
we can see that this 0.7% of Dale

464
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:44,169
transfers seems to be the rough rule

465
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,540
rule of thumb for like the adequate

466
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:49,060
security budget but you can see that

467
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,920
actually in the history it was sometimes

468
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,350
less than the 0.7%

469
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:57,190
and I think this is due to you like

470
00:24:53,350 --> 00:25:00,159
other factors because there are there is

471
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:03,100
no pool at 51% sure it's actually so

472
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,910
it'll be hard to coordinate as she said

473
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:10,090
found found out the miners had have like

474
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:13,270
huge capex that they need two immortals

475
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:16,149
immortals and like pay off in the long

476
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,400
term so they have to like play the

477
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:20,700
long-term play not just go for like the

478
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,010
individual mining cohorts but to like

479
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,590
try to go for long-term mining crew

480
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,810
boards but if it would like to break

481
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:33,850
down completely and miners would get

482
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:38,020
like 0.001 percent has happened actually

483
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:41,909
for the alt coins it would pay off

484
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:46,510
not to play nice but to actually rework

485
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:50,110
so if we might accept that this is at

486
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:53,670
least kind of true at least on the good

487
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:56,979
ready to get it through security budget

488
00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:00,640
how can we know that we won't overpay on

489
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:05,170
on drop a miners in the future and such

490
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,930
a shape like presumed or anticipated

491
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,990
anticipated these kinds of debates when

492
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:13,480
in 2010 he said like in two decades

493
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,970
there will it will be like a huge volume

494
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,880
of transactions and the fees of course

495
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:21,790
or there will be none so we need like

496
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,160
big fees in the future right so let's

497
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,800
see like where are we right now

498
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,710
like the transaction fees they are

499
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,200
nowhere like high enough it was looking

500
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,990
kind of good in here 2017 everybody was

501
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,750
pissed off that they have to pay like

502
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,660
high transaction fees but then after

503
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:44,530
segwayed it kind of broke down and right

504
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:48,100
now the transaction fees make up only

505
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:50,550
right 2% of the total security budget so

506
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,719
that that's that's not a lot right and

507
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,659
in ten in ten years

508
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,330
like that's basically the whole

509
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,030
that Satoshi talks about like after 20

510
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:06,669
years since 2010 we are going to be

511
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:09,190
about 97% of all bitcoins mind so to

512
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,440
keep the security budget adequate so

513
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,640
that it actually secures what gets

514
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,970
transferred on Channel

515
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,190
we need either of two things we don't

516
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,020
need like higher transaction fees like

517
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,940
much higher so that they make up like

518
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,780
for example 50% over the security budget

519
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:28,690
or me we need like a massive rise in

520
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:32,310
price so you can see you can ask like

521
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:37,360
how massive I'm glad somebody asked that

522
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:41,500
so I have actually made some scenarios

523
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:46,270
and I have three scenario zero right now

524
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:49,390
we see like daily transfers about two

525
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:52,570
billion dollars delivered right if we

526
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:54,070
reached like visa volumes these are

527
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,620
trends first about 20 billion dollars

528
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,649
daily so this is the second scenario and

529
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:02,860
the third one is 200 billion dollars

530
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:05,550
which seems crazy but it's only 10

531
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,169
percent of Fedwire and Fedwire is

532
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:11,139
something like Swift but for just

533
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:16,630
American banks it's a settlement system

534
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:19,210
for settling like transactions among in

535
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,790
the American banking system and they do

536
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,040
actually two trillion dollars daily so

537
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:26,320
if you just reach ten percent of that it

538
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:30,879
would be two hundred billion dollars all

539
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,760
right so what are the other variables we

540
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,330
get this adequate mining award of 0.7

541
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:41,460
percent of the daily transfers right

542
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:44,409
daily transactions I keep this stable

543
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,530
300,000 transactions which is actually

544
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:49,240
what the count of transactions today so

545
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,420
I don't presume here and any like

546
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,930
efficiency increase means in that and

547
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:58,720
block subsidy per day in 2028 it's after

548
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:02,230
to how things is going to be 200 225

549
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,720
bitcoins daily right right so if

550
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,060
transaction fees make up only 5% of the

551
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,990
reward similar to what they are now

552
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,240
quite

553
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,850
slightly higher

554
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:16,409
we would need a Bitcoin price to be

555
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:19,799
around $60,000 and fees will be $2 in

556
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:23,130
the first scenario and of course if we

557
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:26,520
need to secure more for the daily

558
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:29,669
transfers of course it will be price or

559
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:33,330
the fiend to be higher or actually both

560
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:36,720
of them right so like this is the most

561
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:41,908
crazy and I'm not saying it's going to

562
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:44,520
happen very crazy if only 5% if there

563
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:47,520
was only like 5% transaction fee like

564
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,590
make making object security budget we

565
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,110
would need like a Bitcoin price of 6

566
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:54,928
million 6 million dollars if this much

567
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,209
was transferred away all right so what

568
00:29:54,929 --> 00:30:00,210
about like if transaction fees actually

569
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,789
take over and we have like 75% of the

570
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:06,720
reward in transaction fees then there is

571
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:09,629
like much less need for high Bitcoin

572
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,960
price and of course the fees will be

573
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,909
like this so at minimum it would be like

574
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,789
$35 and the Bitcoin price wouldn't

575
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:20,789
actually rise that much all right so

576
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:25,020
it's quite fine making these Excel

577
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:28,230
predictions and how could we achieve

578
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:31,649
like a higher transaction fees I've got

579
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:34,440
some some proposals here and since it

580
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:38,668
was full of numbers and charts I made

581
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:41,100
them in like a min form so somebody said

582
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:43,830
like we should reduce the block size I

583
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,770
think it's kind of nice idea so

584
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,629
responsible bitcoiners maybe could think

585
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:51,870
about that like small block sizes

586
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:55,169
because then it wouldn't it would feel

587
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:58,139
like much easier and you wouldn't have

588
00:30:55,169 --> 00:31:00,779
liked this one set per byte transactions

589
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:04,440
but for everybody else this seems like a

590
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:07,440
pretty crazy idea and luke who proposes

591
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:12,450
this is actually called crazy for that

592
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,730
so like the other one is this is quite

593
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:17,789
easy we could make a new metric to

594
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:21,240
measure in history how long it takes for

595
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:22,250
one set transactions to actually get

596
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,470
confirmed

597
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:27,020
I use one set of instructions all the

598
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,930
time actually use it here at the

599
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:33,320
conference because that's what the green

600
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:35,780
address proposes as like the smallest

601
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,010
field that should actually get confirmed

602
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:41,240
and it gets confirmed within a few hours

603
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:44,210
so in the future it shouldn't be

604
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,550
possible to like get once one set of

605
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:49,580
transactions confirmed at least not

606
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,510
within a few hours because if that keeps

607
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,629
on happening

608
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:57,290
it means the main pool is not filled

609
00:31:53,630 --> 00:32:01,370
that much and the miners actually don't

610
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:03,680
get any reward from that all right the

611
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,600
third one is like a little bit

612
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,420
complicated so I've split it into two

613
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:12,500
memes so right now one of the problems

614
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:15,440
is you don't actually know like how soon

615
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:19,100
the transaction is going to be confirmed

616
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,870
you either under pay and what can happen

617
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,699
is that your transaction is stuck in the

618
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:25,729
mint pool for like a week or two weeks

619
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,920
or you overpay and for this single

620
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,710
transaction you pay just too much for

621
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:34,370
four deuteron section right so this

622
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:37,340
could be mitigated if we actually did

623
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:42,830
something like box based futures where

624
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:44,659
you will just auction like your place

625
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,270
for a transaction like a week from now

626
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,640
so it would be like blog space futures

627
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:52,639
right everybody's talking about like

628
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:55,160
backed and see Amy and CBOE about these

629
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,250
Bitcoin futures I think that's highly

630
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:00,650
relevant when it comes to like long term

631
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:03,170
Bitcoin economics what's more relevant

632
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:06,620
is security budget and just filling this

633
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:08,870
main pool and like book space futures

634
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,600
could be like a nice idea for that and

635
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:15,800
like blackjack and hookers is optional

636
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,730
all right so I hope I gave you something

637
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,500
to think about

638
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:24,140
I'd like to hear feedback maybe maybe I

639
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,150
am totally off the rails here but I

640
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,950
think it's kind of interesting to see

641
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:31,970
this correlation and just try to explain

642
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:34,279
it so if you want to just read some of

643
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,619
my analysis you can follow me

644
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,779
like at crypto Joseph on Twitter or a

645
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:40,728
Korean I'm actually going to write this

646
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:44,029
down after I hear the feedback if it's

647
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:47,899
like not totally dumb and it doesn't

648
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:49,820
make sense yeah so check me out check

649
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:52,029
out top monks we are a software

650
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,859
development company who do like

651
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:57,609
publishing and analysis and what kind of

652
00:33:54,859 --> 00:34:00,649
stuff we also do like tack angel

653
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:03,739
investments and check out the bank is

654
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:06,498
this like Bitcoin startup focused on

655
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:08,510
like something like we called pure

656
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:10,940
banking and we are going to have talks

657
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,159
tomorrow in the evening at the Institute

658
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:21,589
so thank you I'm looking forward to the

659
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:23,929
questions okay thank you yourself so any

660
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:35,960
hand raised for a question I see there

661
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:40,309
in the back hi thanks for this

662
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:44,029
presentation you said that what do you

663
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:50,770
think is the incentive for the miners

664
00:34:44,029 --> 00:34:55,099
not to 31% attack the network is that

665
00:34:50,770 --> 00:35:00,980
there they're making more money by just

666
00:34:55,099 --> 00:35:03,470
mining I'm I'm not agree with this I'm

667
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:07,400
thinking that they are not attacking the

668
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:11,808
network because the effect of the attack

669
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:15,319
would just simply kill the network can

670
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:19,970
you just comment on that yeah let's do

671
00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:22,730
that's like like the other measures for

672
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:25,848
securing securing the network that they

673
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:30,740
have to actually pay off the capex over

674
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:33,980
long term but like if you take a look at

675
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,450
out coins that were 51% attacked the

676
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:40,160
miners didn't care that much about

677
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:42,439
killing do not work because if it is if

678
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,049
there is like a huge discrepancy between

679
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,660
like what do miners get if they act

680
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:50,480
nicely and what they can get by

681
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:53,118
indeed change we should expect them to

682
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:58,039
go for that and we should not rely on

683
00:35:53,119 --> 00:36:00,410
them like just playing it nice I don't

684
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:03,530
think I'm not sure that this ratio of

685
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,328
the open term percent it is that number

686
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:08,839
that we are looking for but there has to

687
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:11,780
be some some relation of how much gets

688
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:14,240
transferred and by what kind of security

689
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:17,690
budget is it secured by like if you were

690
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,709
to transfer 10 billion dollars over

691
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:24,740
Bitcoin today you wouldn't want to like

692
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:29,809
wait for just six confirmations you

693
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:32,328
would need to wait for sorry you you

694
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:34,579
wouldn't you would have to wait for I

695
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:38,720
don't know like half a year because that

696
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:40,760
will be dis discrepancy or actually the

697
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,439
part you're receiving to ten billion

698
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,829
dollars in Bitcoin would have to wait

699
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,829
for like half a year I think because

700
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:52,640
otherwise for descending part a it would

701
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:56,059
be tempting to try to like organize the

702
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:01,339
miners bribe them and just try to react

703
00:36:56,059 --> 00:37:03,559
so there has to be like some simulation

704
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:07,190
of how much miners get and how much gets

705
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:10,900
transferred on chain I think that's it's

706
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:13,490
quite clear because otherwise the

707
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:16,279
wouldn't have to be a security budget

708
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:21,939
right and we will just rely on miners to

709
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:21,940
just act nice tray by whatever day yet

710
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:29,380
okay we have two more questions I see

711
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,380
first day here on the life

712
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:39,340
Thanks yeah I agree that we there must

713
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:41,529
be such a can't be too low that mean

714
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,570
there must be something that the miners

715
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,180
earn but I really didn't understand how

716
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:48,340
you get to the 0.7% because it seems to

717
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,740
me like you just divide it by an

718
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:53,680
arbitrary 144 blocks because that's the

719
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:56,680
day but why is that they come from so it

720
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:01,118
might be a month why not yeah it could

721
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:03,580
be it's well yeah I can try to calculate

722
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,740
it on a monthly basis but I think the

723
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:12,250
ratio should be the same because if I

724
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:14,379
come like calculate you know the my

725
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,480
nuclear mining crew board and the daily

726
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:20,170
transfers will be on a monthly basis

727
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,960
let's say so like you can see that over

728
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:25,210
long term this ratio stays the same

729
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,500
yeah if you if you the first way you you

730
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,210
you calculate it is is where you

731
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,070
actually calculate how much do they earn

732
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:36,700
and they understand that right this

733
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:38,890
includes the the fees and the the other

734
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,618
thing the subsidies subsidies to it yeah

735
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,180
but that's that's fine but then you said

736
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:53,050
okay that it must be this way because

737
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:55,660
it's one block in 144 and it's just I

738
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,520
don't know I find it kind of interesting

739
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,220
we find this like correlation which is

740
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,589
quite big and we see that it's

741
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,020
frightened over the five years when like

742
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:07,390
the price boom and bust happened having

743
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:12,280
happened and we had to like new miners

744
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:14,859
coming so I don't know like how else I

745
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,650
would explain it because it's like

746
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:21,640
health and culture says you have to

747
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:24,609
protect against like the reworks like

748
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,589
for like recent blocks and I said one

749
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:31,420
day it's like a good measure of like

750
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:32,830
recent time let's say all right I'm good

751
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,470
bye I'm trying I'm going to try to

752
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:39,009
recalculate it for like monthly basis

753
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:42,640
and see what comes out ok here is the

754
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:44,249
next one thanks for the presentation I

755
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,259
really like it

756
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:51,098
my question is this I think it's clear

757
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:52,390
we cannot ask a long chain for every

758
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:56,529
single transaction

759
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:58,989
I think the second layer it's a fact but

760
00:39:56,529 --> 00:40:01,359
do you think that with the current block

761
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:03,609
space we will have enough space to open

762
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:08,170
all the channels that we need for daily

763
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:10,839
basis I think if we introduced like

764
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:13,869
auctioning of future block space it can

765
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:17,130
we could actually like increase the

766
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:20,229
probability that everybody gets to open

767
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:23,140
whenever they like because it wouldn't

768
00:40:20,229 --> 00:40:26,529
be this race to just be in the next

769
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:28,450
blocks because if you are not in like

770
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:31,299
next applause box you can be you can

771
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:34,660
wait for like a week or two if the fees

772
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:37,709
are high so it would be like nice like

773
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:41,759
assurance that I don't have to like

774
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:44,140
partake in this race I I will just buy

775
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:47,799
my book space like two weeks from now

776
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,839
for some like reasonable price and after

777
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:53,769
that I will have my channel open so I

778
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:57,150
think it is going to come as as a part

779
00:40:53,769 --> 00:41:00,910
of like major rank of the system that

780
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,589
like we kind of give up on this idea

781
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,598
that the transactions have to be

782
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:08,349
included in write the next book is this

783
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:12,009
like other narrative that has been quite

784
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:14,650
wrong with Bitcoin that it takes just 10

785
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:16,239
minutes to send a transaction it's

786
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,789
completely it should be completely

787
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,680
custom how long the transaction takes it

788
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:23,499
could take like 10 minutes if you are a

789
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:28,538
trader that's doing some arbitrage or it

790
00:41:23,499 --> 00:41:31,089
could take like maybe like you should be

791
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:33,130
able to buy the book space like two

792
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:36,308
weeks from now which would be nice for

793
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:38,259
example for settling Unchained futures

794
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:41,589
or something like that then you need to

795
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:45,089
be sure when it gets settled do you see

796
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:48,430
that coming soon the the block space

797
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:51,910
features so there are the miners miners

798
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:53,319
going to allocate some resources just

799
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:58,029
for

800
00:41:53,319 --> 00:42:01,450
committing that yeah I tried thinking

801
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:05,290
about how this could come about and I

802
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:06,790
guess miners would have to might be kind

803
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:10,690
of dangerous because they they were to

804
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:15,520
have to like give some kind of pledge

805
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:19,210
that what gets auctioned gets actually

806
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,799
included right because and I don't know

807
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:23,140
how does that happen maybe with some

808
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,660
like multi-sig transaction or something

809
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,400
because we don't know who is going to be

810
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:31,509
the single miner who mines that so I

811
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,280
would like just like something that it's

812
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,140
kind of interesting maybe I've seen it

813
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,420
somewhere before I don't know if it's my

814
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:41,558
idea but I would like to talk about that

815
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:44,740
with some miners or somebody who's like

816
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:46,270
futures how this could come about if you

817
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:49,359
don't know who's actually going to be

818
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:55,809
departing who delivers that that will be

819
