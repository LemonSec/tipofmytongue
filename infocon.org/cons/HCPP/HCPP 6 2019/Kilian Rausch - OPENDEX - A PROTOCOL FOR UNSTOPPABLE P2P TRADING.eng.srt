hey guys let me welcome you to our next

4
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:34,220
talk which will be by Killian route show

5
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,070
it I don't know how to pronounce it

6
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,660
correctly yeah bye Killian yeah so

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,449
Killian has some interesting background

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,739
if you read description of the talk you

9
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:45,830
might be confused there is so many

10
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:48,019
different topics because Kelly ended

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:51,470
many interesting project in his past he

12
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:53,930
did his he did a wallet and he lived in

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,510
China for a few years but now for a past

14
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,700
2 years may ride his walk working on

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,829
something really cool can I say that yes

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,739
which is this internalize that exchange

17
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:05,810
and it's pretty cool because we all want

18
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:09,080
decent roles it change it really works

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,630
so I hope it will be it and let me hand

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:18,250
over to Killian or next speaker thank

21
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:22,039
you alright

22
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,440
today I am going to present something

23
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:26,509
which I really only managed to throw up

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:30,110
like this week so it's pretty new it's

25
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:33,380
pretty fresh and it's pretty rough so be

26
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:36,110
patient and it's called open decks and

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:41,030
it's a protocol for unstoppable

28
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:43,820
peer-to-peer trading and I want to start

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,280
with the why so which is somewhat

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,869
unusual order so I'm not gonna tell you

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,790
what I'm doing I want to start with why

32
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,580
why we're doing what we're doing what

33
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,610
drives us and what makes people like me

34
00:01:52,580 --> 00:02:01,970
get up everyday in the morning and work

35
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:04,400
on this so why because I think our

36
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,908
current financial system is essentially

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,420
flawed

38
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:12,709
who's with me here I think I'm in the

39
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:15,760
right place right I also believe that

40
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,049
bitcoin is the permissionless

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,790
unstoppable and sound money that we're

42
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:21,790
all longing for who's with me here

43
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:30,410
problem solve Bitcoin fixes this why am

44
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:33,500
I even talking right well not really or

45
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,079
at least not entirely because I believe

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,470
that the infrastructure that surrounds

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,690
Bitcoin

48
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,790
doesn't live up to this expectation of

49
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,940
permissionless and for sure not

50
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:49,079
unstoppable it's quite the opposite

51
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,520
actually because it resembles actually

52
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,020
the infrastructure that we are used to

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,460
from the traditional financial world

54
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,470
because the vast majority of trading at

55
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,850
the moment as of today is happening on

56
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,620
so-called centralized exchanges this is

57
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,970
a good solution for one and don't get me

58
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,470
wrong this presentation what I'm gonna

59
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,630
talk about right now is not about

60
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,790
bashing exchanges it's a good solution

61
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:16,590
for a lot of people actually but it's

62
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,810
not a good solution for all why not who

63
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:25,340
can come up with reasons why this is not

64
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:28,110
a good solution for all kyc very good

65
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:31,230
holding a passport from a bad bad

66
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,320
country well you're out not allowed to

67
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:39,359
open a next an account of my exchange

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:42,150
Syria Iran or have an IP address as

69
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,160
simple as an IP address from a bad state

70
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,590
even within the United States or from a

71
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:51,270
hyper regulated State anybody from New

72
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:55,650
York City here you're out no proof of

73
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:58,200
residence you're out have attained a

74
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,390
Tetris in your history of one of your UT

75
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,730
exos well in the first place you can

76
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,140
open the account but ladies then your

77
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,730
money's frozen your deposit is frozen

78
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,329
you are not allowed to use it and you're

79
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,640
out your government is of the opinion

80
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,070
that you didn't claim or declare your

81
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,029
capital gains tax correctly ladies then

82
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:20,579
you're out

83
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:23,070
no fun with tax or the most recent one

84
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,580
it would be fun even wasn't that sad

85
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,969
publish the Bitcoin wallet on github

86
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:32,640
you're out unfortunately this is indeed

87
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:36,000
not a joke I couldn't believe it this is

88
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,340
an upcoming amendment to the AML

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,820
regulations of the United Kingdom where

90
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,070
the publication of open software open

91
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,690
source software such as non custodian

92
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,950
wallet software other types of crypto

93
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,360
asset is sub suspect to AML regulation

94
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,270
you are responsive

95
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,470
bull for doing AML due diligence for

96
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:02,359
your Bitcoin wallet that you just

97
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:02,360
published on github prison scene of 2020

98
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:14,750
so the problem is simple here exchanges

99
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,750
are the control room for our governments

100
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,990
not your keys not your clients all right

101
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,789
and all true but I believe that the main

102
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,629
counterparty risks that you're facing is

103
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:32,039
actually not with the exchange itself

104
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:35,250
it's with your government I've worked it

105
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,169
in exchange before in China believe me

106
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,360
exchanges don't do this for fun they

107
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,460
don't have this kyc ever address this

108
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,039
overhead this team doing the KYC

109
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,409
actually looking at your funny passport

110
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:49,770
selfies for fun they're not watching

111
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:51,509
I've seen even new tits they are not

112
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,969
watching every trade that you do on the

113
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:57,479
system for fun or because they're run by

114
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:59,789
evil CEOs they do that because they're

115
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,310
mandated to do so by their government

116
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:04,340
and it's actually the only way to

117
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,199
survive if we have to understand them

118
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,150
anybody in the situation of a CEO of an

119
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,250
exchange with a lot of employees would

120
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,310
do the same it's the only way to survive

121
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,550
is in the golden cage with the

122
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:21,229
government you do what I say you report

123
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,729
suspicious activity you report users

124
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:25,318
suspicious users to me and I'll let you

125
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:29,550
operate and I'll have you that you have

126
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:33,210
your business profits how did we come to

127
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:36,870
accept this we of all people how did we

128
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:40,830
come to accept this having to go through

129
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,900
de facto banks to trade our Bitcoin it

130
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,940
is banks it's the enforcement arm of the

131
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,080
government to push through their

132
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:54,180
policies I'm not sure to be honest but

133
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:59,839
I'm sure that we should change that so

134
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:03,660
how do we solve it we offer a choice a

135
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:07,910
choice to trade an infrastructure

136
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:12,300
that does not ask for any personal data

137
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:15,000
on top does everything to prevent

138
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,890
actually from leaking metadata leaking

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,200
any sort of additional data which could

140
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:24,330
be tracing or which could lead back to

141
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:27,060
identifying you an infrastructure that

142
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,490
has not have any central points that

143
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,740
could be censored regulated by the

144
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,420
government or even be watched by the

145
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,560
government because there should be

146
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,750
simply too many points to be watched and

147
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,210
all that if we wanted option for this if

148
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,400
we want that to really work out we

149
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,080
cannot miss any of the convenience of

150
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,750
the speed and especially of the

151
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:53,870
liquidity of the current system what

152
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,790
does it mean that means no middlemen

153
00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:01,530
enable users to trade directly

154
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:05,270
peer-to-peer without any central party

155
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:08,400
anywhere no central party actually

156
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,900
enables what we Valiant become so much

157
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,900
the permissionless system

158
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:16,380
we don't need accounts we don't need kyc

159
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,469
no personal data at all and thus no

160
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,460
censorship and also no discriminate

161
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,880
discrimination based on your password is

162
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,299
even possible in the first place

163
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,860
no central party also enables

164
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:32,240
unstoppable because there's simply no

165
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,530
place in the system that if shut down

166
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:40,799
would cause the whole system to come to

167
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:44,069
an halt and I believe we should have one

168
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,290
open protocol that covers everyone that

169
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,260
covers a lot of use cases it shouldn't

170
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,390
be specifically made for the

171
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,300
spanish-speaking population it shouldn't

172
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,189
be specifically made for individuals it

173
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,300
should cover institutions it should

174
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:02,340
cover anyone and especially this

175
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,770
protocol cannot come from one company

176
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,360
because again this would be a central

177
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,460
point to attack a central point to

178
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,500
regulate and to censor it should come

179
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,830
from a community from a diverse

180
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,830
community

181
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:21,350
so what are we building here

182
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:23,900
open decks no surprise open decks is a

183
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,870
community run open decentralized

184
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:31,670
exchange protocol for unstoppable

185
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:34,610
peer-to-peer trading and actually we

186
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:38,990
have a role model for that the Lightning

187
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:40,250
Network maybe many of you actually don't

188
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,690
know you've heard about the Lightning

189
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,130
Network everybody is excited about the

190
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,780
Lightning Network I'm excited about the

191
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,150
Lightning Network but why is it actually

192
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:50,839
successful why is the Lightning Network

193
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:53,390
great well in my opinion it's because it

194
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,190
has open protocol specifications sound

195
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,780
super boring but these open

196
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,020
specifications to so-called bold

197
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,760
specifications which were years of hard

198
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,110
work of very smart people coming

199
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,760
together from different backgrounds from

200
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,260
different companies working together

201
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,790
hand in hand to create these

202
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,350
specifications this enabled and it was a

203
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,760
lot of emails under lightning death list

204
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,490
until this whole thing was actually set

205
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,850
up and it's ongoing to continue to

206
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:23,360
improve these specifications but this

207
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:26,570
led to what we have right now a very

208
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,000
diverse ecosystem in the Lightning world

209
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,920
we have eight implementations three main

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,960
ones and some smaller ones coming up

211
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,050
right now in rust and a lot of other

212
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,720
different languages and Counting so

213
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,380
having one set of open protocol

214
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,390
specifications and able to

215
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,030
implementations to follow this protocol

216
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:47,300
and to actually be compatible with each

217
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,880
other so that in the end there is one

218
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,630
lightning Network or not hundreds of

219
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,820
lightning that works and the real

220
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,310
benefit and the real strong point here

221
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,370
is is what's around the the Lightning

222
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,619
Network ecosystem is this strong diverse

223
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,460
community simply because it doesn't

224
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,710
belong to anyone

225
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:11,120
it doesn't belong to a company or to a

226
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:13,250
person or to an entity this is our

227
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,010
vision this is our role model which we

228
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,110
want to follow the vision is to have one

229
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:22,490
open set of protocol specifications

230
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:25,010
which is maintained by many and in the

231
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,650
future hopefully also enables many

232
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:30,110
clients many software implementations to

233
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,600
run on this protocol and for users

234
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,550
and institutions to choose from just

235
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,649
like we have right now and lightning

236
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:43,219
some prefer see lightning some prefer

237
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:46,130
L&D some run Eclair and this should not

238
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,190
only be geared towards retail traders

239
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:51,110
individual traders like you and me it

240
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:57,620
should also work for companies which are

241
00:11:51,110 --> 00:12:01,660
building on top and in the end users

242
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:04,399
have the choice if they want to use

243
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,189
Eclair on your phone where you hold your

244
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,990
private keys and you directly sign

245
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,540
transactions and send transactions or

246
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,450
you use something like blue wallet which

247
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,130
takes over the handling of private keys

248
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,230
for you and is actually a custodial

249
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,589
wallet this is exactly what we are

250
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,720
enabling here as well by making it

251
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:28,310
possible for institutions to build on

252
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,709
top of it so our goal in a nutshell is

253
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:37,459
one global trading network and one

254
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:39,260
global liquidity pool features no

255
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:40,089
central points no middleman we know that

256
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,899
by now

257
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:46,899
no kyc no personal data pretty clear tor

258
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:50,630
by default

259
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:54,380
who knows what torus Onion Routing

260
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:58,100
okay it enhances your privacy no

261
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,769
protocol token a lot of other a lot of

262
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:04,610
other networks actually make this

263
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:09,110
mistake by trying to force users to use

264
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:12,560
a protocol token in their decks famous

265
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:15,680
example 0x it doesn't work it simply

266
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,599
doesn't work it creates friction and it

267
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,670
defeats the purpose because the network

268
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,350
essentially belongs to one company user

269
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,860
control the keys at least they have the

270
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,899
choice to do so and there's something

271
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,899
now we're getting into the details local

272
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:35,500
order matching a lot of decentralized

273
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:38,720
exchanges out there are I would say

274
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,270
going out on a limb peer 99.9% are not

275
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,130
these centralized exchanges because they

276
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,670
actually running one central point which

277
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,650
collects

278
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,469
or information or the relay or

279
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:50,329
matchmaker however you may call it so

280
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,430
decentralized exchanges in my opinion

281
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,260
you should completely rename them into

282
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,209
non-custodial exchanges because that's

283
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,240
what they are but they are centralized

284
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,380
and regulation affects them at the

285
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,180
moment they are small they're flying

286
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:10,189
under the radar but in future no idec's

287
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:13,219
no real layer on 0ex will will be able

288
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,020
to offer you trading without kyc simply

289
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,280
because they are a central company

290
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,030
running a central service and that's

291
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:22,220
where the government can come in so what

292
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,709
we want is called local or emerging

293
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,810
where we are gossiping our orders and

294
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,000
peers are gossiping their orders to us

295
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,349
and we collect all of them locally or at

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,780
least the ones we're interested in and

297
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,060
then we do the matching by ourselves

298
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:38,870
locally on your note on your phone on

299
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,729
your computer and we want instant order

300
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,650
settlement I was talking about the

301
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,180
convenience and the speed of trading

302
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,640
which is a huge problem for

303
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,770
decentralized noncustodial exchanges at

304
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,150
the moment is because they're doing the

305
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,939
settlement on chain with on chain

306
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:56,240
transactions which takes minutes best

307
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:59,390
case hours worst case and cost a lot of

308
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,950
gas and is not meaningful at all we want

309
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,900
instant order settlement in order to

310
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,790
come as close to the trading experience

311
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:09,170
we are having on centralized exchanges

312
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,880
nowadays what we want on top little all

313
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,709
the little sites topic it was just

314
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,780
important for me to say we also want

315
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,400
best practices for people developing

316
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,670
implementations of the protocol to do

317
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,439
client-side checks famous example is the

318
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,849
recent vulnerability in the Lightning

319
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,700
Network itself CVE

320
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,380
I forgot the number where some all

321
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,600
implementations actually did not

322
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,939
properly check funded transaction of a

323
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,190
channel so basically I could open a

324
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,350
channel to you we would do our

325
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,360
transactions and you would not properly

326
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,250
check that you are able to actually

327
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,560
claim money out of the channel when it's

328
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,630
being closed so you would not check the

329
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,510
funding transactions properly we need to

330
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:51,080
have best practices for developers

331
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:54,490
developing on this protocol how to see

332
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,490
build their client securely

333
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,699
here's how it works we have Alice and

334
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:04,569
Bob and they're in a setup where they

335
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:08,829
are running two of these notes and Bob

336
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:12,240
has Bitcoin and Alice has died which is

337
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:12,239
a USD stable coin

338
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:20,279
Alice actually wants to buy one Bitcoin

339
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:24,089
and is offering 8,000 die now on a

340
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:26,860
separate peer-to-peer layer this order

341
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:30,249
gets propagated into the network

342
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:34,629
broadcast it and pop received it now bob

343
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:37,990
has the need to sell one BTC for 8,000

344
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:40,300
die because he needs a peasant belt this

345
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:44,050
order then enters his local order book

346
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:50,139
on his note and matches with the order

347
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:52,959
of Alice this is the full setup so

348
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:54,720
actually they are not running only a

349
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,339
nope let's call it an open decks

350
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,290
compatible note they're running even

351
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:01,540
more there's a much bigger software

352
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,849
stack below they're running also

353
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,000
lightning network clients in this case L

354
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,559
and E and radiant clients which is

355
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,859
something like the Lightning Network on

356
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:15,398
top of a theorem and they are connected

357
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:17,740
on these layers on layer 2 as well and

358
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:19,629
have channels open to each other or have

359
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,120
some sort of route where they can send

360
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:26,319
and receive payments from each other

361
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:28,629
what happens next is that Alice wants to

362
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,850
settle the order and says ok we just

363
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,520
matched you told me about a match I'll

364
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:37,570
initiate the settlement by creating a

365
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,580
so-called atomic swap thinking of a

366
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,799
secret and this is just how the concept

367
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:47,279
of atomic swaps how it works I think of

368
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:47,279
a secret and encrypt my payment of

369
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:56,679
$1,000

370
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,719
it exists but it didn't execute yet you

371
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,270
see the die did not move yet the coins

372
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,340
didn't move yet but Bob can see in his

373
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:06,450
rain client okay I have an in-flight and

374
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,449
incoming payment of

375
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,030
okay pop says I'm seeing someone who's

376
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,070
trying to pay me a thousand died I don't

377
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,139
know the secret yet to decrypt the

378
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,760
payment but I know from the order

379
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:23,910
information that I previously negotiated

380
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:26,610
with Alice that I will get it if I set

381
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:31,169
up a payment of one Bitcoin we are the

382
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:33,209
Lightning Network to Alice and then

383
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:36,780
Alice says okay I see incoming one

384
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,970
Bitcoin this is a payment I can redeem

385
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,040
with the secret I previously thought for

386
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,860
so this payment of Bob wants that back

387
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,500
of one Bitcoin from Bob to Alice is

388
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,799
encrypted in the same way that it

389
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:53,910
unlocks with the same secret that Alice

390
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:56,010
previously thought of and then Alice

391
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,919
says great that's the Bitcoin that's the

392
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:03,030
one that I want reveals her secrets

393
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:05,100
starting with a 5b and settles the

394
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:09,360
payment and in this moment only the

395
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,370
Bitcoin actually moved from a Bob side

396
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,000
of the channel to alice side of the

397
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:17,250
channel now Bob is Bob is like a thanks

398
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,520
for the secret now with this secret I

399
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,440
can redeem my dye payment on the rain

400
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,480
channel and the dye moved as well and

401
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:31,410
there's nothing Alice can do to prevent

402
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:34,440
Bob redeeming that the dye payment so

403
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:37,860
the secret is revealed the Bitcoin into

404
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:41,130
a bit current on lightning and day on

405
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:44,309
raiding payment is settled in just a

406
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,690
little little sight note here this

407
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,428
doesn't have to be a direct channel I

408
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,679
can route through any number of notes so

409
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:52,080
if you're somewhat have a channel and a

410
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,549
route with enough capacity to support

411
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,549
your trade this works

412
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:05,240
sounds like a daydream right well it is

413
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,240
not it's already working

414
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,090
okay I'm trying to demo this life is

415
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:21,620
usually always a bad idea but I will try

416
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:25,159
nevertheless okay what I'm running here

417
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,639
my computer is an open decks comfortable

418
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,680
note

419
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,080
it's called Xu D and it's developed by

420
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,490
the company I'm working for since more

421
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,850
than two years we're already working on

422
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,830
this and I'm connected to a couple of

423
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,949
other notes in the network and what I

424
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:41,449
can now do is a type order book as you

425
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,340
can see we're in the command line phase

426
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:46,820
here there's no beautiful UI yet it's

427
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,679
command line based I can see the orders

428
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,909
of other notes in the network for

429
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,550
example I can see here okay

430
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:57,320
where is it Bitcoin died well that's the

431
00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:00,520
one I'm interested in right someone is

432
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:05,629
selling Bitcoin for ten thousand USD

433
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:10,610
obviously the price of next week and I'm

434
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:13,880
now able to buy this first let's check

435
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:16,429
my balance give you guys an overview how

436
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,940
much I have so at the moment I have 14

437
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:24,500
Bitcoin I'm quite rich yeah all right

438
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:28,570
now I say simply buy one Bitcoin for die

439
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:31,730
for a price of $10,000 and hit enter and

440
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:34,010
this causes the order to go into the my

441
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,990
local order book and trigger the atomic

442
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,000
swap and it just swapped from my local

443
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,680
computer here with the other guy have no

444
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,470
idea where sitting but probably not in

445
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,330
the Czech Republic in a matter of two

446
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,620
three seconds this was the settlement

447
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,939
that we saw before

448
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,270
under lightning and then the Raiden

449
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:53,450
Network and to prove that it worked

450
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:55,930
I say get balanced again and I have one

451
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,930
become more

452
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:03,800
very proud to say this setup is

453
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,390
available on maenette since yesterday

454
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,889
that's why I was sitting very busy on

455
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,350
this couch yesterday to get all the

456
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,810
announcements out and stuff but this

457
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:14,120
works on maenette as of now we still

458
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,560
have some per trade limits in there $10

459
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:21,429
at the moment because we don't trust

460
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:24,110
ourselves that much yet but it's working

461
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:26,590
so jump back to the presentation one

462
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,590
second

463
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,180
so all that's left to say is let's opt

464
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,250
out

465
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:47,690
let's opt out of centralized trading

466
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:49,880
let's opt out of kyc and as out about of

467
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,710
your government determining if you can

468
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,270
trade with whom you can trade how much

469
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,110
you can trade what you can trade

470
00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:00,170
let's opt-out of discrimination at all

471
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:02,810
everybody is welcome and let's build a

472
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:05,060
real alternative to centralized trading

473
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:07,970
with the same convenience the same speed

474
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,860
and the liquidity and for a liquidity

475
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,830
this is actually one of the main

476
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:15,439
prospects and vision that we have with

477
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:18,649
another company is to actually bring

478
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,360
exchanges onto this network as well that

479
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:25,220
exchanges can provide and use the

480
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:28,370
liquidity in the network as well and we

481
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,020
need help open decks literally I just

482
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,419
threw up the website I think on Tuesday

483
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:35,570
and I'm currently we are two people a

484

00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:47,120
technical writer a community manager or

488
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:50,750
a trader that tests notes that gives

489
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,060
feedback on the protocol join us website

490
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,580
is available here I opened a telegram

491
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:58,790
group this morning this is I think is

492
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:01,280

00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,200
especially technical writers get them in

496
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,730
there the first draft of the

497
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,620
peer-to-peer protocol specifications is

498
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,830
online since this morning as well so

499
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,389
we're currently using the we're

500
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,310
currently using the implementation that

501
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,780
already exists that you saw running here

502
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,520
which is called Exedy developer the

503
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,590
company I'm working for as like a

504
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,440
template this is where we derived the

505
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,270
current protocol specifications from and

506
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:34,059
then build on top of that and improve

507
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:43,509
from there that's it thank you

508
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:44,908
Oh No thank you any question thank you

509
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:48,549
for the presentation

510
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:52,059
have you thought also in the protocol or

511
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:54,369
for future abort let's say the second

512
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:59,158
use case of the centralized exchanges

513
00:24:54,369 --> 00:25:02,918
and that is exchanging with the fair yes

514
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:05,469
yes yes this is not solving the Fiat

515
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:08,289
on-ramp problem obviously not filmed on

516
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:10,809
ramps digital Fiat on ramps will always

517
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:13,389
require a central point and will if it's

518
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:15,219
not illegal always require kyc we are

519
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:16,359
not solving that problem here I have to

520
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:17,769
be very clear on that sorry I should

521
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:21,999
have said that before like very clearly

522
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:25,749
this is not solving it but I believe in

523
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:28,330
the future where you have to where you

524
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:30,700
have the choice of multiple Fiat on

525
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,639
ramps at the moment I really don't want

526
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:36,219
to know but I'm guessing 90% of the Euro

527
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:38,918
against Bitcoin trading goes via feed or

528
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:44,080
bank in Germany that is bad we should

529
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:46,719
have more choices to get our euros

530
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,779
somehow into Bitcoin I'm thinking of an

531
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:51,460
approach like local bitcoins an approach

532
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:55,089
where the Fiat transaction itself

533
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,580
actually goes from peer to peer people

534
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:59,889
have two other companies hopefully maybe

535
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,408
you want to start working on this an

536
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:06,998
innovative ways how to get from actual

537
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:09,279
Fiat electronic Fiat into Bitcoin we

538
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:11,289
will not try to solve that this is the

539
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,719
protocols it's basically assumes that

540
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:15,609
you're somewhat encrypted already it can

541
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:16,929
be a stable coin it can be your stable

542
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:20,499
core and use these stable cornered and

543
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:23,229
able to to trade back and forth but Bank

544
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:24,549
Fiat is not solved here the pretty cool

545
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:28,059
products though I think they were

546
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:31,629
released two weeks ago one is from spark

547
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:33,519
swap a company from San Francisco which

548
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:37,178
enables you to run like a desktop client

549
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:40,539
and for the Americans among us you can

550
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:42,369
wire them we are a CH some US dollars

551
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:44,440
and they will open the Lightning channel

552
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:47,409
back to you and push over these amounts

553
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,670
so basically you go from an ACH wire to

554
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,710
open lightning channel that you actually

555
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:53,100
can loot you use and I think there's

556
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,990
also balanced in a matter of minutes

557
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:59,500
second company is from check Miller's

558
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,790
SAP they do similar thing at a moment a

559
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,130
little bit restricted to the American

560
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,379
market but there will be more coming so

561
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:08,680
there will be more and more on ramps

562
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,750
coming basically on the edge of the

563
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:17,440
network how you can get your Fiat into

564
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:19,510
into Bitcoin here thank you very much

565
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,620
can you talk a little bit more about

566
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:25,840
front-running

567
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:27,370
and also about partial order yes both

568
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,000
very important topics partial order

569
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,699
filling works

570
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,670
I can even demo it if you want so

571
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,200
basically it will just it will recognize

572
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:37,180
in your local order book how much is

573
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,910
available of the quantity and then just

574
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,380
swap that amount and the rest of the

575
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,780
order it will enter it into the order

576
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,090
book and broadcast it to the peers so

577
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,920
partial order of filling perfectly works

578
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,560
just like on a normal regular exchange

579
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,500
second thing front-running

580
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:55,629
very valid topic and i have to admit our

581
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:59,860
current peer-to-peer protocol is not

582
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:01,630
running on tour yet the settlement layer

583
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,490
is completely running on tour how notes

584
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:07,420
find and connect to each other is also

585
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:10,000
running on tour but when messages

586
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,620
traverse you basically need a direct

587
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,390
connection as of now and this definitely

588
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:17,350
has to change and this is why we need

589
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:20,670
help where you can actually measure the

590
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:22,929
time that a packet needs to a specific

591
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,940
peer that you're connected with and

592
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:27,430
we're currently we haven't get up if you

593
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,750
open in our Exedy repo and someone

594
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,410
started actually working on it and

595
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,990
there's a proof-of-concept

596
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:35,680
implementation for that and it's called

597
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:38,560
tor th o r and this feature allows you

598
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,110
to measure the ping times that i have

599
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,690
with all my peers and then take the

600
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,820
longest one and basically delay sending

601
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,340
all the other orders that i have in a

602
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,409
way that they approximately arrive at

603
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,439
all my peers at the same time and this

604
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:54,280
prevents from trying so we thought of

605
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,640
front-running there's a proof-of-concept

606
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:00,310
implementation there if it works in

607
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,560
practice i have no idea but

608
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:04,240
concept is there and the basic principle

609
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,850
we are following us I have to know how

610
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,640
long information needs to travel from me

611
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:12,730
to my peer when I know that I can delay

612
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,380
the others to make it that all orders

613
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,630
arrive at my peers at the same time and

614
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,070
then there's no possible limit very very

615
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,050
very limited possibility of

616
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:24,970
front-running

617
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:26,379
very good question Paul right yes so I

618
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,700
was really interested in your goals of

619
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,620
achieving the same level of performance

620
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,510
and liquidity a centralized exchanges

621
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,570
but running that you're given that

622
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:36,550
you're running all of the order matching

623
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:39,040
locally per client I'm wondering if

624
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:40,840
you've done any measurements as to how

625
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,300
much bandwidth would be necessary to

626
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,740
keep an up-to-date order book on a local

627
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,629
client-side device especially like on a

628
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,180
phone just because order matching

629
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,860
engines are the thing that you know even

630
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,870
the centralized changes exchanges

631
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,169
struggle with to have a very high

632
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:59,399
performance yeah we did not run any

633
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:02,440
real-world tests on that so far

634
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,200
reason for that is we wanted to make it

635
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,510
work first and the second reason is I

636
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,610
think you will create your own little

637
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,650
few of orders that you're interested in

638
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,330
I think it's not realistic that you will

639
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,980
have the world's orders on your phone

640
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:17,020
and that your local matching engine in

641
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,680
your phone does matching with the

642
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,300
world's orders I think it's more

643
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,160
realistic that you have used the ping

644
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,200
measurement function that we have to

645
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,270
actually only receive orders from peers

646
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,100
that are close to you or close enough to

647
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,170
you that you actually have a chance to

648
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,969
be there in a reasonable time and fill

649
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,710
the order you will only receive it for

650
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,590
order pairs you're actually interested

651
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,790
in all these years a 22 years a 20 pairs

652
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,129
you might not even want to see them

653
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:45,250
right so you will filter the order book

654
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:48,580
like extent like in an extreme way so

655
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,890
that you narrow it down to a couple of

656
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,050
hundreds of orders actually and then

657
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,300
even low-end devices should be able to

658
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,010
make it to answer your questions no we

659
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,690
didn't do any any performance tests on

660
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:02,440
that yet it's definitely working on a

661
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,790
phone we use you need to especially to

662
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,970
run may not actually you need a quite

663
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,230
beefy computer because you need an a

664
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,530
theorem full client for that and that's

665
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:13,510
not fun to set up and so with these

666
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,020
beefy computers it works like a couple

667
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,280
of hundreds of

668
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,110
water is a couple of thousand of orders

669
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,620
we tested that works we didn't go any

670
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,620
further than that

671
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:26,770
another question about scalability so is

672
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,810
it I guess I'm in competition with other

673
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:31,270
people trying to grab that same order so

674
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,200
if I see an order I want so question my

675
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,670
scalability I mean is there a problem

676
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,910
that I can always just basically never

677
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,590
execute because I keep getting

678
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:40,240
definitely beaten to the order by by my

679
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,669
peers whereas in a satellite plot I'm

680
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,680
just in a queue and sooner or later

681
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:47,110
exactly that definitely can happen as it

682
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,030
is designed right now it probably let's

683
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,189
say we buy tomorrow you all start

684
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:53,889
sinking my net nodes and by tomorrow we

685
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,410
have 500 users probably this will happen

686
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,680
to you so the protocol is not prepared

687
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,510
for that yet and that needs to change

688
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,070
how I envisioned it how it will become

689
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:06,580
is that you have different trading

690
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:10,480
strategies that you will not go for the

691
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,770
optimum of the order book for peers

692
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,010
whether you see where they're coming

693
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,540
from

694
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:16,629
you know these orders from this peer I

695
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:19,060
now have a ping time of 200 milliseconds

696
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,700
to this peer it is not realistic that I

697
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,200
among all people will actually get that

698
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,570
order so that different trading

699
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,850
strategies actually help you to go for

700
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:31,899
an order that is realistic that you

701
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:34,389
realistically can get so this is not the

702
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:37,960
thing you want to use if you're looking

703
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,760
for the best market price beating the

704
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,310
rest of the market because you're not

705
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,870
competing with the rest of people of

706
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:48,520
Drakon you're competing with the rest of

707
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:49,590
the world so you want to use this as a

708
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,110
spot trader

709
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:56,080
to exchange for a given price let's say

710
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:59,320
10000 USD and there are is there's a

711
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,530
huge offer of 10000 USD for one Bitcoin

712
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,750
in in this system that's where you want

713
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:07,180
to use our system of where you can where

714
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,650
you can exchange high-frequency traders

715
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,320
I mean think about it

716
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:13,780
this system can never be as fast as a

717
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,820
centralized system it's it's as simple

718
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:18,850
as that it's it's physics it's distance

719
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,649
between between notes so we probably

720
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,969
have to work with certain trading

721
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,820
strategies where you go for different

722
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:28,170
orders and others where probabilities of

723
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,169
how likely it is

724
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:32,820
can you explain in more detail how they

725
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,950
atomic swap itself and actually they

726
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,260
like the exchange of the secret is known

727
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:40,560
so that it can be completely trust less

728
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:43,530
yeah so that's the very reason why this

729
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,510
whole secret revealing process exists in

730
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:47,700
order to make a trustless um it is not

731
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:50,100
very different from a regular lightning

732
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,340
transaction actually wherein a lightning

733
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,469
transaction actually the secret is

734
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,050
traded by the receiver then hashed and

735
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:02,040
invoice is created and me as a sender I

736
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:03,960
pay this invoice and then the payment

737
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,520
can be revealed can be executed by

738
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,680
revealing the secret it's the same

739
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,480
principle so we have a very strict

740
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,190
protocol and we're in our protocol

741
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,770
always that always am a kind of taker

742
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,929
right so someone is always first and the

743
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,580
protocol knows how to determine that so

744
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,060
people have to agree and to make you a

745
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,029
taker

746
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:26,940
it's always the taker doing actually the

747
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:28,680
first the first payment so in that case

748
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,020
actually alice is doing the first

749
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,270
payment and alice is the one that takers

750
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,820
always the one who controls the preimage

751
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,530
with things of the preimage hashes it

752
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:41,280
stores it away and then encrypts the

753
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:42,740
payment of $1,000 this hash to Bob it's

754
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:49,440
always like this and never changes and

755
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:52,109
then Bob knows that if he creates

756
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,240
another payment with this particular

757
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:57,060
hash and that means this payment can be

758
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:59,220
decrypted with the very same secret that

759
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,350
Alice previously loosed sending it back

760
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,720
and then Alice is able to successfully

761
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:06,450
actually make this payment execute by

762
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,060
revealing the image and by revealing the

763
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:11,490
image just as a technical detail here

764
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,710
when Alice reveals the image on the

765
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,770
lightning channel here pop automatically

766
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,690
knows just take it as as that right so

767
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,940
Bob automatically gets the secret from

768
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,040
Alice in the moment she reveals it on

769
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,500
the on this channel and then Bob can

770
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,960
just go and input it here basically fill

771
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,990
in the blank of the dye payment to make

772
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,750
it execute as well so the in one

773
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:36,689
sentence how is it trustless it is

774
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:40,260
trustless because both payments are

775
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,040
triptych rapidly bound together by using

776
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,670
the

777
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,220
same secret that makes them execute so

778
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:49,350
we spin we set them up first we set the

779
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:53,040
payments up first and then once the

780
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:57,420
secret is really revealed both execute

781
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,850
simultaneously so to speak sorry

782
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:07,980
you only know it Alice knows the secret

783
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:10,740
exactly kind of clear so explanation of

784
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,120
this yeah I made thousand hundreds of

785
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:16,259
flights regarding this I can send them

786
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:18,120
over to you another question

787
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,970
uh we discussed the feature of the

788
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:24,180
central Rose ostriches as you know for

789
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:26,069
also for the fire earth fiat money there

790
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,520
is another critical aspect of those

791
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:33,210
centralized exchanges that is so working

792
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:37,230
with the OTC transactions if you address

793
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,550
that also or I will elaborate it for the

794
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:44,400
others do you know Odysseys

795
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:46,080
over-the-counter yes but didn't really

796
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,290
think about it but I've troubled to

797
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:52,560
really applying it here because what OTC

798
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:54,900
means is it's one central place I can go

799
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,110
and I can get a guaranteed price for a

800
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,670
huge amount of money that's there's a

801
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,590
secondary aspect of this feature and

802
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,720
that is that this transaction actually

803
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:07,680
or actually the willingness to do the

804
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:11,910
trade it's not put onto the you know

805
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:15,089
trade book basically that it's like a

806
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:17,520
private private way of doing that so uh

807
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:22,620
I would call it in famous Oh because it

808
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,450
actually you know it it the it is not

809
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,730
reflected on the market basically so

810
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,460
it's heavily used by the funds what you

811
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:31,140
can do all right I'm just improvising it

812
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,120
right what you can do is if you want to

813
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,400
have something like a dark pool kind of

814
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,740
functionality for having like large

815
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,210
orders to execute via the network which

816
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,370
out affecting the price because people

817
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:44,640
don't know about it right you could do

818
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,470
that by selecting the peers that you

819
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,170
want to be able to decrypt your order

820
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:51,089
information so I'm default each order

821
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,000
information is actually encrypted in a

822
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,180
way that only the peers I'm connected to

823
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,520
can

824
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,810
decrypt and read my order information so

825
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,790
what you could do is you could select

826
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,560
the peers that are able to read your

827
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,650
order information and you will only be

828
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,029
able to trade with these and execute

829
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,620
with these peers all the rest of the

830
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:10,830
network does not know about your order

831
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:14,819
at all period that's what you could do

832
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:16,710
and try to execute a large order I would

833
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,450
say but it's a bit of manual work by

834
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,400
selecting which peers can see it which

835
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,960
peers cannot but having it completely in

836
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,970
the dark is not really possible because

837
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:36,570
you can only trade with people if people

838
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:41,910
know what do you want to trade so you

839
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:43,950
choose which one to see the the Amazo

840
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:47,129
you want to trade so it's like a private

841
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,899
sub channel something kind of this isn't

842
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,480
a separate layer so we have we have

843
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,700
three layers here number one let's call

844
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,680
it the unchain layer layer one Bitcoin

845
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,750
full node like current full nodes Gath

846
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,450
full node horrible by the way then we

847
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:02,580
have layer two where we have led a

848
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:05,520
lightning client and Raiden the rain

849
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,350
client to open channels on a theorem and

850
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,110
then we have layer three this thing here

851
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,460
opened X and opened X has a separate p2p

852
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:13,410
layer where order information is

853
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,000
exchanged so yes if you restrict the

854
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,770
order information to always be read by

855
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,480
the certain people you won't be able to

856
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:21,420
read it's like a private channel only

857
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,860
the counterparty knows that's that's

858
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:32,250
what I tried to describe for the for the

859
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:34,770
OTC any other question so this seems

860
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:37,500
like very complementary to something

861
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:41,630
like bisque which is kind of I think

862
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:44,250
they got their start with Fiat and

863
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:46,860
Bitcoin it's not quite an atomic swap

864
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:51,870
obvious reasons but they've since moved

865
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:54,540
into crypto - Krypto I think just I mean

866
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:57,750
if you're looking for you know client

867
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:00,330
developers and such I mean they probably

868
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:02,850
want to talk to them yeah I think this

869
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:06,270
could be really a really you know cool

870
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:07,890
tool to have for them as a way to do you

871
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:14,309
know atomic swaps at least

872
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:21,779
they're crypto the crypto pairs but I I

873
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:25,019
do have a question so so with the with

874
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:28,079
with the with the order book is you did

875
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:29,308
you say there it's a it's a broadcast as

876
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,279
a global broadcast what kind of

877
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:34,230
everyone's seeing all of the orders and

878
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:37,170
you said you could potentially even

879
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:40,109
restrict it down to specific pairs that

880
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:43,260
your your interests one it's like to all

881
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:44,690
or to pop key one two three four that's

882
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,400
what he can do

883
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:52,140
as of now maybe there are more ways to

884
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:55,559
restrict it somehow but and so like

885
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,578
right now I with a lightning wallet like

886
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:58,349
I have a lightning wallet it's

887
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:01,170
non-custodial but I don't have to run a

888
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:03,359
full note there's some node running the

889
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:07,619
cloud I think it might even be an SP V

890
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:09,930
client it have you thought about the

891
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,200
potential of you know users not having

892
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:15,240
to run full nodes necessarily but maybe

893
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,950
it's a pain in the ass I'm using SPV or

894
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,720
connecting to a trusted note somewhere

895
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,779
yes definitely that's one of the next

896
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,700
steps between in order to increase the

897
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:25,109
UX of that whole system at a moment it's

898
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,390
full notes because it's the obvious

899
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:30,359
choice it's for the real self sovereign

900
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:31,828
individual yes good place to start good

901
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:33,359
place to start exactly that's where we

902
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:35,549
are right now as I mentioned it went

903
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,529
live yesterday right but the next step

904
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:39,660
will be use your existing full node

905
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:41,339
maybe some of us already running Bitcoin

906
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,259
full notes a lightning Bitcoin full no

907
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:45,869
combination you will be able to reuse

908
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:48,690
this one by the way it's regular L&D

909
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:49,920
zero point seven point one zero point

910
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,019
seven point one has all the features we

911
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,259
need to do our secret or top secret

912
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:56,729
reveal atomic swap thing rating the same

913
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:59,579
we've worked for months with the rain

914
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:01,529
team to include all the secret reveal

915
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,569
and injection function into raid and in

916
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:06,119
order to do that as well so you will be

917
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:08,009
able to use your official rain client

918
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,440
official Gath client and the official

919
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:12,089
stack on top of that of course it should

920
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,109
also work with light client and it will

921
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:18,619
neutrino for L&D and there's also a

922
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:21,240
light client for Aiden worst case

923
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,840
connect to in flora I'd really don't

924
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,819
recommend

925
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,170
but that's the simplest way to get up

926
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,120
and running with a light client when the

927
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,520
theorem that work so yes we thought

928
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,150
about it and it will be possible great

929
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,150
thank you so much

930
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,330
quick question what's your business

931
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,970
mobile it sound like you develop this

932
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:41,220
inside a company so so they're two

933
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:43,350
things straight so open Dex is a

934
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:45,660
community it's not a company there's no

935
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:47,490
business model I'm doing that on

936
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,259
Saturday evenings Tuesday nights

937
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:51,750
whenever have time with a friend of mine

938
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,490
that's why we need help we need urgent

939
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:56,070
help because we don't have the bandwidth

940
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:58,589
to do that next to our day-to-day jobs

941
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:00,450
then there's a company which actually

942
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:02,130
developed the first working

943
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,779
implementation of this protocol and

944
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,490
actually where the protocol comes from

945
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,630
so we did code up the protocol first and

946
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:09,270
then started writing the specifications

947
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,890
as of now with open Dex

948
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,330
it's called exchange Union that's what I

949
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,490
work for and there's a business model

950
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:17,450
the business model is selling services

951
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:20,220
on top of this this can be for example

952
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,480
opening a lightning channel to you so

953
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,459
that you're requesting a balance

954
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,280
lightning channel to you to get you up

955
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:29,550
and running with one deposit and so that

956
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,040
you don't have to manage opening a

957
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,810
channel yourself for example so there's

958
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,050
a business model basically selling

959
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:38,820
services on top of it but that's not

960
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:43,430
open text open Dex is a nonprofit

961
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:47,210
community one more question

962
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,210
ok the last one

963
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:57,390
so there are possibility to make fake

964
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,130
orders or do they contain like a

965
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,350
cryptographic proof that you actually

966
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:06,180
own the coins and I'd already verified

967
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:08,160
by every node yeah client-side why it's

968
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,589
wise yes but of course you can just

969
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,000
change the code and make the checks go

970
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,740
disappear right so we have checks in

971
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
place with you we don't allow you to

972
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,700
enter an order if you don't have a

973
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,410
lightning channels open with minimum

974
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,509
this capacity right so this is a local

975
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:23,430
check but there's just simply no way for

976
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,650
another node to verify that you actually

977
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,240
have this outgoing capacity in order to

978
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:31,290
support the amount that you traded so

979
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,729
yes there's a way to fake orders very

980
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,170
interesting topic though there's not

981
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,790
only fake orders there's a lot of other

982
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:37,830
fake things that you can do in a

983
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:39,600
permissionless system like this and I

984
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,950
believe the answer to that is actually

985
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,589
is something called reputation

986
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:45,839
reputation not associated to your name

987
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,390
don't be afraid reputation associated to

988
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,010
your public key so your public key is

989
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:52,740
your one and only identifier and this

990
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,810
whole network and it should have a

991
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,209
reputation score attached at least for

992
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:59,130
you locally you can say okay I received

993
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,350
one fake order to fake orders three fake

994
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:03,420
orders from this very pop key probably

995
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:05,279
this guy is doing some malicious stuff I

996
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,260
give him some negative reputation score

997
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,330
next time I enter an order it's less

998
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,430
likely that you will trade with this

999
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,779
particular pub key in order to really

1000
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,620
get through with that the only thing

1001
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:19,290
that we need to ensure is that creating

1002
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,970
a public key is expensive that someone

1003
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,560
cannot just come up with new public keys

1004
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:25,560
all the time all the time in order to

1005
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,620
actually mitigate that so there will be

1006
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,990
probably a combination of creating a

1007
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,940
note which creates a public key and with

1008
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:35,100
you having to deposit some security

1009
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,320
deposit into some sort of smart contract

1010
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,720
which is associated with your public key

1011
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:43,950
other nodes then can verify that you

1012
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:47,129
indeed the deposit this amount of eronel

1013
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:48,960
die or ETH into a smart contract which

1014
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:51,000
is linked to your public key once you

1015
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,340
have that so okay this public key is

1016
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,320
expensive I start doing reputation with

1017
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,910
this guy so this is kind of the way

1018
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,190
forward how to deal with these attacks

1019
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:01,020
you cannot prevent them they will happen

1020
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,569
the only thing you can do is you can

1021
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:07,979
limit the trading activity

1022
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:09,449
you have with malicious people okay well

1023
00:46:07,979 --> 00:46:10,210
thank you so much Gillian for her

1024
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:16,719
presentation

1025
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:16,719
