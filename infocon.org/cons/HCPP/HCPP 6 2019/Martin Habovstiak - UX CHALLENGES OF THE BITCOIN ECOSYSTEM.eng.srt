1
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:36,149
so thank you for coming to intern at

2
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:38,489
Institute of krypton our hey maybe we

3
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:47,339
can rename it to Internet of Krypton our

4
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:51,239
key of martín hub of check and Martin is

5
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:54,239
also also came in from parallel nopales

6
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,419
Bratislava which is second existing

7
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,070
polish right now in the world and we

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,839
hope more is coming if you are

9
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,960
interested in these like crypto

10
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:06,740
communities which arise also I can say

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,810
thank to project of para una police

12
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,210
definitely don't miss panel discussion

13
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,460
which will open a Sunday program in the

14
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:19,199
main hall so definitely come here

15
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:23,419
insider in the morning and Hubble start

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:28,079
programming when he was 11 as far as he

17
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:30,480
said and he's very much into security

18
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:34,259
cryptography Bitcoin and he's a

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,350
freelancer and outer several of Bitcoin

20
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,960
and lightning related application we

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,190
just talked that he was also present at

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,289
the blast comet workshop which is the

23
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,590
project which res deals in para una

24
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,200
pelea para una police prac and it's a

25
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,100
project of lighting Network ATM machine

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,170
and I think that the hub of share with

27
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,080
them some some very interesting areas

28
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,400
and right now he will talk about you

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:08,489
exchanges of the Bitcoin ecosystem so

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,780
Martin its forgers thank you

31
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:16,019
a welcome here I'm very happy to be here

32
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:19,349
again this year for the sixth time for

33
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:25,170
me yeah I've been here every time so

34
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:27,739
that's so not waste time as you heard

35
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,329
I'm from Panama police

36
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:34,670
and since I mean from Paulo Napoles I

37
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:37,190
experienced firsthand the issues and

38
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:41,630
challenges that no new bhai's

39
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:43,820
experienced and I've saw them and so old

40
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,600
all the things that they have to go

41
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:50,540
through and and since I was there from

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,829
the very beginning I have about the year

43
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,739
of experience and I think there is a lot

44
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:02,690
of information that is valuable and that

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:06,650
should be shared so in order to show you

46
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:11,329
what what it's like to be a new by in

47
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:13,040
Palomar police this is how our parallel

48
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,190
policing that I saw looks like from

49
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,579
outside as you can see it's small but

50
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:25,310
one grew maybe I'm not sure so this new

51
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:30,320
by comes to palana police and approaches

52
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:36,410
the cafeteria where he is explained that

53
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:41,109
there is no Euro accepted and you know

54
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:43,340
like what the oh you just script oh

55
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,570
don't worry it's fine we have

56
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,340
professional crypto apostle's that will

57
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,750
explain to that they will help you

58
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:58,580
create your wallet buy your first crypto

59
00:03:52,750 --> 00:04:01,820
and buy your first stuff crypto and some

60
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:05,870
people even try to like convince us like

61
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:09,140
yeah but just take the cash and I would

62
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,600
make the world later they would never do

63
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:17,209
it later if he accepted the cash stocks

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:19,880
you have to reject it so let's say that

65
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,599
this new buyer doesn't dis decide to

66
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:27,070
turn around and decides to install the

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,919
load so we would instruct the new buy to

68
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:36,530
go to play store or

69
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:38,719
well do Google Play or App Store and he

70
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:44,539
tries to download Evolet and what

71
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:47,990
happens in few cases so unfortunately

72
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:51,020
this is the reality of like not like two

73
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:54,800
minutes I would say it's fine that like

74
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,590
there is people who have this issue like

75
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,379
there is not enough space so first thing

76
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,960
if anyone of you is creating a wallet

77
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:06,080
please don't don't think that oh

78
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,180
whatever users have a lot of storage I

79
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,639
don't care

80
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,370
BMPs are fine they wrote faster and so

81
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,789
on please don't please really try to

82
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,340
look at the Oracle at your data if it

83
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:22,729
can be compressed if there is any

84
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:27,438
optimization that you can do for it to

85
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:29,960
be small it really could help like you

86
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,789
they don't eliminate this problem at all

87
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,219
but at least decrease the likelihood

88
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:36,229
even better but fortunately this is not

89
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:39,279
a huge problem

90
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:46,190
there is much worse problem and that is

91
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:48,949
there are 24 verts so why would I write

92
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:52,069
any forwards are you kidding me

93
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:56,599
we brought so much in school but never

94
00:05:52,069 --> 00:06:00,020
mind just 24 words is too much so there

95
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:03,438
are two things first thing is we pretty

96
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,599
much have to you know there are tons of

97
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,610
wallets and we have to decide which

98
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:10,750
wallet to recommend and there are tons

99
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:14,870
of parameters and advantages and

100
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:17,900
disadvantages and so we concluded that

101
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:21,620
the economy was the best at the time

102
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:25,279
because out of all coin supporting

103
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:29,839
wallets it except it supports both

104
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,879
Bitcoin and coins and also out of

105
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,389
all of such wallets

106
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:38,539
it's the most reliable but it creates

107
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:42,440
fixed 20-word seat

108
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:44,810
why 20-word seat anyone is cryptographer

109
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,280
here or have any idea about crypto

110
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:52,910
rafi perfect I can okay I can explain

111
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:57,260
this so if you calculate the entropy

112
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:59,690
like the security of 12 volts and 24 you

113
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,560
will find out that twelve words is

114
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:06,590
equivalent to 128 which is currently in

115
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:11,270
cryptography like I would say lit

116
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:13,869
standard that key this large is good

117
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:18,560
enough it's good really really secure

118
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:22,820
it's extremely hard to brute-force 128

119
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:29,030
bits you may her hear about 256 bits but

120
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:30,950
it's just over born its 256 bits are not

121
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,179
that important but why this very

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:38,419
standard that allows for 24 words so the

123
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:41,090
history is that when tresor guys were

124
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:44,719
creating the first world hardware wallet

125
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:47,869
they needed to came up with some scheme

126
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,770
to pick up the wallet in user friendly

127
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:54,830
way and so they figure out they could

128
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:57,890
spit out the words but when they restore

129
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:01,340
the word the user has to enter them via

130
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,400
computer so in order to defend against

131
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:08,810
any attacks the wallet mixes the words

132
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,179
randomly but if you have less than if

133
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,270
you have like 12 words it's just 12

134
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,120
factorial which isn't sufficient to you

135
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,219
a chamber but 24 factorial is sufficient

136
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,750
to a large number so that's why they

137
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:26,720
pick 24 words but for as you can see for

138
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:31,250
non Hardware roll out for for mobile

139
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:34,760
wallets overkilled it's not needed so it

140
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,200
would be and I'm like a paranoid person

141
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,640
using cubes is the most secure operating

142
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:43,550
system but I'm also that this is too

143
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,569
much this doesn't add security so really

144
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:49,310
decrease the security actually original

145
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,000
practical security which decrease the

146
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,599
number of words to 12 it's good

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,830
and like it still is like okay I have to

148
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:04,000
rewrite some words but visually it's

149
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:06,970
totally different like it's how it feels

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:14,290
feel severe to write down 12 words for

151
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:18,760
me you like it's hurtful so that's the

152
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:23,650
first thing another thing our ATM so

153
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:31,270
once he figures out how to how to set up

154
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:40,360
the wallet he approaches this ATM so if

155
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:44,620
you noticed this so what happens if you

156
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:48,940
attempt to do this because did this

157
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:52,180
mistake so long time ago not so long

158
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:55,930
time ago there was the issue where this

159
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,449
worked and the issue was that the wallet

160
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:02,199
didn't know about incoming transaction

161
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:07,360
so the ATM did send light coins to

162
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:10,480
Bitcoin address and then we found the

163
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,880
recovery procedure that we optimized to

164
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,030
be fast enough but it still takes our

165
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,370
time and it's painful and the user is

166
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:21,819
confused and scared and whatever so

167
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:25,060
please make sure to not send two wrong

168
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:28,060
addresses also another problem after

169
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,359
fixing that was the ATM didn't say

170
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:35,800
anything about was wrong QR code it just

171
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:38,290
stays there and you can try you can

172
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,969
create you can try different angles and

173
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,660
it still doesn't work and the a team

174
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:47,350
doesn't say like what the hell but

175
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:52,060
fortunately yeah and the other thing I

176
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:55,240
forgot to mention the there is a piece

177
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,400
of glass and the camera is inside so so

178
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,980
if the camera is pointed at piece of

179
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,800
glass and you are supposed to hold the

180
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,059
phone against the glass but since the

181
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,098
grass is too clean

182
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:10,269
don't notice and try to insert the phone

183
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:14,629
into the course so that's another like

184
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:18,349
like they find out eventually but it's

185
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:20,389
not very nice and you might think that

186
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:23,569
those people are stupid and they really

187
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:25,519
feels like stupid but many many many

188
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:27,439
people do and even smart people try to

189
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,909
insert the phone into the glass because

190
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:31,819
they don't see it and they don't realize

191
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:34,129
that the camera is in the bag they think

192
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:36,709
it's on the top and there is no way for

193
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:41,329
them to tell because they are higher

194
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:51,319
than this so this is interesting problem

195
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:55,429
but just funny stuff so fortunately

196
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:58,189
these days if you try to do it if you

197
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:00,978
use the correct angle and the address is

198
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:05,299
Bronk you get this message which says

199
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:08,359
error address is not valid for LTC great

200
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:14,468
great that they upgraded it after a year

201
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:17,479
no not exactly but yeah thank you

202
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:21,399
manufacturers of this ATM for fixing

203
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:25,789
this problem helped us a lot actually

204
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:28,249
like those cases where people send dough

205
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:32,419
to ROM Gregory's there I think there was

206
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:36,949
about 10 people in in a year so maybe

207
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:40,789
one month then right coin is oh

208
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:45,139
coin so the user waits a long time like

209
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:48,348
from anywhere from minute two to five

210
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:51,409
minute there was some weird issue that I

211
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:53,959
experienced recently and there is no one

212
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:55,519
else that seen it and I'm not sure if

213
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,039
there was a problem if the network

214
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,589
connection of or with whatever basically

215
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:04,309
someone bought litecoin and it didn't

216
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:06,979
confirm in one hour and then suddenly it

217
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:10,039
confirmed but when I looked at the book

218
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:11,989
exper later to show like what the hell

219
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:15,109
is happening like there are two books

220
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:18,139
one however a part I didn't see any so I

221
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:18,710
don't know what happened something

222
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,260
strange

223
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:24,320
because I verified independent to end

224
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:27,920
blog exported that there are no such

225
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,600
books and suddenly there were so I don't

226
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,160
know maybe there was some kind of a

227
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,790
taken I could but maybe I I somehow

228
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,709
screwed up something or I don't know so

229
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:43,520
this is hard to say what happened so a

230
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:47,300
light cone is too slow unfortunately for

231
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:51,290
many people actually oh and let's say

232
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:55,189
that he just bought coffee he is now

233
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:58,160
happy and wants to pay and then find out

234
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:03,050
he doesn't know he doesn't remember the

235
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:07,459
password to the vault on the phone so if

236
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:09,500
he was lucky enough to realize that the

237
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:14,390
backups are really important then he can

238
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:16,820
recover the world and if he wasn't wise

239
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,860
enough then he will be very very sad

240
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,930
because there is no way to record this

241
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:29,180
and this happened once from all this

242
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:32,630
time and maybe for this i really

243
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:36,050
recommend for wallets to detect whether

244
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:38,090
screen walk is configured which is

245
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:42,469
possible on Android on jail OS it's also

246
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:45,290
possible so on Android you can detect

247
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:48,170
this and if the phone itself is locked

248
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:51,469
there is no additional security gained

249
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:54,650
from requiring an additional password so

250
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,810
don't ask for password there it is more

251
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,569
likely that people will forget the

252
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:02,810
password and will be stolen

253
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:06,200
there was no theft during the whole year

254
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:09,920
but one was password so statistics

255
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:13,070
doesn't don't lie but we have statistics

256
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:19,189
from wider sample so don't worry about

257
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:19,730
this and maybe if there is no lock on

258
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,920
the phone

259
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:26,990
don't push person into creating passport

260
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,709
photo wallet really recommend him to

261
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,060
like walk the phone it's better it

262
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,440
basically if there is any malware that

263
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,319
can

264
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,800
read the storage the dead malware can

265
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,950
screw up with your wallet so much that

266
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,290
possible we will not help you so no

267
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:48,130
security and for arch amount

268
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:50,349
please use hardware roll it but this is

269
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,780
done the experience but there are other

270
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,300
screw-ups that whom I come up with this

271
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,939
is like even this is kind of optimistic

272
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:02,349
path where the person was explained that

273
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:07,590
use Konami's very good wallet like I

274
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:11,950
mean very stable wallet and the reliable

275
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:14,770
there was like one reality issue the

276
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:18,400
whole year but there are other bullets

277
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:21,280
and now I will have to criticize

278
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:25,240
publicly some very very bad bullets and

279
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,860
the disco enemy Konami is not just

280
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,250
Bitcoin wallet but coin wallet as

281
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,740
well and as a promoters of coins

282
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,260
they sometimes promote Bitcoin as a

283
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,420
payment by the way it's it sounds

284
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,250
strange that I I don't promote bit

285
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,860
candle payment but talk about this

286
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:44,170
because I think that bitcoin will become

287
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,090
a method of payment in the far future

288
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:49,360
but not now

289
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,010
but Cohen Bay is like right now beacon

290
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,580
for payments and coins are faster

291
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:57,760
better whatever but they provide so

292
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:00,550
shitty user interface for payments that

293
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,710
this doesn't make sense so what's the

294
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,459
shitty about coins because if you want

295
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:08,709
to scan QR code with with address and

296
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,350
amount you have to enter the amount

297
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:14,589
first and there is no way around it like

298
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:17,349
what the hell you need to manually type

299
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:20,438
in the amount then you scan the QR code

300
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:23,500
which already has the amount and then if

301
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:27,550
you messed up the amount I believe the

302
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:31,330
last time I checked it takes your amount

303
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:35,010
do you enter so you send the wrong

304
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:37,360
amount and it will go to hell so

305
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:42,190
convinced is total if you want to

306
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,659
pay basically since I don't believe in

307
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,940
state regulations

308
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,720
I believe in feedback and in

309
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:52,510
market I need to publicly criticize best

310
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,880
projects for doing bad things because

311
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,040
there is no other way without government

312
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:02,440
interventions and there are other

313
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:04,360
stuff happening I for example in the QR

314
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,200
code there can be encoded address and

315
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,479
amount but also only address and the way

316
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,850
the others and the amount are encoded is

317
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:18,400
a special thing that looks like URL and

318
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:20,110
so what a wallet I don't know the name

319
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,360
of the wall that I'm pretty said that I

320
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:28,060
cannot like publicly criticized again

321
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:32,320
but unfortunately just try it out before

322
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:35,800
before you go out to pay if you want to

323
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,409
be sure it would somewhat do wish so the

324
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:42,879
problem with which this valla did was it

325
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:45,250
scanned the URL as the one thing and put

326
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,650
it in the address field did realize that

327
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,810
the address is Bronk and it said like

328
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:53,440
from hangar address but it's not the

329
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:55,659
address it it's code B IP to anyone

330
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,970
basically the wallet don't does which

331
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,550
doesn't support B IP to anyone which is

332
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:04,810
the like the most important payment

333
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:08,050
method just don't Co it payment wallet

334
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:11,379
it's 'seed-wad so let's talk about

335
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:14,409
whitening network and how it can be

336
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:19,510
solved is here anyone who doesn't know

337
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:23,280
what's whitening network at least ok I

338
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:26,440
think I could skip this part with or

339
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:32,020
does anyone feel like he wants me to

340
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,640
repeat okay okay so let's let's say you

341
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,670
want to join a whitening network so you

342
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,400
we want to transact with someone the

343
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:42,670
basic building book is so called payment

344
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,440
channel and so so it's some kind of

345
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,660
smart contract where you deposit

346
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,600
bitcoins or the other party deposits

347
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,330
bitcoins and then you can spend from

348
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,480
this channel to the other person we

349
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:57,320
basically update bonds if I put one

350
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,020
Bitcoin in the contract

351
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:03,590
and later I say that I want to give you

352
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:06,830
how Bitcoin I will update the bonds that

353
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:10,250
I have half you have health and later I

354
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:14,389
can update balance again and again maybe

355
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,500
the other way and so on so we are it

356
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,790
screwed up okay

357
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:27,070
sorry where it screwed up during the

358
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:33,610
conversion of format display

359
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:37,820
anyway you can like move this around and

360
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:40,790
that's the basic building block and the

361
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:44,629
dairy its guarantee that once you move

362
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:48,470
this you cannot you know utter all week

363
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:51,110
this to take the amount back or whatever

364
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,140
you can close this channel so if the

365
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,699
other party is not cooperative you can

366
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:59,630
broadcast the transaction we've lost

367
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:02,390
state if you attempt to broadcast

368
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:05,110
invalid transaction you all your money

369
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:09,500
will be taken from this contract so

370
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:12,290
don't do that there is also enforcement

371
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:17,300
or that you have to have something to

372
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:19,310
lose all the time but this is the main

373
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,570
building book and what is the lightning

374
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:25,940
network-wide it's called network well if

375
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:30,980
some people have channel with the same

376
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:34,250
person one person can send to the other

377
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,260
person via middleman and it is

378
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:39,500
guaranteed that this middleman cannot

379
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,890
steal the payment or cannot somehow

380
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:46,940
overcharge this person was the fees in

381
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:49,970
advance so he can send basically the way

382
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,280
it works is he can he sends a bigger

383
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,680
amount and here it is somewhat small

384
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,860
amount which I'm the difference is the

385
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,460
fee that this person charges and since

386
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:06,879
there is a low barrier to entry there is

387
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:09,440
incentive to keep fees reasonable so

388
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,180
this is the Lightning Network and why

389
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,440
I'm talking about this

390
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:19,940
you remember the guy was seeing his

391
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:23,450
watch so there is this first problem

392
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:27,170
with whitening network is you still have

393
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:29,330
to wait for the key when you are opening

394
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,070
the smart contact it's normal book

395
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:35,480
change transaction and you have to wait

396
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:38,659
for it so there is no way we could do

397
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,720
this in polymer Poly's so we were

398
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,670
thinking like is there any way around it

399
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,010
like what could be done

400
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,320
you like that nada I had a talk about

401
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:51,440
this also on about economy but you roll

402
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,870
out the year and later after after his

403
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,360
conference he talked to me and I was

404
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,379
like yeah we should solve it and we were

405
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,780
thinking after several unsuccessful

406
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:05,030
ideas even than outside and then I was

407
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,830
thinking thinking thinking and there is

408
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,720
one interesting thing in the whitening

409
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,990
network protocol that is implemented

410
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,390
already and that's when opening a

411
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,740
channel you can give away the amount to

412
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:22,100
the other party immediately so you can

413
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:24,020
you can transact in as one operation so

414
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,649
this is nice before exchanges or

415
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:30,410
whatever so you if you buy from atm it

416
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,920
can open channel to you do and or you

417
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:36,110
will have already a balance there but

418
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,980
you still have to wait for book change

419
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:43,159
so no solution there but I realized if

420
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:47,210
I'm already trusting this machine that

421
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:51,500
when I inserted the bills it will or

422
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:55,340
even send me any anything then it's not

423
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:58,400
a problem for me to like trust it and

424
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,010
then actually the machine doesn't need

425
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,890
to trust me because of the way the

426
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:07,610
contract works there is no trust

427
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:09,679
involved from that part so there is no

428
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,409
nothing actually preventing me from

429
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,500
spending this channel outside of the

430
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:19,070
protocol like officially in the protocol

431
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,650
it made this that way that both parties

432
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,139
have to wait but actually there is no

433
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,290
reason for this limitation so I was

434
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,110
thinking about

435
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:31,889
I realized there needs to be some other

436
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:36,320
work done I will skip this this part

437
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:40,200
maybe but when this work was done I

438
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:44,040
realized like so close to implementing

439
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:49,110
it so close okay so I wrote about it

440
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:51,360
somewhere on github and one guy thought

441
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,419
that it's good idea I am implemented in

442
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,639
his wallet and maybe some of you read

443
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:01,620
this article did anyone read this out

444
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:04,500
Rico great yeah so an article came out

445
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,449
that bitter if you created a new kind of

446
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,750
service where you can buy this channel

447
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:13,760
and spend from it instantly and yep

448
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:16,920
here's my name in the article basically

449
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,080
bitter if you decided to make business

450
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,660
out of it which make me very happy

451
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,629
because it means that my idea makes

452
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:27,809
sense and there will be other people

453
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:30,270
implementing it and maybe hopefully more

454
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:33,330
bullets and hopefully Paula Oppel is

455
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:35,570
will be able to use that and what kind

456
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:39,360
of all let's just support it today

457
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:41,879
lightning Lord which is the lightning

458
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,500
bullet I use mainly because of this

459
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,050
feature but it has some other nice

460
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,250
features I all like it unfortunately

461
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:52,530
only for Android sorry Jos devices so

462
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:57,030
anyone has Android here and wants to try

463
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:59,550
it out do you want to install it you

464
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:02,850
have it okay so here's a little

465
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:05,550
competition for you so the way to do but

466
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:08,189
she knows work in order to for it to be

467
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:10,740
user-friendly you use can kill you don't

468
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,440
show anyone QR code you scan QR code and

469
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,510
the wallet asks the service for a turbo

470
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,490
channel so here is a little competition

471
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:25,710
for you prepare your wallets and when

472
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:28,470
you slide right to scan QR code you can

473
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:33,620
scan special QR code which is this and

474
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,620
whoever scans it first gets an Satoshi's

475
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:40,370
hopefully it will work

476
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:43,160
invalid sikri did someone else do it on

477
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:46,250
the way sorry if there is another secret

478
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:50,720
that means either that some stuff stole

479
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:54,770
it on the way or or someone or or maybe

480
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,380
some of you was the first one any anyone

481
00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:05,299
here recognizes themselves as being the

482
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:07,640
first did it open a new channel yeah

483
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:10,549
great congratulations we want the

484
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:14,770
competition so now you can go downstairs

485
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:19,190
and get some coffee with this so this

486
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:22,520
thing we I will try to be quick so you

487
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:24,950
can like rush there before it confirms

488
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,260
it still one Satoshi's per byte so maybe

489
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,690
maybe you will be lucky so basically I

490
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,940
would like you to feel the experience of

491
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:35,090
paying with an come from channel it

492
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:38,630
would be nice or maybe if you feel like

493
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:42,980
that's great idea you can try to use my

494
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:45,559
special website when - ask me where you

495
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,049
can post any question about Bitcoin or

496
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:50,720
programming and when you click ask you

497
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:55,220
get lightning invoice for 30,000

498
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,260
satoshis and you can try it that way so

499
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,390
if you pay it I will see it in my

500
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,929
interface eventually and dive you answer

501
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:08,559
it eventually unfortunately not when I'm

502
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:11,150
busy now so you can expect that I

503
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,299
depending on the difficulty of the

504
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:17,330
question I should answer if it will be

505
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,179
something very easy I will answer today

506
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:23,418
if it's something very hard I might

507
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:25,760
answer on Monday because here at

508
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:27,980
conference and also I have other stuff I

509
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,740
will not have much time for hard

510
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:34,270
questions sorry about it but it's that's

511
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:36,710
all about user experiences so I think

512
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:39,918
this would be the best way to onboard

513
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:42,260
new users and there are things that this

514
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,080
wallet does very well

515
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:49,700
it doesn't have any password at all oh

516
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:52,639
it has twelve Verte it's very

517
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,950
reliable like I pay with this wallet in

518
00:28:52,639 --> 00:29:00,529
Panama bodies and it's like two seconds

519
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:03,860
all the time the only cases where it was

520
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:08,240
about two seconds it was about 40 and

521
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:11,479
that was when I had misconfigured my

522
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,120
note and it caused solace but then I

523
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,429
improved the configuration and bring it

524
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,299
down to two seconds oh great

525
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:22,190
also I managed to pay in one second here

526
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:24,440
like it's probably historically first

527
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,750
time so my wallet knew about the

528
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,380
transaction happening much much much

529
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:32,630
before the terminal here which is funny

530
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,320
because receiver always knows about

531
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:38,899
lightening transaction before the sender

532
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:43,879
like the receiver knows that it's it

533
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:48,049
happened before the sender but still

534
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:52,309
somehow the answer came back to my phone

535
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:55,908
faster then it came to the to the

536
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:58,190
terminal so it's it's funny so it's

537
00:29:55,909 --> 00:30:01,970
really fast and should work in cafeteria

538
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:04,010
and also you for your channel I think

539
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:07,549
you should have some receiving capacity

540
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:10,789
as well in addition so if you will by

541
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:12,559
some other bitcoins or you should be

542
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:15,889
able to receive but only after your

543
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:19,279
channel confirms of of course so it's

544
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:23,049
all for this I hope you enjoyed it and

545
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,049
I'm ready for questions

546
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:31,829
there is a question yes we have

547
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:34,829
questions thank you for your talk and

548
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:34,829
questions

549
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:40,509
did you try and if you tried what do you

550
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:41,619
think about the user interface of the

551
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:44,829
briefs wallet

552
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:49,478
yeah briefs is like I would say it's my

553
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:51,729
second-favorite wallet I even I would

554
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:54,759
say it's difficult to say which is

555
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:57,339
better because again British is great

556
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,059
because it has just one balance that's

557
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:00,759
awesome

558
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:02,009
oh they automatically open channel to

559
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:05,649
you awesome

560
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:07,869
they have integrated swaps with own

561
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:10,958
chain even more often like this is

562
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:13,149
throwing really great so what I'm

563
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:15,579
missing there is turbo channels because

564
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:17,889
when you install brace you will have to

565
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:20,289
still wait for the channel to confirm

566
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:22,508
for the opening channel they use pretty

567
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:25,419
good fees so maybe these 10 minutes but

568
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:28,749
if you need to do what we are doing in

569
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:31,209
parallel polish there is no way to wait

570
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:33,239
for even for those 10 minutes that would

571
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:36,909
be even sword and the going so

572
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:39,129
unfortunately but the breeze wallet guys

573
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:42,009
said somewhere that they would like to

574
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:45,428
implement turbo chinos so if they

575
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:48,549
implement it there is a one good news is

576
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:51,729
the police is a variable for oj always

577
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:53,859
as well so oh yeah I save just because

578
00:31:51,729 --> 00:32:01,629
it's like going to jail very secure but

579
00:31:53,859 --> 00:32:03,279
you don't have any freedom so this is a

580
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:07,629
variable for all users that would be

581
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:10,090
also awesome so there breeze is really

582
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:12,459
really great what I'm

583
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:15,669
I'm said about it doesn't have seat

584
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:17,950
fries and the reason like we could go

585
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:21,370
with some small password or whatever I

586
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:23,380
look out for small amounts we still say

587
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:27,030
to people that don't put large amounts

588
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:30,040
into mobile phones but we still want to

589
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:32,250
require seat because of one thing and

590
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,680
that it's trying we want to train people

591
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:38,440
into better security in at least in some

592
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,410
way because otherwise they could clear

593
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,530
up so we we decided that this is wart

594
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:49,090
wart it like at least those 12 words

595
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:51,430
it's fine so we learn how how it works

596
00:32:49,090 --> 00:33:00,340
and it's standard and supported in many

597
00:32:51,430 --> 00:33:02,290
volt so it makes sense i full disclosure

598
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:05,649
i coordinated welcome of a wallet and

599
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:07,210
applications browser and on a protocol

600
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,000
that has state channels with smart

601
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,560
contracts and them so sanchez payments

602
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,650
I'm gonna ask you a question I ask

603
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,000
myself all the time you know you

604
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,320
mentioned all these struggles that we're

605
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,510
currently going through like people

606
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,389
can't really you know they're just

607
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:24,129
flabbergasted by this thing and on the

608
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,110
other side we're hoping that it's gonna

609
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,760
be used more widely than just you know

610
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:31,000
people that attend events like this one

611
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,890
what are in your opinion the biggest

612
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,660
challenges and some of the solutions to

613
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,780
actually getting people that are regular

614
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,820
people to to use crypto not just for

615
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,970
payments but also for things like this

616
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:47,560
or for applications that run on the

617
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:49,480
blockchain good question I had I was

618
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:53,710
struggling with for convincing people

619
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,500
like they were asking me questions like

620
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:59,200
why should I use crypto like why Android

621
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:02,110
why why should you use crypto to let you

622
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,870
freedom if freedom is not interesting

623
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:07,719
for me or something and I came to

624
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:10,179
realize that there is one specialty

625
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,340
about Bitcoin and something that it

626
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:14,230
focuses on and then its store of value

627
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:17,650
use case and it's really really

628
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:20,080
important part of money and if I say to

629
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:23,500
people like your money is being invited

630
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:27,969
away and there is the heart of money and

631
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:30,310
harder that nobody can invite but there

632
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:33,189
are there are very few people knowing

633
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,918
about it and more and more are

634
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:37,450
understanding in coming in and as more

635
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,629
and more people understand it and

636
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:42,899
economic incentives and everything is

637
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:46,659
pushing more and more people to adopt

638
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:48,489
harder money history tells it what

639
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:53,800
Bitcoin standard book is great at

640
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:57,160
explaining it so just use it to get rich

641
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,320
on basically and like I'm I'm not giving

642
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,098
any guarantees like I always say like it

643
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:06,730
could fail even if I cannot imagine any

644
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:10,330
more for you all these reasons like how

645
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:13,660
it could fail exactly but still it could

646
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:15,940
fail so don't put there so huge amount

647
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:20,310
of money that you would kill yourself

648
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:23,800
for losing on something but this is

649
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:26,410
currently at least in Slovakia in Czech

650
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,150
Republic in similar countries

651
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,399
this is currently like the most

652
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:33,880
reasonable use case for most people and

653
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,250
there will be some people who need to

654
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,730
buy something special on dart market

655
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:43,480
maybe or in that just in different

656
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:47,410
country where where there is very slow

657
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:50,619
banking connection or maybe they need to

658
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:52,598
buy an account on the gap social network

659
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:53,859
or something similar they will need to

660
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,670
use it and maybe if there is

661
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:58,180
dictatorship in in sake or somewhere

662
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,820
else

663
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,970
they will have to use it just like in

664
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:06,760
Venezuela it's saving their eyes maybe

665
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:12,129
so these are the like video you have to

666
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:14,980
be like intellectually honest and that's

667
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,839
the real reality that for other people

668
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,960
just don't care about anything else than

669
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:22,119
maybe getting richer and this is

670
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,910
actually some good value proposition and

671
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:27,670
one day when everyone has it then there

672
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:30,819
is no problem like ok I do not like so

673
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:33,849
one Bitcoin for I don't know how many

674
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,040
billions of inflated coin called

675
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:39,640
euro or maybe door and

676
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:41,470
and they've about buyback that the work

677
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,029
because if the other person already

678
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:45,910
accept it okay fine

679
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:48,970
and yes I like look forward to it the

680
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:52,720
user experience of this is huge it's

681
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:54,700
like paying in Panama police is much

682
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,580
much better than with everything else

683
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:00,520
there is no change I don't have to carry

684
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:02,880
huge who already in my pocket I have

685
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:08,650
phone all the time with me

686
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:12,310
it's crazy fast it's cheap I don't have

687
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:15,550
to fill out this how much for so I

688
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:23,920
really look at it I want it but I must

689
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:25,930
say we are not here thank you so let's

690
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,770
say that recognization event would

691
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:31,750
happen what functions or criteria with a

692
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,430
lightning what we have to fulfill to be

693
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:38,140
stupid proof on the level that it will

694
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:39,069
prevent massive loss of user funds good

695
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:44,350
question

696
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:48,670
well I think makeup is current weakest

697
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:50,799
point for you bit proof because I can

698
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,750
pretty much imagine pretty well for

699
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,850
everything else to be stupid proof like

700
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:57,690
this wallet automatically buys

701
00:37:54,850 --> 00:38:01,990
Watchtower services for you so that's

702
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:04,240
under the interesting and so on so on

703
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:07,120
the lighting network level this wallet

704
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,330
the bitcoin I think whoa that is stupid

705
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,390
proof I would say like I really cannot

706
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:16,720
imagine any way for for you to funds

707
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:19,660
with this wallet except if the other

708
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:25,060
person is stupid and since the white

709
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:27,160
Condor of course and but the backup is

710
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:30,370
the weakest point currently and I had

711
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:33,250
this crazy idea and maybe some hardcore

712
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:35,770
safe banks will try to throw rocks at me

713
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,570
now but I had this idea that maybe there

714
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,480
could be special function where you

715
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:46,500
insert a special device into the jack

716
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:49,349
and it will send over the seed world and

717
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:52,109
what would be the device and the head

718
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:55,710
idea that it could be Porter where you

719
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:59,819
like see directly that the wires go to

720
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:02,549
transistors driving driving stepper

721
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:04,249
motors and droving these seats on the

722
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:06,390
piece of paper I think that's

723
00:39:04,249 --> 00:39:08,999
technically possible although maybe

724
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,589
sounds crazy and something to do to

725
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:12,598
empower police and not somewhere else

726
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:17,999
but something that would be really fun

727
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:20,460
and help our users but I I don't think

728
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:23,430
this will be ever implemented but maybe

729
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:26,279
some other way to do this so I think

730
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,649
this is the weakest point because I

731
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:35,460
really like I really don't know how you

732
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:42,479
could measure with this robot okay we

733
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:45,630
have two questions I see so I had a

734
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:47,460
question about the turbo channels so I

735
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:50,700
understand these are useful in a

736
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,190
situation where a trust is okay so it's

737
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:58,169
not a trustless in the way trust is

738
00:39:53,190 --> 00:40:03,359
always okay I mean every trade is trust

739
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:05,519
if nothing is atomic basically yeah is

740
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,619
there some point in the future where

741
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,410
this channel becomes trustless or is it

742
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:13,229
basically stay where it's always trusted

743
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:16,170
but it doesn't matter because even now

744
00:40:13,229 --> 00:40:19,410
like you insert bill into machine and

745
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:21,960
you trust the machine to send you points

746
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:24,868
on chain whatever you always trust it

747
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,499
actually turbo channels are more safe

748
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:31,469
than the old-school version and why it's

749
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:35,009
I think it's mostly academic but still

750
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:38,759
fun because the moment you spend from

751
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:42,690
turbo channel in this moment you

752
00:40:38,759 --> 00:40:44,759
decrease your risk because if you put 10

753
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,400
euros and you have 10 euros worth of

754
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:48,150
bitcoins and now you buy a coffee for

755
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,019
two-year-olds

756
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:54,630
you have only 80 or risk because it's

757
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:57,899
already spent those two euros so if and

758
00:40:54,630 --> 00:41:00,299
if you wait the more you doing girl wait

759
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,270
the bigger risk is that there's

760
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:04,100
something screwed up

761
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:06,470
and the transaction doesn't get

762
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,900
confirmed because the guy that was pens

763
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:11,540
or the he gets Hecht and the person

764
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:15,380
detect him double spend or something

765
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:18,560
the longer you wait the more you risk so

766
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:22,670
therefore this is safer than the

767
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,620
old-school version that's well I mean

768
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:26,780
with an 8-month you know like two year

769
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,819
olds like screw it if it's unchain of

770
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,850
course it is trustless once it confirms

771
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:35,390
yeah the moment the channel is confirmed

772
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:38,420
you don't do not longer trust the other

773
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:40,040
person so so you buy oh by the way I'm

774
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:43,400
also selling this tool but you know that

775
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:46,279
the way I I generated this QR code so if

776
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,640
anyone wants to try out we can make a

777
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,920
deal and so it will trust me to not

778
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,440
double spend this opening transaction if

779
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,970
you don't trust me and have you you can

780
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:01,640
rush to cafeteria and buy tons of coffee

781
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:04,250
but if if you trust me just wait for it

782
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,129
to confirm I always open live once at a

783
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:09,620
cheaper bite why because that's the way

784
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,020
I can be profitable because for people

785
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,750
who are receiving this way they don't

786
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,150
care about the time because they don't

787
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,820
have to wait so so you're saying once it

788
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:24,160
confirms its trustless yeah that's

789
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:27,830
exactly what my question was it's okay

790
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,980
yeah and if it doesn't confirm there are

791
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:34,460
two options either I was either I am

792
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:37,640
asshole and we won't refund you or I or

793
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:41,240
something technical up and then I

794
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:47,629
will refund you or video make some deals

795
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:49,100
so yeah so you would just resend the

796
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:51,410
transaction if it falls out of the

797
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,960
member laughter into 72 hours yeah maybe

798
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:56,540
that's what you do most people okay I

799
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,550
mean like I don't automatically check

800
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,820
for this because it basically never

801
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:07,100
happened like once a to shipper by

802
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:09,320
transaction just work if I ever have

803
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,839
problem if that I will solve it and then

804
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,660
I will also add some code to it by the

805
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,370
way if you want to sell these two Bochy

806
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:22,120
knows you need

807
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:25,390
for Claire and we will need to have this

808
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:29,259
front end to sell these channels and I

809
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:31,299
published the source code so just hit me

810
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:35,040
after the talk if you want and I will

811
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:38,140
give you a row or maybe four four how

812
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,850
would I describe this link which is

813
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:44,890
pretty strange for Watchers of this talk

814
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:48,520
basically if you google my my name and

815
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:51,160
get happy you should be able to find my

816
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:54,690
profile and then search for my whitening

817
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:57,310
project I would say maybe so that's its

818
00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:00,880
possibility so I published the code to

819
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:02,380
create these QR codes and give give them

820
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,110
away of course you have to have some

821
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:07,030
kind of server or something

822
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:08,440
thanks for inventing tor channels I

823
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:11,410
think it's a great great contribution

824
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,210
I'm very happy also I wanted to ask if

825
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,879
how long have you been accepting

826
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:19,510
lightning here in parody ponies in

827
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:23,170
Pomona in virtue so I had here I think

828
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:26,290
it was from beginning of this year all

829
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:29,520
right we have some experience yeah of

830
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:33,009
course like I have experience with

831
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:36,250
managing channels and stuff there is

832
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:37,870
some other stuff I could talk about if

833
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:39,910
you are interested yeah that's what I

834
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:43,029
was asking about us

835
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:44,410
how often does it not work how magically

836
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,840
it works every time

837
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:49,750
if someone makes to boot you know to my

838
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:52,570
note well sure make really sure that my

839
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:55,590
note works it's very connected to palana

840
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:57,930
police and so on and so on like it

841
00:44:55,590 --> 00:45:01,830
worked every time

842
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:06,359
unfortunately for other wallets

843
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:10,630
it's not uncommon to fail and there is a

844
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:13,800
funny thing is that there are custodial

845
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:16,630
bullets which try to appear to be like

846
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,870
yeah so whatever you have like small

847
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:22,119
amount and it it's not a problem and the

848
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:25,259
many channels for you you don't have

849
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:28,539
you don't care but the problem is when

850
00:45:25,259 --> 00:45:31,660
someone has somehow broken wallet or

851
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:35,019
something and the world is not custodial

852
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:37,779
I can tell them like okay show me the

853
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:40,328
log so let's work it out we will find

854
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:42,430
out which not cause these I will I to

855
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:44,319
disconnect the channel or rare is the

856
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:47,440
fee to discourage this route or

857
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,058
something and we will solve this but if

858
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,180
it's cultural they are all that I have I

859
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:55,839
know nothing and I have no way to make

860
00:45:52,180 --> 00:46:00,640
sure it works in case of breeze by the

861
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:03,990
way I made a connection there server and

862
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,879
then swapped out some bitcoins so

863
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:09,910
basically that's how I rebound it this

864
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,190
is really a really nice feature so if

865
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:15,129
you have breathe it should work reliably

866
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:18,849
like maybe it might try other nodes

867
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:22,150
because I had to set these for the

868
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:25,930
channel to somehow get back the cost of

869
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:29,049
opening it and rebalancing but if

870
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:32,140
everything else fails it should go

871
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:36,369
through my channel hopefully and also I

872
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:39,249
opened channel 2 to this terminals here

873
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:41,079
so you should be able to pay from if you

874
00:46:39,249 --> 00:46:47,109
are connecting my note you should be

875
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:49,450
able pay here as well thanks okay I

876
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:53,200
think we run out of time we need to get

877
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:53,618
ready for the next presentation so thank

878
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,480
you mother

879
00:46:53,619 --> 00:47:02,670
thank you thank you and thank you

880
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:02,670
[Applause]
