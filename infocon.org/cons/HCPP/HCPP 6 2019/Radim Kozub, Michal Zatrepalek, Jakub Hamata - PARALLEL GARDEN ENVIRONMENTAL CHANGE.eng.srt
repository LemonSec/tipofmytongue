[Music]

2
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,780
so maybe you have noticed recent

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:38,650
discussion about global environmental

4
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:42,250
problems yes some did I would like to

5
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:46,570
welcome here local guys from project

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:51,570
pearl Garden who will bring a little bit

7
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:54,879
different answer to questions rised by

8
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,570
environment movements who mostly address

9
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:02,019
their requests to governments and big

10
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,089
corporations but pearl garden will try

11
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:08,860
to show a little bit different approach

12
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:13,080
to environmental challenges which was

13
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:20,430
built on Farrell Polly's values and

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:24,700
principles which don't rely on central

15
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:28,060
central authorities or big entities and

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:31,780
try to solve global problems but focus

17
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,750
on what we can do now and here pearl

18
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:38,649
garden is also very I would say like

19
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:42,759
flagship projects of parabolas program

20
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:46,719
because they do great lectures regular

21
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:50,320
and via meetups but I also do lots of

22
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:55,048
physical stuff they built Hedra pony ass

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:59,889
farm boats and they develop with very

24
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:02,380
straight forward vision of of some

25
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,619
development they are going to introduce

26
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:11,519
you in today's lecture so I would like

27
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:11,520
to welcome on stage radium CO soup

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:21,920
redeem kazoo is a member of boards let's

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,490
say of our legal association that is

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:29,079
interface to the state purposes

31
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:33,680
interface to the state to be able to pay

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:37,490
rent and these things so redeem as

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,730
co-founder of blockchain legal and and

34
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:44,450
professional attorney covers the legal

35
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:49,010
issues then I would like to work on my

36
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:54,440
house at the Pollack who comes to the

37
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:57,459
stage with us guy with background in

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,540
mining tries to implement his

39
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:04,610
experiences from mining in environmental

40
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:11,420
problems and solutions and the last one

41
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:14,360
is yaqoob mamata and the ercoupe is kind

42
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,859
of a science geek who is a professional

43
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,590
in landscape creating gardening and

44
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:27,830
biology in white sense of its word so

45
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:29,840
guys I passed Mike and please thank you

46
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,030
very much for introduction and good

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,360
evening everyone thank you for coming

48
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,690
for our presentation tonight I guess the

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,049
reason you're here is you were somehow

50
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:44,120
interested in environmental topics

51
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:47,480
you probably think how could someone

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,880
think he can change such complex and

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,579
global topics from scratch and maybe

54
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,340
you're also interested like how parallel

55
00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:00,110
garden project is connected to parallel

56
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:02,450
nopales and what exactly is it tonight

57
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,239
we would like to share our story with

58
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,510
you simply and the reason why we are

59
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:12,140
doing that is you would like to give you

60
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,920
a cookbook the cookbook how to start a

61
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,620
parallel project may be parallel startup

62
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,798
so you would like to explain what is it

63
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:26,330
a parallel project actually and what was

64
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:28,250
our path until today and

65
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:32,169
what are the principles what are the

66
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:35,270
specific installations and steps we did

67
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:37,909
so let me start with the maybe a little

68
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:41,930
bit of theory and theoretical part and

69
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:47,930
we will get more and more specific to

70
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:50,650
the towards end big problem issue this

71
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,360
was in the beginning of our project

72
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,330
probably all of you have something like

73
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,469
a big problem something you feel it's a

74
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:05,210
big problem let's say global one for us

75
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:08,750
the big problem was unsustainable

76
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:13,068
approach agriculture wasting of Natural

77
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:16,300
Resources but also one specific issue we

78
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:18,759
had and this was a very unsophisticated

79
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:24,319
way of mining cryptocurrencies

80
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:26,780
especially not using the huge amount of

81
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:32,180
residual heat that is coming out from

82
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:35,630
the mining so we were looking for the

83
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:41,419
solution how to deal with that and like

84
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:45,620
what can we do actually for big problems

85
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:49,490
what is similar and what is common for

86
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,729
them is definitely there mostly global

87
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:57,529
they cause some mass harm or at least

88
00:05:52,729 --> 00:06:01,849
the threat of it and they usually breach

89
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:05,840
your fundamental values you have also

90
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:10,400
the usual needs a big solution so for

91
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,169
example if the truck hits your house so

92
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,359
it's broken it's destroyed you have to

93
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:17,180
repair it you have to contact insurance

94
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,150
companies so on if the hurricane hates

95
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,529
Heidi for example or Florida it's

96
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,580
completely different stories completely

97
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:29,750
different solution you need to take but

98
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,340
this example has one advantage because

99
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,310
if you have something like a catastrophe

100
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:38,239
you already know what the results are

101
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,889
you already know what happened so you're

102
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,039
looking for solution

103
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:45,740
on something the new you know what is it

104
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:50,419
like you have to solve the existing

105
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:54,259
problems the problem of most of big

106
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:58,878
global problems is that we're actually

107
00:06:54,259 --> 00:07:02,689
not so certain of them there is usually

108
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:07,279
some some social consensus to a certain

109
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:09,889
extent but on the other hand not all of

110
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,949
them is like the global on not for all

111
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:18,379
of them it's everyone agree with that

112
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:22,759
and the scientific findings are just

113
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:28,759
part of this consensus so is it really

114
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:31,189
that big the problem if environmental

115
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,279
issues Arabic problem it's actually

116
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:38,589
maybe the most complicated big problem

117
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:41,680
you can have it's complex it's

118
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:45,710
definitely a long-term issue that

119
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,669
appears in long term perspective as well

120
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:51,948
as its consequences and of course there

121
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:57,378
are economic interests that are strongly

122
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:59,689
affected usually by that then what is

123
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:05,180
the best solution on environmental

124
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:09,229
issues we may think of it we may think

125
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:14,899
we know it but first of all we have to

126
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:17,089
look for them how can we do it we need

127
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:23,389
some kind of approach at least in the

128
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:26,060
beginning we can try pologize them into

129
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,879
three approaches so as you can see it's

130
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,680
a formative approach so for example you

131
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,940
participate in a green party you get

132
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,159
elected to the Parliament it might be a

133
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:40,219
radical approach protests so you can

134
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,120
participate in Friday's or future or

135
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:51,040
extinction rebellion or it could be

136
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:51,040
creating parallel structures excuse me

137
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,019
sorry I won't

138
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:10,439
so reformative the reformative approach

139
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,889
it's something done on high manager

140
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:18,899
level usual in politics so regulation is

141
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:21,720
a typical instrument of such approach if

142
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:25,169
you regulate something you are actually

143
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:29,459
proposing and imposing some rules and

144
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:32,519
these rules are to be enforced by force

145
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:35,998
in case there are not someone is not

146
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:38,369
complying with them this is the

147
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,619
disadvantage of the reformative approach

148
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:44,600
because once you're forcing someone to

149
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:50,009
do something accept of let's say ethical

150
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:52,470
aspect also it's not so easy to find out

151
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:55,079
if it's effective or not so even if you

152
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,509
for example in your individual case find

153
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:59,399
out it doesn't work you still have to

154
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:01,829
comply with that otherwise you're under

155
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:06,480
the risk of penalty and your motivation

156
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:11,929
is not to get the penalty then the

157
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:16,079
quantifiable impact of such instruments

158
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:17,639
is not certain very often because we can

159
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,238
say all right there is some regulation

160
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:24,360
but how exactly this regulation effects

161
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:28,079
the result there will be many many

162
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:32,910
factors and to measure it it's not easy

163
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:38,189
it's actually pretty hard radical

164
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:41,339
approach can have very mass consequences

165
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:43,618
in especially liberal democracies as we

166
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,949
can see for example prac 7 district

167
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:49,709
recently declared the state of climate

168
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:52,589
emergency so I would say the Freddie's

169
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:55,169
for future have some impact on the other

170
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,970
hand what kind of impact isn't it just

171
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:59,279
the consequence of the pressure is it

172
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,650
the really based on some rational

173
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,260
decisions

174
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:08,140
in dictatorships there is another issue

175
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,810
because such a protest such radical

176
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,090
approach is usually not very effective

177
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:16,630
because you're being simply destroyed by

178
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:20,110
the power and of course there's a risk

179
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:23,890
of manipulation there is this kind of

180
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:27,190
risk everywhere but especially we have

181
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:31,180
mass protests it's quite easy to find

182
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,610
that way how to put some ideas into it

183
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,120
and get the masses manipulated because

184
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:41,700
there is some psychological aspect of

185
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:46,000
this approach what is parallel approach

186
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:48,610
is the same with any police the idea was

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,400
proposed by Russell Banda in his essay

188
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:56,950
called parallel police para Nepal is in

189
00:11:51,400 --> 00:12:00,370
check as he reacted on the state of

190
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,830
charter 77 which was a organization

191
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:07,540
fighting for human rights in 70s in

192
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:12,310
Czechoslovakia and the core of this idea

193
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:17,410
is you're not demanding solution which

194
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:19,810
is the approach of radical radicals

195
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,660
you're not forcing it which is the

196
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:25,589
reformative approach you simply create

197
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,689
it of course you're not creating the

198
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:31,720
solution the global one for everything

199
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,870
right now but you create it and you have

200
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:39,100
a chance to test it a chance to iterate

201
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:43,150
and to find out if this approach or if

202
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:46,800
this solution works in a smaller scale

203
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:49,329
and please keep it in mind because

204
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,750
makanda will be talking about the

205
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,760
scaling and iteration and so on as one

206
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:59,860
of the core principles of parallel

207
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,680
approach it's practical and independent

208
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,720
solution what does it mean independent

209
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:09,790
independent solution means independent

210
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:12,040
of power structures if you've already

211
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,589
attended across Congress you've probably

212
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:19,959
heard of ideas

213
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:21,699
like independence of state or ideas

214
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:27,248
about the state power and its

215
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:29,469
consequences but let's summarize it it's

216
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:33,610
not only about state it's about the

217
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:37,209
power structure so the examples I put on

218
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:40,059
the board is known only the state also

219
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:42,339
corporations so Facebook is definitely

220
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:44,649
power structure and it could be also the

221
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,959
community governed by some psychopath or

222
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:51,759
someone with big influence who is able

223
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:56,949
to impose the power instruments and to

224
00:13:51,759 --> 00:14:02,649
get his solution towards others actually

225
00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:05,649
because like based on his power what are

226
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:12,610
the advantages of parallel parallel

227
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:16,629
structures first of all maybe they're

228
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:19,000
they identify the real issues so for

229
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:21,670
example for us if we have a problem with

230
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,600
agriculture and the way how it's used

231
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:28,689
how its operated we can't change the

232
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,339
whole agriculture but we have to if you

233
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:35,559
want to do something we have to find a

234
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:39,730
way how to let's say change something so

235
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:42,009
if for example you don't know what is in

236
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,430
your food or your eating and you want to

237
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:47,290
get it more transparent then you could

238
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,750
find the way how to grow your food more

239
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,719
transparently so for example in

240
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,819
hydroponic system because you use a

241
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,970
water and you use some kind of

242
00:14:54,819 --> 00:15:00,219
fertilizer you will problem you know

243
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,170
what is inside or at least you have much

244
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,079
better chance than if you buy something

245
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,149
at the shop because the whole chain is

246
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:10,449
first of all in transparent and it's

247
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:15,809
also a very robust to get to know

248
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:19,059
exactly what is it voluntary approach as

249
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:22,059
its advantage from ethical point of view

250
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:24,309
as well as if you do something voluntary

251
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:26,170
you also can stop doing it

252
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:27,160
voluntary and change your mind change

253
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,829
your change

254
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,560
your activity and the mistakes are

255
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:36,099
cheaper because if you can change it

256
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:40,149
more flexibly then you probably not

257
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:42,850
waste so many sources so many resources

258
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:48,480
on your action if it's not effective and

259
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:51,550
if it's the dead end actually so

260
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,819
application and big problems as I

261
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,490
mentioned it will be it will be how will

262
00:15:54,819 --> 00:16:01,509
talk about it in bigger detail however

263
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:04,839
the idea is you start small and local

264
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:09,939
solution then if it works you can scale

265
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:12,730
up to bacon global solution also it

266
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:14,920
would like to start the parallel project

267
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,709
the difference between the common

268
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,949
startup and parallel startup let's say

269
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:25,029
or project is that you're working on

270
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:29,910
some common benefit so this is the idea

271
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:32,860
behind all together with the others and

272
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:37,540
last but not least it's parallel not

273
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:41,529
counter approach what does it mean it's

274
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:43,870
natural that if you bring some good

275
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:47,430
solution that works and you're able to

276
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:49,660
scale it it might probably affect

277
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,719
legislation for example or let's say

278
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,719
reformative approaches as well as the

279
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,490
radical approaches so this is also

280
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,420
something what what's not been done is

281
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:04,630
as I predicted as a humanization of

282
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:07,510
existing structures so it's not that you

283
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,220
are going to destroy the existing

284
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,890
structures or destroy the power

285
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,500
structures but because of you succeed

286
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:18,010
with your solution the existing

287
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,589
structures can get human eyes or can get

288
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,530
more effective and they adjust to the

289
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:29,158
better solution that's the also part of

290
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:31,840
the idea so thank you and now if you

291
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:35,039
don't think it's possible or you're

292
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,620
still asking how can someone think of

293
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,360
using a small solution and scale up to

294
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,020
big solution and change something from

295
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,659
scratch

296
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,650
I would like to give a word to me how I

297
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,000
was going to describe the principles and

298
00:17:46,650 --> 00:18:00,360
specific way how we were doing that

299
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:04,200
thank you clicker okay thank you much

300
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:07,178
thank you to everybody for coming

301
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,940
it's my pleasure to tell you our story

302
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:13,480
about parallel garden and to put some

303
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,220
context about the Redeem reading part of

304
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,510
the presentation about the theoretical

305
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:22,750
things and to try to tell you some

306
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:24,490
specific stories and how how we did it

307
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:28,330
that we still still continue in a

308
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,490
project how we built in parallel way

309
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:34,120
from scratch locally but with global

310
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:37,240
vision and ambition when I when I was

311
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,659
thinking to prepare this presentation I

312
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,570
came up with four principles what we are

313
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,780
doing and that we are trying to stay

314
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:49,750
with our project to be long-term and not

315
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:53,020
be hype just about the first interest of

316
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:55,450
people in in first three months in such

317
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:58,710
place like parallel parallel police

318
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:02,910
parallel police which is very common and

319
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:05,320
four specific principles the fusion is

320
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:08,830
parent police strategy loyal community

321
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,780
lean approach and honest open source and

322
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:14,050
I will tell you about the each of these

323
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,840
and try to connect it parent police

324
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,210
strategy parallel approach regime told

325
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,189
you a lot about the the parallel police

326
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,350
and the concept of what's love bandha so

327
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,710
I will try to be quite fast in this part

328
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:31,449
but I would definitely recommend you to

329
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:34,920
read the DSA it's a is just eight pages

330
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:37,600
and it's written by both love bandha

331
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:41,170
it's really important you know to read

332
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,510
it you know because it's then it makes

333
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:48,100
sense you know like what is really

334
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:50,650
matter to be parallel about our project

335
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,100
I would like to I would like to say that

336
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,540
we see parallel garden as application of

337
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,689
the power

338
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:00,750
principal in agriculture and we try and

339
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:05,850
we try to be inspiration to show that

340
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:08,430
you can approach with that you can that

341
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,709
you can use the parallel approach also

342
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,830
in other sectors you know such as

343
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:16,110
education music and journalism this

344
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,449
project would be something like parallel

345
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:23,159
school parallel sound or parallel

346
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:25,280
broadcasting we are very lucky that we

347
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,350
have this platform of parallel police

348
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,149
concept we have this building and we can

349
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:35,280
gather the community and to get to meet

350
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:38,070
very very interesting people from from

351
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,530
different fields you know and it's very

352
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:44,340
important and the second second

353
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:46,139
principle is lower community and our

354
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,620
story you know how we start to build a

355
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,720
community

356
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,860
it was our our main goal at the

357
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,150
beginning and we start we start to pro

358
00:20:52,860 --> 00:21:01,020
with production of and vero meetups

359
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:03,870
every two weeks we started last last

360
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:06,930
year and the goal was to gather

361
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:10,530
community together and speak with with

362
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:13,830
great professionals and meet people and

363
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:16,680
speak about the problem in enviro and so

364
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,810
on this is the picture after after our

365
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,740
fort and vero Meetup and you can see

366
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:26,250
that the Institute of krypton are he is

367
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,650
already quite full now we already

368
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:32,970
produce something like 15 and vero

369
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:35,190
meetups and and regularly we have like

370
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,080
60 people here you know so it's quite

371
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,080
quite big community and we are lucky

372
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,460
that the community is quite loyal to us

373
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:48,060
and we can speak with them you know and

374
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:51,930
get some new insights you know and from

375
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:54,120
from different fields building the

376
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,250
community you know like this is the

377
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,800
story you know like it's not just about

378
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,480
the producing and vero meetups you need

379
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,669
to get the keys to the cafe you know

380
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,210
because after the first two and vero

381
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:08,430
meetups the people who came here to do

382
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,870
parallel police

383
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:13,150
after the anvil meetup you know they

384
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,309
were set from from the the baristas in

385
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,930
cafe that oh come on you should not be

386
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,059
here it's already it's already closed

387
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,650
you know and then it's not possible to

388
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:22,809
gather community you know when you when

389
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:26,440
you don't have a space to meet with

390
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:28,270
people and communicate so we think with

391
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,190
with my colleagues you know and say you

392
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,139
know how to make the place you know

393
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,740
where you can stay with people and talk

394
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,300
with them and and have a lot of time to

395
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,610
speak with them and find some new

396
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,919
solutions you know so we we take the the

397
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,780
keys and stay with people very often

398
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,640
until until two o'clock in the morning

399
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,740
you know and and then you have speak

400
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,570
like for six hours or something like

401
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,870
that a lot of people from our

402
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:56,950
communities is here today so I'm very

403
00:22:52,870 --> 00:23:00,879
glad you know so this is the picture

404
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:04,210
it's something like 32 midnight you know

405
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,950
and very often we stayed until until

406
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,140
midnight or 12 o clock in the morning

407
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,360
and it was very important to our project

408
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,760
you know and where we are still still in

409
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,330
touch with our community and they helped

410
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,980
us a lot

411
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:18,070
you know also with we don't know how

412
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,350
with with funding you know and so on a

413
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:24,879
lot of things I will I was very

414
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:28,090
impressed you know how powerful is when

415
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,410
you are in regular touch with with the

416
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,449
people who are interested about your

417
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:35,020
about your topics so I really recommend

418
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:38,530
to try to do this and to be to be

419
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,990
authentic and open the third the third

420
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,730
principle is lean approach its

421
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,170
methodology I would definitely recommend

422
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,030
this book you know because it's

423
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,950
metallics and you should be quite

424
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,470
disciplined to follow the rules about

425
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:54,280
the metallics and not be very creative

426
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:56,920
which is very common running clean that

427
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:03,360
was our inspiration it's like something

428
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:07,330
like 200 pages and I would say two most

429
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,070
important things and I can see it very

430
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,639
common also here in peril and police

431
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:17,050
because it's it's linked with crypto

432
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:21,340
projects and startups and so on that you

433
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:23,260
should be very careful developed wisely

434
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,230
and with respect to all resources of

435
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,090
your project but it's not just about

436
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:32,200
money it's also about the people about

437
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:33,850
your time and sometimes people are too

438
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,340
fast but sometimes they are think

439
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:39,850
thinking too much you know so it's it's

440
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:44,230
some kind of yeah it's better to follow

441
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,939
the meta Dixon and but but the the more

442
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:50,740
important things I would say that it's

443
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:52,780
very often very actually accelerated you

444
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,080
know that people in startups try to be

445
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,090
very fast expand and scale you know

446
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,520
because it's hyped you know and you can

447
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:03,040
see it in a movies and so on but but you

448
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,950
should build you should build a stable

449
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,020
foundations of the project and we we

450
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:12,070
really spend a lot of time to speak

451
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:15,400
about about our steps and what to do and

452
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:17,649
not be so back you know and every second

453
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,250
week and in television or try to make a

454
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:22,990
PR interviews and so on and much focused

455
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,850
about the technology and try the first

456
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:30,190
steps you know what the technology and

457
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:32,649
technology will do and I can show you an

458
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,990
example in our project in parallel

459
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,940
garden it's like in iterations leading

460
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,950
to the first rooftop greenhouse in the

461
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,070
Czech Republic and Slovakia it was our

462
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:44,950
goal from the beginning we we wanted to

463
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:47,350
build the first rooftop greenhouse on

464
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,780
the top of parallel any polish because

465
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:52,780
this is this building is the the best

466
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,850
you know for such such a project I know

467
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:58,000
it already from the past you know from

468
00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:00,250
my second project the Kotel so this

469
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,850
community and people are great and you

470
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:07,030
can be very very open in your in your

471
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:10,600
visions so that was that was our goal

472
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:14,350
from the beginning but when you when you

473
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:17,500
think just to build that the rooftop the

474
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,449
the greenhouse rooftop you would start

475
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,030
just with money with funding you know

476
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,460
with we talks about money and and

477
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:27,879
venture capital but we did it different

478
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:33,150
way probably the the lean way this is

479
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,150
like one year ago and we just came to

480
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,910
one

481
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:39,040
say hackers place you know and three

482
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,950
people and spend something like 20 hours

483
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,680
to build the first hydroponics system is

484
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:48,250
still still there it's in Bitcoin cafe

485
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,590
you can we can go there you know after

486
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,530
after my talk and after after a coup and

487
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:56,199
we build this simple box you know it's

488
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,629
nothing nothing special you know it's

489
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,970
not no magic box or something like that

490
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,550
we just spend something like 20 hours

491
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,740
took together meet each other and speak

492
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:08,370
about our project this is the first

493
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:11,110
iteration worked well very well and

494
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:13,689
impressed the community in parallel in

495
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:17,740
Polish you know because we put something

496
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:20,730
like something like a new design piece

497
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:23,230
you know in Bitcoin coffee and it's our

498
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:27,190
romantics it's very strict about design

499
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:29,470
in in coffee so and like in whole

500
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,300
parallel police so a lot of people were

501
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,910
interested how we made it you know like

502
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:36,850
that our hydroponic system can can can

503
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:38,980
be in in Bitcoin coffee so we get some

504
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:43,300
some first interest and the first

505
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:45,280
hydroponic systems was without Internet

506
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,520
of Things device we didn't get any data

507
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:52,840
it was very simple you know with analog

508
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:55,000
at that time and only only thing with

509
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,669
which computer was was the web camera

510
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,490
which was taking you know one picture in

511
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:03,850
five minutes or something like that but

512
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:06,310
it made some interest and and we got in

513
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:09,010
cooperation with guys you know when you

514
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:12,730
can see already that the IOT of the IOT

515
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:15,790
device internet of things and after 1 1

516
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,820
months or two months of the project we

517
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:21,879
could get we could get data from from

518
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,879
hydroponic system so we decide to build

519
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:28,030
8 of these smaller boxes to to be able

520
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,800
to iterate in in the technology what we

521
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:35,139
need to our our goal to - our rooftop

522
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,129
green green house which is the IOT in

523
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:41,500
automatization and LED lights so we made

524
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:44,140
eight of these and already it was

525
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,180
crowdfunded from our closest friends you

526
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,550
know and supporters from around police

527
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:54,760
so we were able to get

528
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:56,169
funding funding yeah and this is this is

529
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,390
the other iteration it's already

530
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:00,100
vertical hydroponic system and we

531
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,530
install it not in parallel in Polish but

532
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,230
in Bistro very near from here in lata

533
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:08,860
which is very it's one of the most

534
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:12,310
hipsters buy place and we throw a at

535
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,350
Lata so it get even more interest but

536
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,720
this vertical system is it's already

537
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,969
scalable you know so you can use some

538
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,680
some kind of some kind of this

539
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,650
technology or vertical hydroponic

540
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:28,210
already in a rooftop greenhouse you know

541
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:30,790
so we are already on our way and this

542
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,920
vertical hydroponics we already solved

543
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:35,290
with whit profit you know so it's

544
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:38,980
already already profitable project like

545
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:41,740
not very important profit but but we are

546
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,170
able to build it and put it into the

547
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,810
rooftop greenhouse and this is the

548
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:49,480
vision and the last thing is honest open

549
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:52,030
source I would just want to say that

550
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,630
that we open all of our know-how on

551
00:29:52,030 --> 00:30:00,430
github you can build your own hydroponic

552
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:02,800
systems you can also buy or write to to

553
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,160
our friends to get the hardware and and

554
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,780
download of the software or firmware

555
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,630
written for for our projects you can

556
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,220
download it and build it but for a lot

557
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,650
of people in our community

558
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,990
github a lot of people never heard about

559
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,580
the github you know so you can you

560
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,370
should be more careful how will you

561
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:24,189
communicate with the people so we we

562
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:27,429
connected communication on github

563
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:31,330
Facebook YouTube sometimes on Instagram

564
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:33,550
and we we are doing every every second

565
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,389
week a YouTube streaming about the new

566
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:39,970
iterations in in our project and so this

567
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:43,660
is the the regular contact with with our

568
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:46,450
supporters and we are on our way how to

569
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:49,690
build the rooftop greenhouse and maybe

570
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:52,750
in in next and next occurs occurs

571
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:55,560
Congress we will be able to guide you

572
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:59,800
there and show you our new technology

573
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,550
yeah this is our friend you know from

574
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,159
from the community and

575
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:07,610
yeah so this is this is our challenge

576
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:12,950
you can try our our open source

577
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:16,280
technology and I would like to to ask

578
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:18,830
you to build one of first hydroponics on

579
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:24,320
your own and share your experience with

580
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:26,449
us and now I will give I will give give

581
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,220
the space for for a coop and he will he

582
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,190
will tell you more and give you some

583
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:41,210
visual excursion about our projects

584
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:44,200
thank you good evening thank you

585
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:47,240
I will speak mostly to the technological

586
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,340
aspects of the project so this is the

587
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,240
first hydroponic box we built in the

588
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:55,070
Bitcoin coffee now how it works

589
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,260
basically the box serves as the

590
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,950
reservoir for the water with the

591
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,680
nutritions

592
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:03,080
there is a pump and the pump is pumping

593
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,420
the solution to the irrigation system

594
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,870
and through these through these tubes

595
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:12,500
and needles the plants are watered by

596
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:14,689
the drip irrigation then the excess

597
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:18,170
water gets collected back in the box

598
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:20,420
again and circulates inside so we know

599
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:23,840
exactly what is inside the system what

600
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:28,190
is the income for the plant to grow we

601
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:33,110
are saving water about about 97 percent

602
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:35,750
of water consumption in in comparison to

603
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:39,740
the to the growing in the soil is saved

604
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:43,150
and basically we can grow anywhere we

605
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:47,780
want independently on the soil under

606
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:49,730
let's say on the soil ownership and also

607
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,700
independent independently on the

608
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:56,540
distribution chains because we can grow

609
00:32:52,700 --> 00:33:00,220
anywhere so so that's one of the best

610
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:03,440
advantages of the hydroponic systems

611
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:05,390
this is the first device we applied to

612
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,179
the to the

613
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:12,110
a hydroponic system in the Bitcoin kofi

614
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:14,960
this one this IOT device serves just for

615
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,419
the data monitoring it doesn't control

616
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,370
anything but we are already collecting

617
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:24,470
data about temperature light intensity

618
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:28,370
or moisture of the substrate the second

619
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:31,400
one is this experimental box as you as

620
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:35,949
you can as you will see we have one of

621
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:39,710
them installed in the in the lava Becca

622
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:41,480
and you will see that it already looks a

623
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,760
bit different because we made some

624
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,429
adjustments on it we had issues with the

625
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,299
lies that they were well well not strong

626
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:54,020
enough so we did some changes but what's

627
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:56,660
the biggest achievement is that now the

628
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,820
system is monitored by the device but

629
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:03,080
also controlled the device is

630
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:05,659
controlling the pump and also the light

631
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,679
not only in the regime on and off but

632
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:12,080
also it can control exactly the power of

633
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:17,389
the lights the electricity consumption

634
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:20,090
and so on this is the soil sensor this

635
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:24,109
is the webcam for the for the picture

636
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:27,919
collection collecting and this this is

637
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:31,460
this is the latest design this vertical

638
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:35,569
one this one is a little bit different

639
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:38,149
because the plant is growing in the in

640
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:40,460
the basket in the channel with the

641
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:42,830
stable water level and the substrate

642
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,850
sucks the water up and the roots are

643
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:48,889
rooting in the water there is only a

644
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:52,100
small rock oval cube or it could be some

645
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:55,879
paper pot or a chief a pot and and the

646
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:58,279
plant gets and everything that needs

647
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:01,420
from the water solution as you can see

648
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,580
the water is running through the pipe

649
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:08,750
under the system there is the reservoir

650
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:14,240
pumps the water up and it goes back so

651
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:16,070
it's again very simple and this is yeah

652
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,709
this is the idea something where we

653
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:21,400
would like to get

654
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:23,859
the automated greenhouse or whatever but

655
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,170
yeah we are working a lot on the

656
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:28,538
automation not that much in the way to

657
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:32,829
save the manpower but to control the

658
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:34,990
resources as wisely as possible for

659
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:38,859
example we are now ready to start

660
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:40,839
programming that the device will measure

661
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:43,359
the light income from the outside and

662
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:46,420
will control in real time the output of

663
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,609
the lights so we will we will we will

664
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:53,140
work precisely with the energy

665
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:57,150
consumption and and so on so that's the

666
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:59,558
way of automation we are trying to bring

667
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:02,079
if you are interested in the

668
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:03,549
technologies we are mostly communicating

669
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,380
with the public through the Facebook

670
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:07,930
where you can also find the link to the

671
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:10,630
github and these because it's just

672
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:12,190
difficult to bring the people from let's

673
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,869
say my profession or different

674
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:16,749
professions to the github they don't

675
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:20,619
know this platform so that's our main

676
00:36:16,749 --> 00:36:23,140
communication channel about the IOT

677
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:25,390
device well in our way it's a small

678
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,848
computer or series of computers that

679
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:30,879
communicate outside or between

680
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:33,700
themselves through the internet they

681
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,220
serve to measure the data store the data

682
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,970
and control the key elements in real

683
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:42,430
time we are so far measuring light

684
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:45,368
intensity substrate moisture and

685
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:48,578
temperature now we are controlling the

686
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:52,599
light and irrigation system by operating

687
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:54,099
the pump or solenoid valve and later we

688
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:55,589
will probably also take a look at the

689
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:59,160
heat

690
00:36:55,589 --> 00:37:03,519
why because how we would like to develop

691
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:06,399
cost wisely accessible automation

692
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:11,258
technologies that are effectively

693
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:13,390
working with the resources this is our

694
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:16,180
last installation of the IOT device

695
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:18,098
where one of our friends was building

696
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:21,819
this irrigation system on his field and

697
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:24,910
we managed to connect the IOT device to

698
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:26,019
the system so the system is

699
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,269
series-production

700
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:30,790
nothing special we just add added one

701
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:34,569
cable there to be able to

702
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:38,529
connect the device and here there is the

703
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:45,760
soil sensor then it sends data to the to

704
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:49,120
the to the ESP and then it controls the

705
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,450
valve this is how the data we are

706
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:55,299
collecting look like from the soil and

707
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:57,339
we have a series of water meters to be

708
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,890
able to calculate if we are saving the

709
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:03,480
water basically our idea is to operate

710
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:06,100
the drip irrigation precisely on

711
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:11,200
depending on the soil moisture in real

712
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:13,360
time again and the farm boat is American

713
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,359
open-source project we decided to build

714
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:19,240
it well for a few reasons first there

715
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:22,780
was a there was a supporter who we met

716
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:25,060
on our environment ups and he offered us

717
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:28,450
to bring this thing because he bought it

718
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:30,880
and you know he felt like it will be out

719
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:33,839
of his capacity to build it and somehow

720
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,730
make it work so we took it over

721
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:39,910
we started programming it it's also open

722
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:42,190
source so it gives us a lot of gives us

723
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:45,790
a lot of feedback about how open source

724
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,570
project might look like and how to work

725
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,240
with it

726
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:52,540
this farm bot is basically something

727
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:56,560
like 3d printer CNC machine that

728
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:59,259
operates on the flower bed it has tools

729
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:03,009
that it can exchange and do some

730
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:05,560
operations like irrigation weeding it

731
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:08,110
can measure the soil moisture and it

732
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:12,009
moves and and does this important work

733
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:15,850
for instead of people so for us it's

734
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:17,950
mostly about the research and this is

735
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:20,980
the calibration of weeds there is a

736
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:23,410
camera installed inside each plant we

737
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:26,310
want to grow has its coordinate and the

738
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:30,430
camera learns to recognize green and

739
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:33,070
once it sees anything green away from

740
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:36,220
the coordinates of the culture plant it

741
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:41,910
it destroys it because it evaluates it

742
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:44,410
as a weed and this is how the farming

743
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:48,629
software looks like that

744
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:51,549
it's quite interesting that even you

745
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:54,609
basically anyone can basically anyone

746
00:39:51,549 --> 00:39:57,489
can can do it it's like special

747
00:39:54,609 --> 00:40:02,229
programming language which is also open

748
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:05,880
sourced so so so it's possible to learn

749
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:11,618
how to do it this is how the wheat

750
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:15,130
recognization looks like this is the

751
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:18,369
farmer watering and this is the this is

752
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:23,259
the tools we are it's using there is the

753
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:29,140
moisture meter seeding needle irrigation

754
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:32,470
head and so on so that's it from from my

755
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:34,598
side we would like to continue with the

756
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,700
short toured through our installations

757
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:41,349
because they're basically all nearby

758
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:43,960
around its within the the area and also

759
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:46,359
we have we have few samples of the

760
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:50,920
lattice we've grown in the hydroponic

761
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:51,308
system so feel free to taste and eat it

762
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:59,339
all

763
00:40:51,309 --> 00:41:03,729
thank you but thank you but before

764
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:07,089
before you go take the tool and taste

765
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:10,089
how the community life of Enver meetups

766
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:12,578
look like we like to pass your word and

767
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:15,549
if you have any questions please write

768
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:19,029
them we have like 5 minutes or maybe 2-3

769
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:21,579
questions depending how brief you are so

770
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:25,229
is there are some questions would anyone

771
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:25,229
like to ask

772
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,000
do you have plans to weaponize the farm

773
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:37,710
boat with the laser for the reading part

774
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,010
and if so what would be the power guys

775
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:43,410
did you get the question please repeat

776
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:45,690
do you plan to develop a new module for

777
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:49,819
the farm boat for the reading like

778
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,820
equipped with the laser head and like

779
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:58,590
maybe laser but I guess we don't really

780
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:01,620
know how how powerful it should be and

781
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:06,870
so far we don't know how to implement it

782
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:15,600
to the system someone wants to answer it

783
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:17,940
well okay so another question first I

784
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:21,060
want to congratulate you for the project

785
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:25,470
I think it's amazing I would like to ask

786
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:27,810
you if you consider aquaponic ax which

787
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:31,770
is basically creating a closed ecosystem

788
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:33,830
where the fishes feeds from the plants

789
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:38,670
that you have and then you can have both

790
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:42,210
kind of food yeah actually we actually

791
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:45,830
we we have some we know about some other

792
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:48,090
projects which are focused on aquaponics

793
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:51,330
so far we are not working with

794
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:54,450
aquaponics for a few reasons one is that

795
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:58,710
it demands like another extra know-how

796
00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:02,220
quite a lot of energy to spend on it the

797
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:04,530
second is the so far we have not seen

798
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,779
any project that would not have like

799
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:09,390
problems with the fish sometimes they

800
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:12,540
die sometimes they get disease it must

801
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,920
get solved somehow and it can also

802
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:20,180
affect the production also also the

803
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:24,840
nutrition water from the fish needs

804
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:27,720
additives again to grow the plants so so

805
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:32,370
far we are working with the system that

806
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:37,310
we can understand more easily and faster

807
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:40,430
we are focused on using like biological

808
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:42,009
fertilizers and so on and

809
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,049
like maybe the next step will be

810
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:47,470
aquaponics but also if you're running

811
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:52,190
aquaponics system you also need to find

812
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:54,980
basically the economic sustainable model

813
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:58,390
with the fish not only with the lattice

814
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:02,480
or the vegetable it's another whole

815
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:05,180
process to establish so hopefully yes

816
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:11,990
hopefully we will get there but so far

817
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:13,640
so far we're not there yet but regards

818
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:17,390
fishes we are definitely interested

819
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:23,150
about using heat from from mining or

820
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:26,569
even from from some kind of power plants

821
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:30,560
you know to use it to for us some kind

822
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:33,050
of fishes you know we can work together

823
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:38,720
and so we are definitely interested

824
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:44,330
about this combination is there any

825
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:46,100
other urgent question if not those who

826
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,290
are interested you can join guys

827
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,089
