00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,409
[Music]

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,149
[Music]

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,420
[Applause]

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,890
so first of all thank you everyone

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,180
obviously for organizing this and also

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,900
inviting me here a brief note on the

7
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,700
timetable

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,800
it says I'm presenting with a colleague

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,150
of mine Paul Zeidler unfortunately he's

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,809
sick should I move this away from my

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:46,400
mouth about oh good yeah okay yeah

12
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:49,390
unfortunately my colleague Paul is sick

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,370
so I'm gonna be doing this solo for now

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,410
so yep basically what I'm gonna be doing

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,900
in this talk as was previously

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,900
previously kind of introduced Terra zero

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,210
was very much kind of something that

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,730
occurred a lot of the time within the

19
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,610
art space and very much kind of we were

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,409
trying to use as a bit of a kind of like

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,330
a series of experimental projects and

22
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,909
what I want to do given the context of

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,550
the festival and opting out is I want to

24
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:18,979
try and contextualize that within a kind

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,509
of Nilla jism which is on on the on the

26
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:23,750
screen up there which is cancer

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,540
ecologies so the structure of this talk

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,969
is kind of gonna go as follows I'm gonna

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,979
kind of go through a brief discussion of

30
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:33,530
cancer economics which I'm sure a lot of

31
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:34,850
you are aware of but maybe just so

32
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,100
everyone's like on the same page and

33
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,140
then talk about okay what what is this

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:43,788
term contra colleges that were kind of

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,409
playfully trying to define here and then

36
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:47,810
hopefully I'm going to kind of

37
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,280
contextualize a lot of the work that we

38
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,259
did with Terra zero or try and

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,640
contextualize counter ecologies as kind

40
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:56,030
of springing out of this and becoming

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,340
maybe or more politically or kind of

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,020
like action informed way of engaging

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,180
with some of the topics that we've been

44
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,399
playing with for a couple of years so

45
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,950
the main questions of the talk really

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,110
are what are counts for economic

47
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,050
ecological actions so what is counter

48
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,150
ecology in a very broad sense and then

49
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:19,520
also we're just kind of crypto fit into

50
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:21,860
all of this and so there we go so cancer

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,990
economics generally is also known as

52
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,110
counter establishment economics and it

53
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,480
was defined by Samuel Koch in in 1974

54
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,849
basically just as a tactic to kind of

55
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,238
enable the creation of a voluntary or an

56
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:37,519
Agora society and this was kind of best

57
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,830
expanded upon in his 1980s public

58
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,620
in 1980 publication the new libertarian

59
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:47,660
manifesto and very simply poor algorism

60
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,430
kind of dictates or is based on the

61
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,490
premise that all forms of association

62
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,830
between people should be voluntary and

63
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:57,560
so it kind of split from at the time the

64
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,210
US libertarian movement in that it

65
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,750
followed from its idea of self-ownership

66
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:04,280
but it kind of really also held the

67
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,400
principle of non-aggression is a kind of

68
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,690
an integral or like a key tenant to it

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,540
and it was basically defined as the

70
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,160
study or practice of all peaceful human

71
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,070
action that was forbidden by the state

72
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,960
and the kind of things that fall into

73
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,450
this category are obviously like

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,440
alternative currencies which a lot of

75
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,820
the people today are going to be talking

76
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,690
about in a new form but they have

77
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:32,150
existed for well centuries illegal

78
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,570
migration smuggling mutual credit and

79
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:39,010
mutual aid groups substance farming and

80
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:41,000
off-grid energy generation and this

81
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,660
graph this on the board is actually

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,730
although credited to Derek bronze from

83
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,799
from his article vertical and horizontal

84
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,390
algorism

85
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,670
actually came from a Swedish academic

86
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,339
Hope Boylan's analysis of cancer

87
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,679
economics where he defined possible

88
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,330
actions that you can undertake via

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,820
either their being vertical or

90
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,400
horizontal in their strategies and so a

91
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,620
vertol vertical strategy would be just

92
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,600
building local or neighborhood networks

93
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,880
of infrastructure so we have this idea

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,019
of Community Technology obviously

95
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,490
something that the parallel Polar's crew

96
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,110
are really doing with their approach to

97
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:17,600
kind of introducing new comers to crypto

98
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,660
via having a node set up here doing a

99
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,070
coffee kind of doing this very locally

100
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,570
based introductory talks that are kind

101
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,640
of bringing people into the fold of

102
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,760
using something like an alternative

103
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,830
currency and then also represented on

104
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,349
the board we have horizontal which are

105
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:36,080
kind of the more traditional black

106
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:38,600
market approaches to kind of evading or

107
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,840
existing outside of the state so non

108
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,310
state sanctioned trade of any kinds

109
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,900
which aren't necessarily look how old

110
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,490
based in the same way the vertical

111
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:52,349
approaches are

112
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:54,030
and this problem of location in terms of

113
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,560
how we can interact with our environment

114
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,340
or how we can do something new is maybe

115
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,800
a good segue into starting to try and

116
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,119
define counter ecologies this this term

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,810
that I threw in at the beginning that I

118
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,580
haven't actually explained yet and I

119
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,590
suppose it's based on the idea that

120
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,449
whilst it might be viable to actually

121
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,000
build counter economies in the

122
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,860
traditional sense especially as with the

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,539
case with crypto kind of like when they

124
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,199
have a purely digital infrastructure

125
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:26,940
that on either local based or can very

126
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:29,009
easily across whatever state lines so

127
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,289
cryptocurrencies marketplaces like Silk

128
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:34,110
Road obviously being perfect examples of

129
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,759
this the problem with councilor

130
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,330
economies or like counter economic

131
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,789
tactics that surround Ecology's is the

132
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,080
localization is obviously a massively

133
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:44,909
important factor of it because they are

134
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,508
usually based around a specific area and

135
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:50,250
with the case of a specific ecology

136
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:52,020
either this can't move or it's kind of

137
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,729
state and the problems associated with

138
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:59,039
it are determined by its locale so the

139
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:01,979
broad kind of initial definition we're

140
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,599
playing with and feedback on this during

141
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,039
the Q&A or afterwards is massively

142
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,979
appreciated because this is the first

143
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,090
time we're kind of presenting this it's

144
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,000
basically seeing what kind of

145
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,659
organizational models or what structures

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,550
we can try and create to like bolster

147
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:19,259
the sort of aims that we were working

148
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,090
with or experimenting with in terror

149
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,979
zero that I'll talk about kind of after

150
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:27,570
this and so really we can just

151
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:29,039
understand it in spatial terms in its

152
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,169
relationship to kind of existing

153
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,320
ecosystems so because there aren't

154
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:37,560
really any new frontiers to kind of

155
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,690
populate as the cyberpunk movement was

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,699
kind of populating the digital and kind

157
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,169
of like taking it taking the ground for

158
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,580
itself or creating new ground obviously

159
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,919
in the physical world is incredibly

160
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,780
difficult to do that outside of maybe

161
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,909
doing something like seasteading which

162
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,340
either requires loads of money or just

163
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:56,310
hasn't wax as of yet

164
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,940
the governance of kind of physical

165
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,410
spaces is already mostly mediated either

166
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,780
by the state

167
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,980
or by private ownership or by royal

168
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,780
ownership but all of these things really

169
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:10,770
are kind of already bound within legal

170
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,659
frameworks and so the starting point for

171
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,150
this idea of counter ecology was

172
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,390
basically the creation of tactical

173
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,890
spheres of influence on the eco sphere

174
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,330
which don't rely on the means of

175
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,419
optimizing the production of goods or

176
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:27,270
services or and all kind of integrating

177
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:30,330
this into existing economic or state

178
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,070
programs and very very simple examples

179
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,900
of this would just be kind of the

180
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,409
production of non registered and non tax

181
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,120
food or the illegal planting of trees to

182
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,300
kind of optimize the health of a local

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,420
bio top and so you can kind of

184
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,130
conceptualize it as as a supply layer or

185
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,590
maybe underneath black markets so

186
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:54,180
underneath these kind of like horizontal

187
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:55,469
tactics yep still on the board and so

188
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,900
it's kind of environmental action

189
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,430
towards ecosystems which supplies us

190
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,320
with material abundance in like a very

191
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:06,140
broad sense outside of this market logic

192
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:08,310
so for instance kind of co2 capture and

193
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,950
really we're trying to reconcile eyes

194
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,810
the place of material production outside

195
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,000
of state apparatus and outside of

196
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,930
existing kind of hierarchical corporate

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,520
structures and perfect examples of the

198
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,440
sort of actions that already exists

199
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,890
within these lines and definitely also

200
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,870
fall under kind of definitely also fall

201
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:30,120
under kind of vertical counter economics

202
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,860
tactics the first of which and maybe the

203
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,979
most immediately approachable would be

204
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,110
something like guerilla gardening so

205
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,090
guerrilla gardening is just gardening

206
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,289
growing plants often kind of vegetables

207
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:44,130
or fruit or herbs that are otherwise

208
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:46,110
useful in spaces regardless of who owns

209
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,030
them if anyone owns them but quite often

210
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,890
it's also done on private land or land

211
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,600
that's owned by the state so they're

212
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,800
quite often moved along or there's a lot

213
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
of tension between the people who are

214
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,000
actually engaging with it and the owners

215
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,500
of the land and maybe a kind of larger

216
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,750
expansion upon this which is something

217
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,810
that nicely segues into some of the

218
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:10,680
projects we've been doing is the work

219
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:14,010
that Carl Hess was involved in a couple

220
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,290
of decades ago so Carl has is maybe most

221
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:20,850
famously known for

222
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:22,650
political writings and his activism more

223
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,150
guerilla gardening particularly hardcore

224
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:27,300
guerrilla gardening at the top of trees

225
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,590
I am so Colchis

226
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,079
worked with the appropriate technology

227
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:35,490
movement and was involved with kind of

228
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:39,000
creating self kind of like DIY and self

229
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:41,760
managing technology in a neighborhood in

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,860
Washington DC called Adams Morgan where

231
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,380
they basically were engaging in how you

232
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:50,550
can create very easily manageable easily

233
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,930
up kept rooftop farming solar grids fish

234
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,189
farming in basements this kind of thing

235
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:59,430
and it was very successful at the time

236
00:09:53,190 --> 00:10:00,660
on this really local level and so to

237
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,099
kind of go into the next section of my

238
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:07,410
talk what do Paula Nile or do I know cuz

239
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,880
I'm heroin think that we can kind of

240
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,339
bring from our previous experience in

241
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,160
the crypto space obviously in the art

242
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,690
space as well and how can we maybe start

243
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,300
bringing these things together and like

244
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:22,050
creating new ways of doing stuff like

245
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:25,349
what Hess was doing and to kind of

246
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:29,819
contextualized Tara zero this started in

247
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:32,520
2016 as a project which we were kind of

248
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,280
very interested in this history of kind

249
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,990
of autonomy in the blockchain space

250
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,230
which was obviously coming out of very

251
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:43,440
cyberpunk notions of autonomy and

252
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:45,990
science fiction as well and we found a

253
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,620
lot of ideas that people had for these

254
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,660
kind of autonomous entities existing

255
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,210
using crypto in a very very basic way in

256
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,709
like a very mechanical sense and this

257
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,410
was essentially the one of the earliest

258
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:01,320
examples that we found which was just

259
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,680
from a thread on Bitcoin talk where a

260
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,450
user called Jules basically posited the

261
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,359
idea that a software agent could exist

262
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,500
on its own for the first time because it

263
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,020
would be able to pay for stuff like

264
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,610
hosting CPU and memory using Bitcoin and

265
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,710
because these agents can now own their

266
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:20,490
own wallets this was seen as a certain

267
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,960
mechanical autonomous entity and this

268
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,820
was very quickly expanded upon

269
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,310
especially once the etherium kind of got

270
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,350
going so this is a quote from one of

271
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,729
vitalik veterans kind of like relatively

272
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,990
early

273
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,820
larger posts which actually led to the

274
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,100
creation of what we now call his dolls

275
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,080
where he was kind of questioning whether

276
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,850
this human middleman was really

277
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,630
necessary for the form of mediation that

278
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:48,450
corporations currently have and one

279
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,490
thing we actually found afterwards was a

280
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,820
threat by an author called car loader

281
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,580
who actually posited something called a

282
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,210
diode and which was a DAC for a natural

283
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:03,480
system which actually was had a lot of

284
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:05,460
synergy between well there was a lot of

285
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,390
synergy between essentially what he was

286
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,350
positing here so kind of using these

287
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,000
block chain based organizational

288
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,240
structures that had some element of

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,290
autonomy which is the debate like there

290
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,850
is a lot debate in terms of what

291
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,500
autonomy is actually there but let's for

292
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,050
the moment kind of gloss over that I'll

293
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,430
come back to that later but there was a

294
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,870
lot of synergy essentially between this

295
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,870
thread and the original Terra zero

296
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,370
concept but we found afterwards but we

297
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,200
have actually since spoken to Karl and

298
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,420
he was just super happy other people

299
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,770
were playing kind of in the same

300
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:39,839
ballpark as him so that was pretty nice

301
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:43,380
but yeah from all of this we came up or

302
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,370
we kind of presented the original

303
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,620
concept piece for Terra zero and this

304
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:52,470
came from thinking okay what if we

305
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,390
actually expanded this idea that you

306
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,970
know the very simple mechanical agents

307
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,020
that kind of jewels presented and you

308
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,570
know taking some of the kind of

309
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,189
organizational mediation or the lack of

310
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,440
organizational mediation and they're

311
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:07,350
replacing it with contractual mediation

312
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,240
the butterman was talking about and we

313
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,350
took this a bit further so we actually

314
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,090
set up a situation where a plot of land

315
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,880
was able to be interacted with an owned

316
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,580
via a dhow so the DAO acted as the

317
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:25,170
mediating and interface between this is

318
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,850
eco system and everyone else so it's

319
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,660
basically an artwork and a prototype for

320
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,850
a self-owned

321
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:35,010
kind of technologically augmented forest

322
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:36,210
in 2016 and it basically just conceived

323
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,520
of a framework or we laid out a

324
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,350
framework in our concept paper where bio

325
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,120
forest was able to just very simply sell

326
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,190
licenses to log its own trees while

327
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,190
automated processes though a mediated by

328
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,080
smart contracts which now is very simple

329
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,540
at the time we had to explain what's

330
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,690
more contracts worth a lot more

331
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,160
and so we which would be pulls idler who

332
00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:00,000
should be here and the other co-founder

333
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,620
Paul calling envisaged ourselves buying

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,170
a plot of land and then signing this

335
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:08,850
over to a Dow and over time the logging

336
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,620
licenses and the funds that the Dow

337
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,330
would bring in by kind of selectively

338
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,400
selling its own trees so essentially

339
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:18,029
kind of like pruning itself to maintain

340
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,400
the healthier state that was possible it

341
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:22,140
would be able to buy back the land from

342
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,589
us so it was a we kind of almost giving

343
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,540
the Dowell mortgage initially and this

344
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,000
was kind of a conceptual exploration of

345
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,439
how inflexible smart contracts were and

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,560
how you could kind of tactically use

347
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,600
this so very simply if you made no

348
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,430
technical interface by which the

349
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,950
contract could actually sell the

350
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,290
ownership rights to its land to another

351
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,450
party and the land was legally signed to

352
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,219
the Dow which is another big F that I'm

353
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,830
going to come back to once I've kind of

354
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,900
gone through this explanation then there

355
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,730
wasn't actually any way in a technical

356
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,250
or legal sense that the forest could be

357
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,200
sold and brought back into the cycle of

358
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,750
land being bought and sold and then

359
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,589
stripped of his natural resources so is

360
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,910
this kind of very basic attempt or like

361
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:08,339
very conceptual like high level

362
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,800
conceptual attempts of appropriating

363
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:14,550
kind of capital at capitalist mechanisms

364
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,170
of resource exploitation and actually

365
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,719
laying out how a piece of ground could

366
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,599
start playing an active role in economic

367
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,060
flows whilst actually also directing

368
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,250
avoiding direct influence over itself so

369
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,859
this very very rough approximation of

370
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,730
what a self sovereign ecological entity

371
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,709
could actually be and what did we learn

372
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,630
oh sorry I completely missed this as

373
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:38,640
well this is just a fantastic cartoon

374
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,220
with regards to the difference between

375
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,569
legal rights and this kind of legal

376
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,580
rights of a corporation which we were

377
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,589
kind of playing with and trying to

378
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,300
appropriate obviously usually people

379
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:50,430
think of legal rights of a corporation

380
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,560
because it is usually this kind of

381
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,199
faceless grotesque thing that makes

382
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,489
corporations incredibly difficult to

383
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,750
kind of like legally interface with or

384
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,020
hold accountable and we kind of wanted

385
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:06,450
to appropriate that and give it to a

386
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:08,310
forest for better or worse and we were

387
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,140
we had a very we had a test site just

388
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,489
south of Berlin which this is just kind

389
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,319
of a stripped-down satellite image of

390
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,930
that we were kind of just using as a

391
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,370
technical playground as well and is

392
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:22,859
still going on as the technical

393
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:24,120
playground okay so what we learned from

394
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,500
this or what we learned from this

395
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,150
original concept piece that we've been

396
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,970
kind of mulling over for a while that

397
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,620
obviously there's been a lot of

398
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:35,190
development in the clip so in the

399
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:38,400
blockchain space especially with regards

400
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:42,020
to legal interfacing and what dowse can

401
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,020
and can't do particularly effectively

402
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:51,420
and the first of these which has kind of

403
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,760
become very evident in the past two

404
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,979
years you know everyone 2018 was the

405
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,430
year of the doubt and now 2019 is

406
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:03,270
apparently the year of the dowel again

407
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:05,550
is that dowels as organizational models

408
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,240
or like testers for new organizational

409
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:11,159
models are fits it like they're very

410
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,620
very interesting but the way that they

411
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,970
were initially conceived of and spoken

412
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:19,290
of so kind of like harkening back to

413
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,429
this quote of italics this is an

414
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:26,010
incredibly kind of mechanistic

415
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:27,240
repositioning of what mediation is it's

416
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,379
kind of just stripping everything down

417
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,040
and just hang ok cool you can

418
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,210
immediately and implicitly replace what

419
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,178
are actually very complex social

420
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:40,470
relations with quite simple mechanical

421
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,850
procedures and what we've kind of seen

422
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,280
in the last couple of years has been

423
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,510
this you know more and more projects

424
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,149
kind of engaging with thousand like

425
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,610
building dowels is that you have the

426
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,140
difference in the structural makeup

427
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:56,610
between the kind of main dowel models

428
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:58,050
and the first of these well the fact

429
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,649
that this structural engagement actually

430
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:05,100
exists really seems to suggest that

431
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:08,460
actually dowels are just kind of social

432
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,769
solutions novel social social solutions

433
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,179
to organizational problems that come

434
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:15,539
about because they're kind of bolstered

435
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:17,879
by this these certain forms of

436
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:21,059
autonomous mediation but they are still

437
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:22,830
inherently social forms the social is

438
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,908
not being replaced by this kind of

439
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:29,158
completely automated structure and so

440
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:31,249
Moloch Dowell on the one side of this

441
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,840
for those that don't know is a

442
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:37,379
essentially a reformatting of the kind

443
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,610
of guild model which is it's focused

444
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:40,889
around a very specific issue

445
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,779
so the initial Moloch Dao was built

446
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:46,949
around funding East 2.0 development and

447
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:49,499
there's very very little interaction

448
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,929
chain as the kind of nick szabo quote

449
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:56,070
above me suggests what it basically is

450
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:59,549
is a guild bank that that you can either

451
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,168
add new members to the dao and that's

452
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:02,999
voted upon by all the existing members

453
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:05,820
and they have shares that are delegated

454
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:08,460
to them and then they can then use those

455
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,220
shares to vote on other proposals be

456
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,929
those proposals i as an existing member

457
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,480
would like to extract x-- amounts of

458
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:16,889
money from the dao for this project or

459
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,320
is an existing member of the DAR would

460
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:21,799
like to add this other member to the dam

461
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,119
and that's it so it's incredibly simple

462
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,249
there's very little interaction on chain

463
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,199
and its really really reliant upon the

464
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:30,690
forms of social coordination and also

465
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,249
socially based reputation that are

466
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,590
actually far more akin to kind of

467
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:36,480
previously existing coop models so

468
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,970
really Moloch Dao is just kind of

469
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,299
leveraging the security and the minimal

470
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:45,149
but very secure coordination aspects of

471
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:47,730
something like the etherium Network to

472
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:51,689
kind of achieve an augment this

473
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:55,830
cooperative structure and this exists in

474
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:59,490
contrast to excuse me larger scale

475
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,230
organizations or Dao kind of models like

476
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,169
that are coming out of kind of Dao stack

477
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:06,749
development in Aragon who are working on

478
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:09,059
very very complex systems of having

479
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:10,409
obviously voting on chain but then also

480
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,690
you know kind of having tokens

481
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:15,659
representing refutation and the

482
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,039
different levels of how much reputation

483
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:18,509
you have and how much financial stake

484
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,639
you have actually kind of affecting then

485
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,620
the weighting of votes and all of this

486
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:24,229
so

487
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,779
the fact that there's this kind of like

488
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:30,080
quite hectic milieu of experimentation

489
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:32,120
with the house and down structures if

490
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,678
anything kind of just made me want to

491
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,020
say that the tech is really just a kind

492
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,080
of another substrate to try and build

493
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:43,100
new social coordination models the one

494
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,408
and there's a really interesting tension

495
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,439
that kind of arises out of this but

496
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:50,990
there also arose out of actually trying

497
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,299
to take this original concept of Terror

498
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:56,149
zero and actually trying to implement it

499
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:58,879
and that tension is actually something

500
00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:00,678
that is also maybe a tension that exists

501
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,720
within you know much of the crypto

502
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:04,010
community or at least the kind of like

503
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,440
the crypto community that are kind of

504
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:09,669
more looking towards the or relying or

505
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,600
building among the kind of the political

506
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,640
the political and the kind of like

507
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,949
parallel society aims of people like the

508
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,230
cypherpunks or you know kind of like

509
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:23,000
relying on an Agora see maybe philosophy

510
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:27,130
in some sense and that's what this

511
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,539
interaction with the legal world is so

512
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,309
what we kind of have seen out of what's

513
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:34,010
happening with Dow's and also what we

514
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:36,500
found from tera zero was where that

515
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,908
limit or like what the scope of autonomy

516
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:43,159
that like blockchain tech an actually

517
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:46,250
give you and so even though we talked

518
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:50,809
about granting ownership rights to a

519
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:52,399
dowel in our original concept paper kind

520
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,889
of as an experiment with non human

521
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:56,719
autonomy in some sense but also kind of

522
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,990
going back to the the Szabo point I had

523
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,429
earlier as a kind of security measure

524
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,470
against the land being taken away by

525
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:08,000
kind of making it impossible for the

526
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:10,789
land to be granted to someone else with

527
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,980
the use of real estate or the

528
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:16,309
interaction between real estate or

529
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:18,830
physical space and kind of having some

530
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:20,210
kind of ownership denoted in the way

531
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,520
that we usually do within the kind of

532
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,049
purely digital realm especially within

533
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,570
the realm of kind of cryptocurrencies

534
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:28,250
and cryptography were key accessor like

535
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,289
key access actually just denotes

536
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,980
ownership those two things are wildly

537
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,980
different and

538
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,240
you have to interact on some level with

539
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,460
existing legal frameworks if you're

540
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,200
trying to integrate buildings or land

541
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,680
with any kind of blockchain based

542
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,200
application simply because the state who

543
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,570
said the laws have the monopoly of force

544
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,540
at the moment so regardless of how good

545
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,129
or how well thought out you're kind of

546
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,990
you know your your your cryptographic

547
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,370
substrate is if they don't want you to

548
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,110
have the land or don't recognize you is

549
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,239
having it then you don't have it in

550
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,159
their eyes and they will take it away

551
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,880
from you and there are quite a few

552
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,290
groups that are starting to engage with

553
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
this in different ways so there's a

554
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,700
group called des Antrim who are based in

555
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,880
Zurich who are currently kind of setting

556
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,510
up the prototype for a building which is

557
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,160
actually owned and it's processes are

558
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,740
kind of mediated via a series of smart

559
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,360
contracts so they're working quite

560
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,180
extent and they are actually working

561
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,030
with legislators in in Switzerland and I

562
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,340
believe and there are also groups like

563
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,530
koala who is setting up kind of what

564
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,780
they call is like minimum viable legal

565
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:42,420
interfacing for dowels so how can you

566
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,740
have dows existing without bringing the

567
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,210
whole thing into the kind of legal

568
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,060
structure that they were basically in

569
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:50,850
village to you know to help people get

570
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,950
out of but how can they in the the ways

571
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,870
they need to actually still interact

572
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,390
with this so you can actually build with

573
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:58,560
them and both of these projects are

574
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,380
still kind of starting out so it'd be

575
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:06,690
very interesting to see where they go

576
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:11,970
but the kind of TL DR of this kind of

577
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:13,560
these two kind of chunks of findings

578
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:17,760
that I've just thrown at you is that

579
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:19,409
basically crypto won't actually in and

580
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,270
of itself necessarily solves the issue

581
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,890
so what we need to kind of look at with

582
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,320
building these kind of counter

583
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,030
ecological tactics is how can we very

584
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,139
very strategically apply it and very

585
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:35,700
strategically use it to kind of bolster

586
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,110
either existing social relations and you

587
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,270
know kind of stuff like guerilla

588
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:44,010
gardening or stuff like the project the

589
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:46,290
call Hess was involved in and how can we

590
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,990
essentially use it to bolster like this

591
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:51,960
or relations that already exist or bring

592
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,460
about new tiny technological solutions

593
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,020
that kind of can incrementally help us

594
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,480
build up into building something new and

595
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:00,420
autonomous from the things we wish to

596
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,880
gain autonomy from so what are the

597
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,890
actual uses of censorship resistant tech

598
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,820
or autonomous infrastructure and how

599
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,890
could they apply be applied to augment

600
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:15,240
already existing ecological cancer

601
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:17,640
economic actions and I want to finish

602
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,500
the talk by going through two other

603
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,410
iterations of Terror zero that we did

604
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,880
last year and kind of highlighting some

605
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,350
of the mechanisms that we were playing

606
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,030
with and also hopefully some of the ways

607
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,010
that we could kind of expand either kind

608
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,320
of like vertically or horizontally going

609
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:34,710
back to to pare Boylan's point from

610
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,000
before and the first of these was a

611
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,960
project that we call flower tokens which

612
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,580
in a certain sense you could

613
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,820
conceptualize as a black market for

614
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,139
flowers which it was very much a

615
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:49,850
small-scale experiment that was actually

616
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:53,640
also a technical experiment looking at

617
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:57,810
natural resource tokenization which led

618
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:00,720
to recognitions actually of a lot of the

619
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:02,490
or recognizing a lot of the limits that

620
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,940
actually came with crypto and how it

621
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:08,160
actually really interacted with complex

622
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,930
forms of social coordination even within

623
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,900
this kind of like turret tiny control

624
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:14,220
case experiment so it was an

625
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,040
installation that was built in trust

626
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,400
which was a co-working space in Berlin

627
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,970
and the system had 100 that's the point

628
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,020
yeah

629
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:28,400
so I had $100 in it and was basically

630
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:31,080
just in this 4 by 5 rack and it had a

631
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,000
kind of semi automated watering system

632
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,260
as you can see down here and I say semi

633
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,260
automated because we still have to

634
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,720
really up I kind of maintain it and this

635
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,370
shot or these two camera shots which you

636
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,300
can actually kind of just about see

637
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:47,340
there this shot itself is from this

638
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:52,379
camera position of that so it was

639
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:55,409
monitored 24/7 by this camera and in

640
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,600
contrast to the first tera 0 forest it

641
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,550
really just focused on one aspect which

642
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,399
was this how do we actually kind of like

643
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,740
tow

644
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,450
real-world assets what is actually

645
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,610
necessary to tokenize because obviously

646
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,380
the process of just tokenizing

647
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:11,620
everything because you can actually in

648
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,270
itself is really something to avoid but

649
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,219
what is that what are the very small

650
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:17,020
useful pieces of information that we can

651
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:22,660
tokenize and how can we use them or why

652
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:24,550
would we use them and basically this is

653
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,540
the web interface that we set up for it

654
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:29,710
where users were able to buy trade and

655
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:35,040
speculate on these kind of tokenize

656
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:38,350
dahlias and the state of the tokens

657
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,149
sorry so as we see here just very simple

658
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,860
stuff like whether it's blooming the

659
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,940
height its growth rate over the previous

660
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,389
days

661
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,070
these were monitored by the camera that

662
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,170
came before so we had a program running

663
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,740
plant CV which is just a plant

664
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:59,620
specialized model of OpenCV in orders at

665
00:27:53,740 --> 00:28:01,720
which updated it every 24 hours and yep

666
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,800
so the system just ran for three months

667
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,580
like I said it was a very small-scale

668
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,230
technical experiment and the initially

669
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:11,800
we sold all of the flowers for naught

670
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:14,130
point ninety which at the time I think

671
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:19,389
was about thirty euros I can't remember

672
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:20,620
and the highest the one that sold

673
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,990
highest on the first day actually sold

674
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:26,050
for 450 euros which was kind of bizarre

675
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:28,300
and users could then burn their tokens

676
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:30,360
and get their plants out of the system

677
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,580
which actually quite a few people did

678
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,100
which is maybe like a an interesting

679
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:38,590
little small-scale thing where a lot of

680
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,449
people just wanted to keep the token but

681
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,620
then a lot some people actually wanted

682
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,110
to burn this oak and get out of the

683
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,750
system which if you just view a token as

684
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:49,419
an abstract digital twin of a real-life

685
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:56,590
thing is interesting see who did and who

686
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:57,940
didn't and okay yep so basically this

687
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:01,270
was some of the plant cv information

688
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,680
that was gathered and these are just

689
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:06,310
some kind of prepping pictures of us

690
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,510
actually planting it so - and these are

691
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:11,300
kind of in there just to reinforce this

692
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:13,430
idea that even though from

693
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,740
these pictures it looks like a perfectly

694
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,940
encapsulated autonomous system actually

695
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,470
even trying to set something up as

696
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,870
small-scale as having a hundred flowers

697
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,370
in Iraq and an automated grow and kind

698
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,409
of like an automated watering system

699
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:27,469
involved a lot of people doing a lot of

700
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,360
work this is Marcus taking one of his

701
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:31,610
plans out and I included this picture

702
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,280
because one of the things this also

703
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,990
showed us was you can't be too strict

704
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,300
with your technology when you're

705
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:41,240
engaging with nature because as you

706
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,770
might be able to see all of the plants

707
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,650
basically started growing way too high

708
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:47,120
so actually our kind of computer

709
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,250
verification mechanism of actually

710
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,800
having everything processed by OpenCV

711
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,510
started failing because everything just

712
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:58,879
started kind of smashing together into

713
00:29:53,510 --> 00:30:00,830
one mass or against the ceiling and so

714
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,270
kind of taking some of this and taking

715
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,189
some of this knowledge and seeing okay

716
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,050
these are the limits of maybe why we

717
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,520
shouldn't try to mediate everything to

718
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:10,879
strictly or monitor everything to

719
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,840
strictly we then built a project called

720
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,150
pram not even which is kind of or was

721
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,889
examining the kind of emergent

722
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:21,440
possibilities of like human and non in

723
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,910
human interaction on the most granular

724
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,820
level we could think of trying it out

725
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:31,610
and this was basically using a software

726
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,740
framework using a decentralized software

727
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:36,530
framework to allow for kind of a

728
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,250
technologically augmented organic system

729
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,790
to engage in social and financial

730
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,370
contracts with the broader environment

731
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,540
so kind of harkening back to the idea

732
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,189
that we were playing within the concept

733
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,590
paper but really stripping it down into

734
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,000
okay cool we have a bonsai tree that's

735
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:54,350
doing this instead of an entire forest

736
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,560
which is also far more financially

737
00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:00,050
feasible as well so it started off as an

738
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,020
installation and a prototype that was at

739
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:05,300
the shingle pavilion in Berlin and the

740
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:09,230
system itself just consisted of a bonsai

741
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:12,680
tree a web interface which this is a

742
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:14,960
better picture of quite a few sensors

743
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,300
like two of them you can see here which

744
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,620
kind of existed in this ring that was

745
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,899
sitting around it and it's kind of

746
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:25,518
enclosure and a small contract and

747
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:27,439
these software and hardware systems that

748
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,690
it was embedded within we kind of

749
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,179
envisaged as almost like technological

750
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:36,320
prosti prosthesis which allowed it to

751
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:38,510
which allowed for this creation of like

752
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,370
a financially mediated social contract

753
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:43,519
into being between the operators of

754
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,539
whatever space it was in and tremana the

755
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,960
tree itself

756
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:49,940
so basically when people committed to

757
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,940
having the tree in their space they

758
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:56,120
committed to care for the needs of from

759
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,580
the diamond which are watering trimming

760
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,678
trimming its leaves making sure it has

761
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,949
enough electricity making sure it has

762
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,750
enough server space and the open Bazaar

763
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,279
Edition at the bottom was just a bit of

764
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,679
a wild-card where people could donate to

765
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:14,049
it and it would buy like nicer tools for

766
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:16,519
itself to be trimmed with which is and

767
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:18,080
the way that prama pays for this is that

768
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:19,909
people engaging with it on the web

769
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,220
interface so as we can see here you know

770
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:25,039
I know this is just Prem not paying for

771
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,740
all this stuff basically you could go

772
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,080
into the web interface and you could

773
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,700
donate a bit of money to it so the idea

774
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,840
of being that when it didn't have that

775
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,059
much electricity left

776
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,709
hopefully someone would come in and give

777
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:39,950
it you know 50 cents worth of ether and

778
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:42,470
then Prem there would ping the owners of

779
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:46,010
the space it was in and say hey here's

780
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:49,970
some money can you water me or something

781
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:53,779
like that and so this was kind of an

782
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:56,450
attempt to position a very small

783
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:58,429
ecological system as instead of being a

784
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,649
passive object that needed caring for

785
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:02,480
and constantly had to have humans

786
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:05,389
watching it it was more that pramana

787
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,539
demon was a way of starting to explore

788
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:10,340
the potential of non-human systems to

789
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:13,399
actually kind of gain the state as the

790
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,500
vasami autonomous peer so instead of

791
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:18,830
having the interactions between human

792
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:21,350
actors and the system into like a purely

793
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,789
financial eyes way it shows that you can

794
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,830
maybe make an autonomous system that

795
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:27,379
humans have to interact with on the same

796
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:30,320
level of a social contract as I would

797
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,299
were I to be buying a coffee from peril

798
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,980
only paulus even though there is a

799
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:35,510
financial transaction there it is

800
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,080
actually still essentially a social

801
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,680
relation

802
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,300
that is financially mediated maybe and

803
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,090
actually what we kind of wanted to do

804
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:47,350
with this and this was toured

805
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:50,179
successfully for over a year now yeah

806
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,919
not only can you actually create this

807
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,780
kind of very minimal non human autonomy

808
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,790
but you can actually crowd fund it just

809
00:33:53,780 --> 00:34:00,050
from strangers on the internet as well

810
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:01,909
and so I suppose the conclusion of this

811
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,290
or what we can then bring what we're

812
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,740
kind of trying to elucidate as these

813
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:10,600
tactics and bring into this still very

814
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:13,310
nascent notion of counter ecologies is

815
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,170
some of these mechanisms we can use to

816
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:17,570
kind of at least maybe tactically

817
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:18,679
bolster some of the ideas that I talked

818
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,600
about before so these guerrilla

819
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,720
ecological work or like self organized

820
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:26,480
farming initiatives we can maybe take

821
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:29,089
from art pieces like Fender demon and

822
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,880
then actually give some form of new

823
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:35,390
financial or new social autonomy to

824
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:37,820
these projects or at least enable them

825
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,020
to kind of start existing outside of the

826
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:52,070
restrictive systems that they're

827
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:54,860
currently placed in Thanks okay thank

828
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:57,200
you max thank you for the for the

829
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,990
presentation and now we have a time for

830
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,779
a few questions so anybody in the

831
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:05,959
audience would like to ask and follow on

832
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:11,210
topics on counter ecologists okay thank

833
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:13,940
you hi thanks for the presentation I'm

834
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:17,300
not familiar with dolls so I would like

835
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:19,930
to ask in the case of pram Nam

836
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,460
is there an artificial intelligence

837
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:25,040
involved that's taking decisions for

838
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,020
example it sees one day left for

839
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,860
electricity one they left her water

840
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:35,270
okay which one prioritizes and does it

841
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:37,490
how does it decide for itself okay so

842
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:40,610
that's kind of a two-pronged question no

843
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:42,049
there's no there's no AI even mission

844
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,810
nothing and there really is just Python

845
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:46,820
libraries so in terms of the

846
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,140
differentiation between okay cool so I

847
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,800
have this much left for water and this

848
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,400
much left for electricity

849
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,900
we actually didn't we didn't actually

850
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,280
build that into it wasn't all just one

851
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,210
wallet that it was going into there were

852
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:02,310
each separate little wallet right so and

853
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:06,089
that was kind of partially done just to

854
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:09,000
see what people prioritized above other

855
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:10,470
things because for instance on the

856
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,660
screenshot that I had before electricity

857
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,368
was always running really really low but

858
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,540
for instance and trimming it as well

859
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:17,339
which is something you have to do to

860
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,170
keep the bonsai healthy was usually

861
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:22,049
quite low but people would always pay

862
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,400
for water so it was a certain also

863
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,900
seeing how you can split up the

864
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,790
different social interactions just to

865
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,320
see what would happen

866
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:32,220
luckily we were never in a situation

867
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,710
where the system would have died so so

868
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:37,649
you had different wallets for different

869
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:40,800
needs so this is okay because I thought

870
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:44,760
there was a pool that money pours in and

871
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,710
then this Dao decided itself ok and the

872
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,190
decisions were just the decisions were

873
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:52,080
super super simple so we just had a we

874
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,760
just have like a soil moisture sensor in

875
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,290
the pot for instance and just knew that

876
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,589
it had to keep between a certain level

877
00:36:55,290 --> 00:37:00,119
okay thanks know it obviously you could

878
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:04,700
expand this massively but just at the

879
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,700
time it was very minimal just as an idea

880
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:12,060
hello I know the talk is about well

881
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:14,520
closed ecosystems keeping in mind that

882
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,009
you are a colonist person I would like

883
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:21,480
to know your thoughts about global

884
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:24,150
warming and how the media is approaching

885
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,190
that topic how the other media is

886
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,910
approaching little bit yeah creator Tom

887
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:34,020
Berg and all that kind of things

888
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:38,220
I mean complex questions to a sort of

889
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:39,540
big question um I suppose the way that I

890
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:45,419
would kind of like ground it within this

891
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:48,720
is the the idea of a synth like the idea

892
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,980
of a single consistent narrative with

893
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,500
regards that global warming is actually

894
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,790
kind of in and of itself a little bit

895
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,460
ridiculous because obviously you can't

896
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,970
it's far too complex a phenomenon to

897
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,770
actually like view as a single entity

898
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,788
but also in terms of the possibilities

899
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:06,839
for action

900
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:10,529
and I'll very specifically say that this

901
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,179
idea of the individuation of the

902
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:13,739
responsibility of climate change of the

903
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:15,239
idea that everyone should use plastic

904
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:18,539
straws and actually it's really your

905
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:21,179
fault not people who own jets or you

906
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:24,150
know like what have the 100 companies

907
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:26,519
that have 71 that basically commit 71%

908
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:30,179
of all the co2 emissions and all of this

909
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:32,279
I would like that individuation of the

910
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:34,679
narrative is kind of ridiculous but then

911
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:37,619
and then it sounds slightly paradoxical

912
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:40,439
to a certain extent but you or you can

913
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,569
do as well outside of there are like two

914
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:47,189
tactics you could basically take you

915
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:48,959
could go down the route of engaging with

916
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:50,699
that issue so you have a hundred

917
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:53,339
companies that contribute a massive

918
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:57,329
amount of co2 and trying to engage with

919
00:38:53,339 --> 00:39:00,749
that on some level or you could also

920
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:03,209
work maybe in a way that's more akin to

921
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:04,979
what people like but kind of like the

922
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:07,948
solar punk movement are essentially

923
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:09,029
advocating which is like okay cool the

924
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:10,439
solutions aren't going to come from the

925
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:12,539
top down so maybe we just have to build

926
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:14,848
and bomb up and obviously this will

927
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:17,219
start off I was like a series of look

928
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:18,630
how based things but hopefully that

929
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:23,519
thing can spread and become some kind of

930
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:24,869
a network yeah I suppose that's all I'd

931
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:26,249
throw up sorry it was a bit of a

932
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:27,809
curveball of a question so that might

933
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:31,288
have been a massively incoherent answer

934
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:33,569
as well but yeah okay maybe follow the

935
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:35,339
animals response here to the Greta which

936
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:37,650
was published I think two days ago or so

937
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:41,269
so a little last question who would like

938
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,269
to have okay

939
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,850
yeah thanks we'll talk like my questions

940
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:52,129
a bit so you're trying to build yourself

941
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:56,569
governing or self-organizing plant

942
00:39:52,130 --> 00:40:00,230
system or like maintaining and yeah I

943
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:02,450
mean these were sorry yeah so and maybe

944
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,310
this has wrong words but like so ease

945
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,080
are you trying to kind of take the human

946
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:09,230
out of the loop like and then my

947
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,060
question is why and if you're not trying

948
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,130
to take the human out of the loop then

949
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,779
it's my questions like why are you doing

950
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:17,030
this because in the end boils down to

951
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,680
people trying to preserve nature and

952
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,050
people not trying to preserve nature and

953
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:26,060
why building this restricted system

954
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:31,369
around it or smart contracts and yeah I

955
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:34,250
suppose answer to that would be it's not

956
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:36,760
really we're not trying to do it in as

957
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:38,990
polarized away as that I mean like

958
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,240
obviously the the work that we were

959
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,709
presenting there is incredibly polarized

960
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,109
because they were kind of presented as

961
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:48,050
these experiments that were presented

962
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:51,319
within an hour context right so it was

963
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:53,000
more about on a broader level what kind

964
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,740
of mechanisms can you actually take out

965
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,140
of that so for instance with Bremner or

966
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,939
if you you can just have a system where

967
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,740
people can pay into it maybe people who

968
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,260
aren't actually attached to the projects

969
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:06,770
at all which is an idea that actually

970
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:10,220
came from the forgot the name of the

971
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:13,100
piece now it was essentially that the

972
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,689
tele garden so it was like a robot arm

973
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:17,210
that was like looking after a garden

974
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:19,600
that people could control from anywhere

975
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,859
in the world over the Internet and

976
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,830
instead of kind of trying to completely

977
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:26,990
remove the humans or and kind of

978
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:28,490
completely automate everything it's more

979
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:31,029
of like where can these little things

980
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:34,609
fit in that maybe you could for instance

981
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:36,290
in a more transparent way like crowdfund

982
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:37,730
or you can automate certain aspects of

983
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,020
it there could then mean that like five

984
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,950
people could actually run a far larger

985
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:44,660
area of a garden or something like that

986
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,980
so it's really just kind of like looking

987
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,810
at where you can slap this stuff in and

988
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,150
experimenting with those as opposed to

989
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,410
trying to completely remove people from

990
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,740
it and completely automate everything

991
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:56,690
because that's not either necessary or

992
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,459
like technically feasible so it's really

993
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,470
just kind of

994
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,510
anything with okay you have certain

995
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:02,919
forms of autonomy that started to come

996
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,089
about with stuff like dolls with stuff

997
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,950
like small contracts I know that these

998
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:07,180
are experiments as well these aren't

999
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,919
necessarily things to be scaled and

1000
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,799
reproduced but it's to be learned from

1001
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,780
and maybe you learn not to do that

1002
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,640
I think with some of the stuff there are

1003
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,720
certain structural mechanisms we could

1004
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:24,670
at least take from it does that is that

1005
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:26,140
yeah okay before I think to max I would

1006
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,770
like just paint up if somebody would

1007
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,839
like to follow this discussion maybe I

1008
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:34,150
definitely recommend you at 7:00 if I'm

1009
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,880
right guys from parallel garden project

1010
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:39,310
VG's para una police base will introduce

1011
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,260
you into their work however gear have

1012
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:43,299
they work in hydroponics or the project

1013
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:45,670
of the fan bot so definitely at 7:00 at

1014
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,710
Institute of krypton RG but now I would

1015
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:49,810
like to definitely thank to Marx for his

1016
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:52,000
presentation and I hope that with this

1017
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:54,369
project he will not just inspire other

1018
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,690
people to think about Contra ecology but

1019
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:57,910
I was more thinking maybe a little bit

1020
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:59,380
infect them you know because that's the

1021
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,149
approach I think we need anymore

1022
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,540
okay so thank you and thank you guys for

1023
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,540
coming

1024
