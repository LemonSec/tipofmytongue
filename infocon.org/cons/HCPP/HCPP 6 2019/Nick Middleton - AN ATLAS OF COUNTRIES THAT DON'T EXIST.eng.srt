00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:33,019
very significant guest speaker is in

4
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:45,890
front of us I would like to welcome at

5
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:50,750
HDCP mr. Nick Middleton welcome Nick is

6
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:54,000
researcher and traveler and geographer

7
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:57,479
who also teaches at Oxford University

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,670
and he's author of many very interesting

9
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,409
and significant books and one of them

10
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:08,040
that you can also get here at HC P P

11
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:11,850
also in Czech trance translation is

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,260
called a little atlas of countries that

13
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:19,110
don't exist and the same topic as a

14
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,229
theme of his talk where he's gonna talk

15
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:27,960
about countries and micronations that

16
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:30,000
try to achieve an optic out of countries

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,350
they are part of and have different

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,560
struggles with that and Nick is going to

19
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:41,130
select a couple of examples of that that

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,780
are really fun for our Congress and

21
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,869
thank you very much that you accepted

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,870
invitation and pass the word thank you

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,710
good evening everybody I'm very pleased

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,158
to be here in praha for the first time

25
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,600
in more than 30 years I have to say I

26
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,380
was here in 1989

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,960
by mistake I happen to see the first day

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,288
of the well the first evening of the

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,150
Velvet Revolution as it turned out but

30
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,670
this evening I'm going to give you a

31
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,640
talk based on a recent book of mine

32
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:21,298
called a country an atlas of countries

33
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,899
that don't exist and in the next 40

34
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:27,269
minutes I hope to introduce you to a few

35
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,970
places that you may never have heard of

36
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:34,410
I want to outline to you what it is to

37
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,510
be a country what a country actually

38
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,859
means and it's by no means

39
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,340
straightforward

40
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,040
and also give you give you some tips for

41
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,460
starting your own country should you so

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,280
desire

43
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:51,540
although the tips do not come with any

44
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:55,410
guarantees of success so I'm a

45
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:58,620
geographer let's start with a map that's

46
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,400
the conventional world political map

47
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:06,150
that we are all familiar with and it's

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,920
designed by the countries shown there to

49
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,760
give you the impression that every

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,329
square meter of the Earth's land surface

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,920
is accounted for those solid nice blocks

52
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:23,010
of color indicate that Argentina is in

53
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,429
charge of that part of South America

54
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:30,299
Namibia owns and controls this part so

55
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:32,790
on and so forth but I would suggest to

56
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,270
you that this map is actually a bit of a

57
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:40,679
confidence trick because what this map

58
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:43,380
conceals is almost as many countries

59
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,410
that would like to pier appear on the

60
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:50,010
map but do not countries that would like

61
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,799
to join the elite group of nation states

62
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,829
that have representation at the United

63
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,060
Nations and I think it's fair to point

64
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,680
out that this map is by no means static

65
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:05,220
in the last 30 years or so there's been

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,280
quite a big series of changes so that at

67
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,760
the end of the Soviet Union for example

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,549
gave birth to 15 new countries in the

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,810
early 1990s some countries became

70
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:22,860
reunited so Germany and Yemen in 1990

71
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:25,410
three years later as we all know we were

72
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,620
standing in Czechoslovakia and then

73
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,990
suddenly it became Czech Republic as

74
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:34,080
Slovakia split off a similar thing

75
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,169
happened in Ethiopia in the same year

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,090
when Eritrea took over the portion in

77
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:46,020
the Red Sea and more new countries have

78
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:49,950
appeared in the 21st century in Asia in

79
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,349
Europe and in Africa so the world

80
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,479
political map

81
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:58,520
is a changeable feast it's by no means

82
00:04:53,480 --> 00:05:01,640
static if you go back to the beginning

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,099
of the 20th century Europe politically

84
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,880
looked very different from the Europe we

85
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,620
know today so it was a Russian Empire

86
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,450
Germany was very much larger than it is

87
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,260
now of course there was austro-hungarian

88
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:19,010
Empire the Ottoman Empire and northern

89
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,170
Africa was all controlled by European

90
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,150
powers

91
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:26,060
fast forward a hundred years to the

92
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,890
beginning of the 21st century all of

93
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:33,080
those empires have more or less

94
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:36,620
disappeared the northern African margin

95
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,870
they're all independent nation states so

96
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,710
the map has changed quite dramatically

97
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:45,800
in that period of a hundred years and of

98
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:48,080
course the map continues to change we

99
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,780
all know where members of the European

100
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,849
Union I might not be in a very short

101
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:58,700
time but the European Union in a sense

102
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,640
has been designed to do away with some

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:05,320
of the powers associated with individual

104
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,390
nation states and we hear a lot of about

105
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,710
globalization and the end of the

106
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:12,979
nation-state so national boundaries

107
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:15,979
matter relatively little within the EU

108
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,080
to the movement of investment and goods

109
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,990
it's rather different if you're a person

110
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,390
or a migrant trying to get in but to

111
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:27,080
investment in goods national boundaries

112
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:30,469
don't mean that much anymore national

113
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,419
governments also compete with a range of

114
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,420
other organizations such as global

115
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,310
transnational corporations

116
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:40,610
nongovernmental organizations that also

117
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,470
have a global reach and of course we

118
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,640
know about the transnational networks

119
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:48,860
fuelled by information technology if I

120
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,840
whatsapp one of you in the crowd it

121
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,230
really doesn't matter what country I'm

122
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:58,789
what's happing from or which country you

123
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:01,669
are in and therefore there's been a lot

124
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:04,490
of movement towards this idea of

125
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:05,270
globalization spelling the end of the

126
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,530
nation-state

127
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:12,198
so is it the end of the nation-state are

128
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:15,258
these the early stages of that process I

129
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,470
would suggest perhaps not quite just yet

130
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:20,380
so the United Kingdom have decided to

131
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,419
withdraw from the European Union and

132
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,599
re-establish its national credentials

133
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:28,520
and of course the United Kingdom I've

134
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,610
lost count of the number of times I've

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,190
tried to explain how the United Kingdom

136
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,599
works to people who are unfamiliar with

137
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,880
it

138
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,300
Scotland is part of the United Kingdom

139
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,909
but they had a referendum in 2014 about

140
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,530
leaving the United Kingdom so by no

141
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:50,419
means is the UK are done and dusted and

142
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:53,059
then there are other aspects

143
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:56,448
non-political aspects for which being

144
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,060
member of a country is still very

145
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:01,729
important so this Brazilian crowd if

146
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,889
they weren't part of Brazil they

147
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:07,729
wouldn't feel that national identity as

148
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:10,159
a football crowd as they do for any

149
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:14,380
other unit so the end of the

150
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:19,969
nation-state probably it's not quite yet

151
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:22,669
- as we speak this is an interesting

152
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:24,409
question as a geographer I should be

153
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,880
able to answer it but it's actually

154
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:31,209
rather difficult surprisingly difficult

155
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,309
so there are a hundred and ninety five

156
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:38,149
members of the United Nations actually

157
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:41,659
that's not quite true there are 193 UN

158
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:47,329
member states plus two UN observer

159
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:52,069
States however there are 206 Olympic

160
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:55,880
nations 206 National Olympic Committee's

161
00:08:52,070 --> 00:09:00,709
if you look at football soccer the

162
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:03,829
world's biggest game there are 209 FIFA

163
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:06,229
countries and then if you look at the

164
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:09,020
ISA of the international standards

165
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,870
organization which is a transnational

166
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,589
body that maintains standards for all

167
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:18,500
sorts of things there are no fewer than

168
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:20,480
249 country codes so

169
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,760
you ask yourself this question how many

170
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,440
countries are there and it's actually

171
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,439
surprisingly difficult to answer

172
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:34,100
here's another surprisingly different

173
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:36,500
question to answer what is a country or

174
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,780
what is a nation or what is a state and

175
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,570
often those three words are used more or

176
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,339
less interchangeably and sometimes

177
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,740
they're bolted together so you hear talk

178
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,630
about the nation state well for

179
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,230
different people they're different

180
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,540
things and we colleagues of mine at

181
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:58,070
Oxford who are interested in in cultural

182
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:01,550
geography use the word nation as a as a

183
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,860
token of cultural assimilation so people

184
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,550
who speak a common language and have

185
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:10,120
other common aspects of culture for an

186
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,430
economist the state is different again

187
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,850
if you're a member of a football crowd

188
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:21,760
again you may be different and although

189
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:25,460
there are many different definitions

190
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,819
they're all full of anomalies and

191
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:33,890
exceptions and when it comes down to it

192
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:36,260
there is no universally accepted common

193
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:42,319
definition of what makes a country a

194
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:44,210
country which might surprise you you

195
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,860
might think that membership of the

196
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,250
United Nations should be the gold

197
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,320
standard because it's the the Club for

198
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,210
sovereign states if you're a sovereign

199
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,220
state and you remember the United

200
00:10:53,210 --> 00:11:01,130
Nations there's no question your country

201
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:04,490
well yes and then again no Israel became

202
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:07,160
a member of the UN in 1949 but a large

203
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,590
number of countries don't recognize the

204
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,010
existence of Israel they just don't

205
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:15,320
recognize that it exists at all

206
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:19,760
likewise Palestine more recently has

207
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,680
become a UN observer state but an even

208
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,390
larger number of countries don't

209
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:30,140
recognize the existence of Palestine and

210
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:31,819
then there's my own country now I was

211
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:36,140
born in England

212
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,540
I have a UK passport but England from

213
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,530
the perspective of the United Nations is

214
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,930
not a country

215
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:45,260
it only has a seat at the United Nations

216
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:48,770
as a member of the United Kingdom and

217
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:52,250
the United Kingdom is made up of England

218
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:55,780
Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland and

219
00:11:52,250 --> 00:12:00,200
then there's another anomalous situation

220
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:05,750
called Taiwan that for a long time

221
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:08,180
Taiwan had the UN seat for China as only

222
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,950
one China everyone agrees on the fact

223
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:14,329
that there's only one China Taiwan and

224
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:18,050
mainland China and up until the 70s in

225
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:21,740
the 1970s Taiwan had that UN seat for

226
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,540
China and then in 1971 or the other UN

227
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,670
member states decided that actually it

228
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,410
shouldn't be Taiwan at all it should be

229
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:34,579
mainland China so they kicked Taiwan out

230
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:35,630
so is Taiwan a country I bet I haven't

231
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,030
checked this up I should have done a

232
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:42,170
better public does not have an embassy

233
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:44,060
in Taiwan the UK doesn't most countries

234
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,010
do not have embassies there they don't

235
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,650
recognize it as a country because they

236
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,850
don't want to upset mainland China

237
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,770
that's not to say that they don't have

238
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,050
trade delegations which behave

239
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,880
suspiciously like embassies but

240
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,400
nonetheless technically they do not

241
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,560
recognize Taiwan there is a small

242
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,480
handful of states that do they tend to

243
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,599
be very small

244
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,490
often island states who get big handouts

245
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,400
from Taiwan for maintaining diplomatic

246
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:14,060
relations but there are many more states

247
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,400
who do not recognize Taiwan as a country

248
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:21,410
so even UN membership is by no means

249
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:24,110
clear cut now in legal terms there's

250
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,209
this convention called the Montevideo

251
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:31,010
convention on the rights and duties of

252
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:35,300
states and it was created in the 1930s

253
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:38,480
and I article one as a series of

254
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,990
criteria for statehood so to be a state

255
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,850
you need a permanent population you need

256
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,290
a different territory you need some form

257
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,470
of government and the cup

258
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,099
Cassity to enter into relations with the

259
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,740
other states

260
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,800
that's pretty woolly but nonetheless in

261
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,620
legal terms this is recognized by knows

262
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,279
most nation states so let's have a look

263
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:05,870
at an example northern cyprus so up

264
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:10,029
until the mid 70s or in the sixties and

265
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:13,279
early seventies this place ver russia

266
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:15,949
was the place to be seen on the beach in

267
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,709
the Mediterranean it was where all the

268
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:22,699
glitterati the Hollywood stars went to

269
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:25,819
sunbathe and then in 1974 everything

270
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:29,449
changed because there was the arrival of

271
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:33,229
some Turkish Armed Forces notice I said

272
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:37,160
arrival so as you probably know Cyprus

273
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,740
is split in community-wise between

274
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,350
Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots to

275
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,709
Turkish Cypriots these people these

276
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,470
these troops liberated their land to

277
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:50,689
Greek Cypriots they were invaders either

278
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,850
way however you look at it in 1974

279
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,100
everything changed and there was a mass

280
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,709
movement of Greek Cypriots from the

281
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:02,449
north to the south and Turkish Cypriots

282
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:07,279
moved to Northern Cyprus and this line

283
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:10,370
between them became in 1974 a no-go zone

284
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,589
and it's still a no-go zone so the best

285
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:16,490
beach on Cyprus has not had any

286
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:18,680
sunbathers on it since 1974 it's a no-go

287
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,649
zone that's what it looks like

288
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,138
occasionally photographers most creep in

289
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:27,319
and take some shots that's the main

290
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:29,510
street of Russia in the late 60s there

291
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:33,290
it is I think that photo was taken in

292
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:35,300
the early 2000s everything stopped so

293
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:38,930
that's a car showroom with all the

294
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:41,029
latest mid seventies models so that's

295
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,388
the boundary you can move between the

296
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:46,939
two but there's a this forbidden zone

297
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,160
between them nonetheless if you want to

298
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:51,170
you can go to North Cyprus for your

299
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,019
holiday still you can't go to that Beach

300
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,779
but there are other beaches don't worry

301
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:59,180
you can send a postcard home from

302
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:02,380
Northern Cyprus where the North's

303
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:06,020
pria stamp there is a choice of two

304
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,090
guide books in English you can't use

305
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,100
northern Cypriot money it's some the

306
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,980
currency they use is the Turkish lira

307
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:16,610
and that's because Turkey recognizes

308
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:19,430
Northern Cyprus but no one else does you

309
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,380
can't fly there directly other than from

310
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,150
Istanbul so if you wanted to go on

311
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,550
holiday to Northern Cyprus you either

312
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:29,240
have to fly to the south and then across

313
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,319
the border or you fly via Istanbul into

314
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,850
the northern cyprus

315
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,170
so other than Turkey no one recognises

316
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:41,180
Northern Cyprus as a country so

317
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:43,219
according to the Montevideo convention

318
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,319
it is a state because it's got a

319
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,450
population it's got a territory it's got

320
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,950
a government and it has the capacity to

321
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,000
enter into relations with other

322
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:56,690
governments and other states such as

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:01,850
Turkey but no one else recognize it is

324
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:04,400
the country there's another article in

325
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:07,030
the Montevideo convention that says the

326
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,440
political existence of the state is

327
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,270
independent of recognition by other

328
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,730
states so actually you don't have to

329
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,339
have recognition by anyone you can just

330
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,250
say right I've got a territory people

331
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,409
government and the capacity to enter

332
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,099
into relations that's it I don't

333
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:27,440
actually have to talk to anyone and yet

334
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:30,889
that recognition has become the sort of

335
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,710
gold standard by by which states like to

336
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:36,830
think of themselves as proper States by

337
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,980
being recognized by other states and for

338
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,800
that reason there are a number of sort

339
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,830
of mutual recognition clubs that have

340
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,110
been set up by an unrecognized countries

341
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,840
so there's this the Commonwealth the

342
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:54,080
shortened form is the Commonwealth of

343
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:57,230
unrecognized States for splinters of

344
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,350
what was the Soviet Union and then these

345
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,360
two at the bottom are much larger

346
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,879
organisations the u un so it's a

347
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:10,459
deliberate play on the United Nations as

348
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,950
is its logo and UNPO both have twenty

349
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,140
thirty more member

350
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,780
States member non states I don't know

351
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:21,080
how you put it but there there are a

352
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:25,129
number of these clubs for mutual

353
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:28,189
recognition of non countries in sporting

354
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:30,860
terms too there are a number of non FIFA

355
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,750
World Cups we all know how corrupt FIFA

356
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,810
is so it's good to hear that there are a

357
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:38,360
number of other ones there's a vive

358
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:40,760
World Cup currently held by a Kurdistan

359
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:45,050
which beat Northern Cyprus 2-1 in the

360
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:47,330
funnel there's a Fifi wild cup also

361
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:49,280
actually actually held by Northern

362
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,379
Cyprus in this case and there's the

363
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,490
perhaps the the the biggest one is the

364
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,640
conifer World Cup which was played out I

365
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,760
think that earlier this year actually

366
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:05,540
and in that case Northern Cyprus lost

367
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:09,110
3-2 on penalties in the final two carp

368
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:12,230
Italia which is a splinter of what most

369
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:16,310
people know as as hungry so there are

370
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:19,670
lots of these parallel organizations for

371
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:22,520
non countries so I had to come up with

372
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:25,670
some sort of rule of thumb for inclusion

373
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:29,570
within my atlas you know what do I don't

374
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:32,560
I regard to be a non country and I ended

375
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:35,600
up deciding that I'd have to follow the

376
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,909
Montevideo convention to some extent so

377
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,000
some form of government a claim to

378
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,160
territory a flag because the flag is

379
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,310
symbolically very important for

380
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,980
countries and would be countries and

381
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:50,899
some sort of seriousness of purpose and

382
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,230
I put that in in in my mind because

383
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,480
there are a lot of joke countries around

384
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,490
people declare independence for their

385
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,800
back garden and their front room and so

386
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,800
on and I didn't include those and yet I

387
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,889
still had 50 to put in my book and I

388
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,600
could have filled it several times over

389
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:11,720
in addition to those on the negative

390
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:15,310
side I didn't want places with a UN seat

391
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:19,910
so I didn't include Israel and Palestine

392
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:21,950
because for a number of reasons but not

393
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,530
least of which there are more countries

394
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,620
that do recognize those two places as

395
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,879
countries the

396
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:33,719
our than do not and therefore a lack of

397
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:37,400
widespread international recognition but

398
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,400
as I say I was spoilt for choice

399
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:47,130
when people talk about countries and

400
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,699
States there's also an inherent

401
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:53,250
understanding of the fact that states

402
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:57,080
governments exercise power and authority

403
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,990
they set standards they issue passports

404
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,120
they maintain law and order so they

405
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:07,830
issue rules and regulations and they

406
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:11,340
also patrol borders in many cases to

407
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,520
keep people out in some cases to keep

408
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:18,000
their own population in but this

409
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:21,660
exercise of power is undoubtedly part of

410
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,420
the makeup of being a country so what

411
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,210
happens then in a country where there is

412
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:29,580
no exercise of power where it's a

413
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:34,470
complete free-for-all let's go to

414
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:37,559
Somalia now since the mid-1980s so a

415
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:40,890
very long time at that so-called country

416
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:44,340
of Somalia has been a byword for chaos

417
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:48,210
for civil war for famine for the

418
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:51,030
complete breakdown of law and order but

419
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,980
and in the Western media that media

420
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:57,678
that's all we hear about there is a

421
00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:01,920
large slab of Somalia called Somaliland

422
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:05,370
which in 1990 declared independence from

423
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:09,620
the rest of Somalia based on the fact

424
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:12,689
that it had been a British protectorate

425
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:15,840
pre-1960 and the other slab of Somalia

426
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,210
had been Italian and Somaliland actually

427
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,959
declared independence as a country in

428
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,550
1964 six days by which time they decided

429
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,240
actually they join the with the rest of

430
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,669
Somalia but they had a really rough time

431
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,890
of the central government in Mogadishu

432
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:35,130
who sent make fighters in to bomb

433
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:37,260
Hargeisa in the 80s there was a civil

434
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,120
war so on and so forth and to cut a long

435
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,629
story short

436
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,679
Somaliland

437
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:47,220
which declared independence in 1991 has

438
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,590
been a haven of peace and tranquility

439
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,050
while all of the rest of the country as

440
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:55,340
I say has been a byword for chaos so

441
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:57,690
Somaliland has its own currency it

442
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:01,409
registers as its own vehicles

443
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:05,160
it has biometric passports and this

444
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:07,740
gentleman here is Mohamed Salah yo who

445
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:11,430
is that was there democratically elected

446
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:14,450
president they've had several so since

447
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:18,210
1991 it's been a haven of tranquility

448
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:21,540
well-organized virtually no warfare at

449
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:24,000
all in complete contrast to the rest of

450
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:27,510
the country and yet no one will

451
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,670
recognize them no one everyone still

452
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,770
Labor's on or everyone that the

453
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:34,230
international community still Labor's

454
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:39,860
under the delusion that Somalia is one

455
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,860
country but de-facto it's simply not

456
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:45,900
let's have a slightly different example

457
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:49,860
so as you saw Somalian land was large

458
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:52,020
hot river ain't it's small it's a

459
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,899
micronation it's in Western Australia

460
00:23:52,020 --> 00:24:00,060
and yet it's been around for a long time

461
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:01,770
in 1970 this husband and wife declared

462
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:05,040
independence for their wheat farm in

463
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:07,860
Western Australia why because they had

464
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,680
been told by the central government in

465
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,360
Canberra that they had to produce less

466
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,390
wheat or at least they couldn't sell as

467
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,850
much way today as they had been

468
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:20,850
producing they did their sums and

469
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,919
realized quite quickly that actually

470
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,300
they weren't going to make ends meet if

471
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,450
they weren't allowed to sell as much

472
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,310
wheat as they had been before so they

473
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:32,700
challenged it in the courts they went

474
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:35,040
through all sorts of legitimate avenues

475
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,120
to try and change this chain this

476
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:44,190
switched to their wheat quota also no

477
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,929
avail so in April 1970 they said right

478
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,970
we're not part of Australia anymore

479
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:53,390
we're going to call ourselves the Hutt

480
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:56,310
River province now you can imagine that

481
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:58,560
if this happens on your watch as a

482
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:02,790
national government it's well it's just

483
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:05,429
annoying isn't it to begin with to begin

484
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,930
with a central government tends to take

485
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:10,350
no notice about this sort of thing

486
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:12,000
hoping that they'll just go away of

487
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:14,219
course in this case they had they didn't

488
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,680
go away Hutt River province has a really

489
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,150
good website it's chock-full of all

490
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,850
sorts of documents which have been

491
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:25,880
leaked to them by sympathizers here's

492
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:28,770
one from 1976 so six years after they

493
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:32,550
declared independence and it's a

494
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:34,500
restricted cablegram of legal advice to

495
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,050
the Department of Foreign Affairs in

496
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,030
Australia you probably can't read it but

497
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,340
essentially what it's saying is that by

498
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,580
declaring independence these people

499
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:47,550
haven't broken any Australian laws so

500
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,639
they've done nothing illegal so it's

501
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:54,419
still there but they can't get them in

502
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,190
the courts a year later they'd introduce

503
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,790
their own currency and this is a

504
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:03,210
confidential memo to the Australian

505
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:05,610
Cabinet from 1977 again legal advice

506
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,530
saying yeah they've introduced their own

507
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:11,750
currency but again they haven't actually

508
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:14,430
broken any laws so time moves on

509
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:17,490
gradually different government

510
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:19,770
departments take up the case drop it and

511
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:22,470
I bet you can imagine which one was the

512
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:27,060
absolute last one to keep going to the

513
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:30,090
bitter end the tax authorities so every

514
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:34,379
year the Kay's Lee's got sent a tax

515
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:37,679
demand personal tax demand until 2006

516
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:43,350
when William Casey oh sorry Leonard

517
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:45,390
Casey received this letter from the tax

518
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:49,949
authority it's it's his income tax

519
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:51,960
return and I've highlighted the the main

520
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:55,050
bits of it which says additional

521
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,270
information you have been deemed to be a

522
00:26:55,050 --> 00:27:01,470
non-resident of Australia for income tax

523
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:03,389
purposes no tax blah blah blah so he

524
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,690
doesn't live in Australia in which case

525
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:11,070
where does he live Hutt River province

526
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:14,070
a different country and this letter has

527
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,340
been given pride a place on the wall of

528
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,020
the post office in Hutt River province

529
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:22,320
for obvious reasons so they had a piece

530
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,030
of paper that I mean of course they're

531
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,649
not recognized by the Australian

532
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:30,510
government but that piece of paper

533
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:33,060
rather suggests otherwise so hot river

534
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:36,030
province is still going it's nearly 50

535
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,530
years old you can visit it you need to

536
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,889
take your passport of course but they'll

537
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:46,500
stamp it for you and it makes ends meet

538
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:49,320
by selling stamps and sort of

539
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:53,070
presentation packs of their currency and

540
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:55,919
various other knickknacks it also still

541
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:58,679
sells some wheat and some lupins which

542
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:02,850
is a fodder fodder crop and you can also

543
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:05,040
register your company in Hutt River for

544
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,590
a cheaper price than registering it in

545
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,899
Australia and as I say it's nearly 50

546
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:13,770
years old so it's it's been there

547
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:16,290
forever jolly long time now for Hutt

548
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:19,050
River having this piece of paper from

549
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,389
the tax authorities was a real victory

550
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:26,490
but having a piece of paper doesn't

551
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:30,030
always give you a victory I'll detail a

552
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:34,530
much sadder example of Lakota which as

553
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:37,020
you can see is a great big area of

554
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,760
territory slap-bang in the northern

555
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,920
centre of the United States for America

556
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:48,629
and it's the homeland for the Lakota

557
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:54,720
Sioux now the Lakota Sioux had a piece

558
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:59,100
of paper they had a treaty with the US

559
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:02,070
government in 1868 in which it said

560
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,990
quite categorically that this land had

561
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,510
been set apart for the absolute and

562
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:10,520
undisturbed use and occupation of the

563
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,840
Indians herein named the Lakota Sioux

564
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,420
unfortunately for them just a few years

565
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,280
later gold was discovered in the Black

566
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,070
Hills

567
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:22,950
so gold sorry all bets are off

568
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:25,290
however the Lakota Sioux are proud

569
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,740
people the Black Hills are sacred

570
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:30,870
territory to them so they fought it they

571
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,600
fought it on the battlefield and in the

572
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:36,570
court and about a hundred years later

573
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,090
they won and the Indian Claims

574
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,669
Commission ruled that taking the Black

575
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:44,100
Hills was unconstitutional under the

576
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:46,130
Fifth Amendment needless to say the US

577
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:49,139
government appealed and a year later

578
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:52,110
again it was upheld and the court of

579
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:54,920
claims the judge said a more ripe and

580
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,689
ranked case of dishonorable dealings

581
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:01,050
will never in all probability be found

582
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:04,020
in our history they compensated the

583
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:06,540
Sioux that the Lakota Sioux and it was

584
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:09,960
back dated with interest and in in the

585
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:12,770
late 90s it had this this sum of money

586
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,710
had reached half a billion dollars and

587
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:18,950
the Lakota Sioux said no thank you

588
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:21,570
we'll just have our land back please

589
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:26,430
because it's sacred territory and it's

590
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:31,139
not for sale you can imagine what good

591
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:34,970
it did them so in 2007 a group of Lakota

592
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:39,170
Sioux marched on Washington DC and

593
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:41,820
formally withdrew from that treaty and

594
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:44,130
these people they're very proud but

595
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,399
they're also very poor the unemployment

596
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:52,230
rate in the Lakota reservations is

597
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:56,090
something like 60% the literacy rate is

598
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:59,130
also very low it's something like 45%

599
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:01,110
they're dirt poor they could and there

600
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:05,420
aren't many of them so this money would

601
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,419
go a long way but they won't take it

602
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,860
here's a different sort of indigenous

603
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,860
people example this time in Australia

604
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,949
we're back in Australia and this is more

605
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:20,580
recent this is the the more worried

606
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:24,030
people who in 2013 issued this press

607
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:26,760
release Queen recognises Murrah we're a

608
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:29,940
republic Queen being the Queen Elizabeth

609
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,220
of Britain because Australia is part of

610
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,360
the Commonwealth and the absolute head

611
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,640
of status is the

612
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:40,830
queen of england but the more worried

613
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,590
had looked into this and wondered why

614
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,480
was it that this Queen person a long

615
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:49,770
long way away was their head of state

616
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:52,350
and they looked into it and they found

617
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:55,230
out that there are only three ways in

618
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:57,719
which she could be legitimately the head

619
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:00,990
of their state so they wrote her a

620
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,730
letter and they said dear Queen

621
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,940
we understand that you think your head

622
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:09,290
of state of more aware Republic we don't

623
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:11,460
not so sure we'd taken legal advice

624
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:14,428
they're only three ways this could have

625
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:17,790
happened one that we signed a treaty

626
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:20,720
with you know no one remembers there

627
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:25,168
happening to we fought a battle and lost

628
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,990
no can't remember that or three one of

629
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:30,900
your representatives turned up and

630
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:33,030
claimed our land as terra nullius I a

631
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,790
blank canvas somewhere where no one

632
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:39,750
lived and that's ours now thank you very

633
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:42,299
much however the more worried have lived

634
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,520
here for certainly five thousand years

635
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:48,480
and quite possibly ten thousand years

636
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:50,910
there's a famous fish trap that's been

637
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,590
dated by archaeologists as between five

638
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:56,250
and ten thousand years old so these

639
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:57,389
people have been there a long time so in

640
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,070
their letter they said to the Queen

641
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,320
look these these are the arguments

642
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:03,899
perhaps you know better perhaps you'll

643
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,110
let us know but if we know you're busy

644
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,970
lady if you don't respond within a month

645
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:12,719
then we'll just take it as read that you

646
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:15,410
do recognize us and hence this press

647
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,650
release from the Murray worried Republic

648
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:22,520
and that case has actually spawned a

649
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:28,200
series of very similar claims by other

650
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:29,370
Aborigine tribes in Australia let's come

651
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,270
a bit closer to home

652
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:36,000
here's them an island which is an

653
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,500
anomaly in my country as I say my

654
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,460
country I'm not sure if it is my country

655
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,230
it's called the Isle of Man and it's a

656
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:46,830
self-governing dependency of the British

657
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:49,890
crown it's a very small island or

658
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:53,928
midway between Scotland Wales England

659
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:56,850
and Ireland and Northern Ireland and

660
00:33:53,929 --> 00:34:00,000
it's not part of the United Kingdom nor

661
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:03,539
is it part of the European Union it sets

662
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,539
his own taxes decides what people learn

663
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:09,509
in school so on and so forth it has the

664
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:12,570
oldest continuous continuously operating

665
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:15,599
parliament anywhere it date it's called

666
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:18,119
the tin wold and it dates from the 8th

667
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,679
century the Vikings set it up and it's

668
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:27,119
still going so the only connection with

669
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,190
the UK is that they use pounds

670
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,879
they have passports which look very like

671
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,320
ours but interestingly it says it's a

672
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,969
European Union Passport

673
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,159
but they're not part of the European

674
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:43,020
Union and as an autonomous or

675
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:47,040
semi-autonomous or however however you

676
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:49,710
want to put it island it has some rather

677
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,050
impressive credentials for democracy in

678
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,899
1881

679
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:57,540
they gave the folk the first vote to

680
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:59,279
women in Parliament admittedly at that

681
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,060
stage it was only women who had property

682
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,820
but nonetheless it was the first and in

683
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:11,240
2006 it was the first nation in Western

684
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,240
Europe to lower the voting age to 16

685
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:21,480
let's have a look at my art which is an

686
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:24,089
odd one now we talk about opting out but

687
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,760
my art decided that didn't want to opt

688
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:28,320
out it's a it's a complicated story but

689
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,500
I'll take you through it the Comoros

690
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,710
were part of France for a hundred fifty

691
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,109
odd years 1970s they started talking

692
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:40,290
about independence the French set up a

693
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:43,230
referendum and a lot of people turned

694
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:45,390
out and it was a resounding vote in

695
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:49,680
favor of independence yes please

696
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:51,930
nearly 95% of people kamorin people

697
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,299
voted that they'd like independence from

698
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,589
France thank you very much except

699
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,220
unfortunately it wasn't quite so

700
00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:00,259
clear-cut if you look at the geography

701
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,980
of the place

702
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:11,690
now there are four islands rohnke more

703
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:20,250
99.98% yes mo le 99.9 2% years

704
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:23,310
Anwar 99.9 3% yes err and my yacht Oh No

705
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,980
thank you very much we won't be

706
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:30,210
partaking of Independence we'd like to

707
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:34,710
stay in France and no one expected this

708
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:36,750
I don't think the chemours went ahead

709
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,210
and declared independence for all four

710
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:41,940
Islands there was an uproar there was a

711
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,130
period of a decade or more every year of

712
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,530
the General Assembly in September the

713
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,840
kamorin president said stood up and said

714
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,600
we want our island back France cause

715
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,000
being a member of the Security Council

716
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,890
vetoed any attempt to give it back so on

717
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,040
and so forth

718
00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:00,480
meanwhile Ma'at this one island that

719
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,570
decided it didn't want to be part of

720
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,700
France was slowly climbing its way up

721
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:10,890
the hierarchy of territorial categories

722
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,689
until it became an overseas department

723
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:18,000
which means it elects a member of

724
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:23,790
parliament and then in 2014 it became

725
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,680
part of the European Union so I don't

726
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:29,670
think it's going back to the chemours

727
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:36,720
anytime soon so that's a different sort

728
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:38,430
of opting out um I'm nearly finishing up

729
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,700
now but I just want to finish up with

730
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:46,230
two different sorts of examples one is

731
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:49,080
antarctica which is a big continent that

732
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,820
is governed in a different way or isn't

733
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,790
government governed I don't know that

734
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,680
there was this treaty in 1959 where all

735
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,170
of the countries that are claimed part

736
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,169
of the Antarctica and there were half a

737
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:03,510
dozen plus that there's still an

738
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:05,850
unclaimed section there but all of these

739
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,650
countries who had claimed part of the

740
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,870
territory it has no indigenous

741
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,970
population at all so they all of these

742
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,390
countries put their claims for

743
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:17,799
sovereignty acai

744
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:20,470
in 1959 and this was declared it was a

745
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,690
special continent it's different

746
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:27,370
there should be no prospecting for

747
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:30,100
minerals there should be only tourism

748
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:32,650
and science and therefore it's governed

749
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:35,020
in a unique and different way it's a

750
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,170
model that perhaps others could look at

751
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:41,350
because no one country rules its

752
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:43,630
territory it even has its own internet

753
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:46,990
country code although I'm assured that

754
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:50,080
that none of those websites ending in a

755
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:54,000
QR in Antarctica they're all in South

756
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,500
America however although there's this

757
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,830
Antarctic Treaty which treats it in a

758
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:03,190
uniquely different way nonetheless all

759
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:06,490
of the countries that did lay claim

760
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:09,190
still sort of have influence on their

761
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:12,009
segments of territory so they issue

762
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:16,120
stamps they have so there's the UK

763
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:20,290
there's Argentina as Chile New Zealand

764
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:22,350
Australia Norway so they issue stamps

765
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:26,050
the UK even issued a special

766
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:27,850
commemorative coin for use only at the

767
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,700
British Antarctic Survey base in

768
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:33,069
Antarctica but you know they're supposed

769
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,439
to have put these claims to sovereignty

770
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:38,800
to one side so it's all a bit naughty

771
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,620
and you can imagine that if ever the

772
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,900
Antarctic Treaty stops for some reason

773
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:45,970
these countries will be head of the

774
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,160
queue saying oh yeah well actually yeah

775
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:52,120
yeah we've been governing it for a long

776
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:54,759
time so it's different but only up to a

777
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,859
point and then the last example I want

778
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,900
to show you is this place alga Landvik

779
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:02,710
Vohland which you've all been to

780
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:07,660
knowingly or unknowingly it was created

781
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:09,610
by two Swedish artists in the 1990s and

782
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,040
they fancied setting up their own

783
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:14,920
country but they hadn't got an army so

784
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,350
what were they to do they decided that

785
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,270
they'd crossed several borders I don't

786
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,670
you probably cross borders yourself and

787
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:24,790
seen these segments of no-man's land you

788
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:27,320
go from one post through 50 metres 100

789
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,330
metres perhaps more and then to the next

790
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,180
border post at the next country who owns

791
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:36,110
this bit then answer alkyl and fergal

792
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:40,069
and they claimed all these bits between

793
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:43,300
other nations as well as all digital

794
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:47,090
territory and other states of existence

795
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:49,280
so if you've dropped off during this

796
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:51,490
talk or any other talk you've had a

797
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,710
little side trip to earth or our land

798
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:57,430
and you could therefore apply for a

799
00:40:54,710 --> 00:41:00,290
passport they issue their own passports

800
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:02,330
interestingly enough ten years after the

801
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:05,509
creation of L gland Bergland about a

802
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:08,840
hundred passport holders decided to go

803
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:11,660
from stockholm across to tallinn in

804
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:14,930
estonia only on their algal and vulgar

805
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:18,109
and passports and the idea was that they

806
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:20,120
get to Tallinn be refused entry sent

807
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,860
back to Stockholm be refused entry

808
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,870
because no one would recognize this

809
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:26,900
possible and therefore they'd be forever

810
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:27,819
in algal and Berglund the space in

811
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,260
between

812
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:32,210
unfortunately the the the joke was on

813
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,800
them because when they got to tellen

814
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:37,070
they were all arrested and their

815
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:40,160
passports were confiscated and then they

816
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:43,210
sent them back to Stockholm but

817
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:46,120
nonetheless it's it's another idea for

818
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:49,160
organizing territory or non territory

819
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,990
also that you might like to ponder on

820
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:55,310
and I'm gonna finish that that I'll

821
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:58,009
leave you with some flags of other non

822
00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:00,500
countries that appear in the book which

823
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:02,810
I haven't had time to talk about and to

824
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,480
tell you that if this is your sort of

825
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:08,000
thing then the book is also available in

826
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,800
Czech and they're selling it outside

827
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,800
thank you very much for listening

828
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:25,209
thank you very much Nick and before the

829
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:26,799
big show with golden auction starts we

830
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,868
still have some time for some questions

831
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:32,579
so please rise your hand we would like

832
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:34,959
to ask thank you very much for your

833
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:37,689
presentation a short question do you

834
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:39,819
know the country liebe lund label and

835
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:41,618
yes I do yes what do is one of the first

836
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:43,089
ones pointed out to me I'm sorry I

837
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:45,029
didn't mention it what do you think

838
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:48,009
about it is it a country is it a nation

839
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:51,009
what do you think where can it go well

840
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:52,299
in a sense it is in that territory I

841
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:53,769
don't know if it has a permanent

842
00:42:52,299 --> 00:42:59,499
population it's only a small island

843
00:42:53,769 --> 00:43:00,698
isn't it and Croatia and Serbia yes I

844
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:04,328
thought it was an island in a river

845
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:06,699
between those two countries is it so

846
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:08,769
it's an island in a river between those

847
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:11,380
two countries I don't so it has a

848
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:12,908
territory which has been claimed no

849
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:16,029
doubt as a government I don't know if it

850
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:17,619
has a permanent population this

851
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:20,739
gentleman shaking his head so perhaps

852
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:22,869
not and so it's on the borders but as

853
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:24,519
I've said there are no hard and fast

854
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:28,749
rules about countries there's no

855
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:30,459
Universal definition and therefore there

856
00:43:28,749 --> 00:43:32,828
it is and good luck to it and some of

857
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:34,359
these non countries have been around for

858
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:40,119
a very long time as I say like Hutt

859
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:42,880
River gentlemen in the first thanks for

860
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:45,189
the talk I miss you I wanted to ask you

861
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,069
if you went to some of these places and

862
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:50,519
in that case what was your favorite aha

863
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:53,439
yes yes I have been to some not all

864
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:56,258
I've been to a handful actually and I

865
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:59,009
think my favorite is Greenland because

866
00:43:56,259 --> 00:44:03,130
it's fantastically beautiful and vast

867
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:06,489
and of all the 50 in this book if I had

868
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:08,289
to bet on one becoming an established UN

869
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:11,349
member state I'd bet on Greenland

870
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:13,869
because they've in the last 3040 years

871
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:16,449
they've they've had taken steps towards

872
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:19,299
complete autonomy they they get some

873
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:22,719
they still get a subsidy from Denmark

874
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:27,350
but some people say that the I think

875
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:31,250
it's the 300th anniversary of the Danes

876
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:33,440
arriving which is in 2021 could be an

877
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:36,140
auspicious date for independence we

878
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,110
shall see it depends a lot on the oil

879
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:41,600
price though they are not available for

880
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:44,690
sale right I completely right yeah

881
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:55,190
absolutely right it's a matter of

882
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:57,950
questions please I have a question what

883
00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:02,510
about little Java sorry ii know java

884
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:05,990
raja ro j ova it's a kurdish line

885
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:08,360
between North Syria and and true ki and

886
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,160
5 million people if they're they have no

887
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,680
government is it completely

888
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,980
decentralized land and last last year we

889
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:18,109
had one guy he had two years ago here

890
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,120
the presentation girl Java so is it

891
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:22,670
considered to be like a like a country

892
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:26,060
now like it's independent country it's

893
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:28,790
between like a North Sea Syria and and

894
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:31,910
and Turkey well I mean at that part of

895
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:34,060
the world has also had quite a lot of

896
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:37,009
unpleasantness in recent times hasn't it

897
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:38,360
Isis which also tried to create their

898
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:41,210
own country yeah

899
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,280
there are fighters of against Isis the

900
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:45,760
biggest one there you are and it's also

901
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,250
interestingly enough on the territory of

902
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,160
what was self declared as Kurdistan in

903
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:56,380
the 1930s so it's a part of the world

904
00:45:52,160 --> 00:46:00,350
which has attempted to break free of its

905
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:02,180
host nations several times and all I can

906
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:04,880
say again is only time will tell whether

907
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:11,180
it turns into a fully fledged recognized

908
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:13,220
country or not thank you for I would

909
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:16,730
like to ask you what about autonomy so

910
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:18,830
how to achieve autonomy inside inside

911
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,360
the state sorry could could you ask the

912
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:24,259
question again I didn't know how to

913
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:27,410
achieve autonomy in inside the state how

914
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:30,260
do you achieve autonomy it's a political

915
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:33,020
process needless to say by negotiation

916
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:37,760
in many cases it's by historical

917
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:40,790
precedent and to a large degree it will

918
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,180
depend your your your relative success I

919
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,099
think

920
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:47,180
or history tells us your relative

921
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:49,900
success will depend on what you have so

922
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:53,930
if you look at somewhere like others or

923
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:56,900
Khuzestan in southwestern Iran it's an

924
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:58,788
Arabic speaking segment of Iran where

925
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:01,970
all the rest speak Farsi and they're all

926
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:03,740
Persians and it was more or less

927
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:05,720
independent for quite a long time until

928
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,899
the Persians decided they were going to

929
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,359
have it how did they decide because it's

930
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,160
full of oil and it's the most oil

931
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,930
productive part of Iran

932
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,270
so although they'd love to be autonomous

933
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:20,270
it's not gonna happen or anything not

934
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:22,759
within my lifetime so it's a political

935
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:25,538
process by negotiation but as I said

936
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,380
about Greenland you can have success

937
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:31,760
Greenland have quite a degree of

938
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:35,890
autonomy gentlemen thanks for the talk

939
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:39,109
so in your framework one criterion was

940
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:42,259
claim to territory maybe expand on why

941
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:45,680
and also if you could offer your outlook

942
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:47,480
for nation-states being established in

943
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,940
the future that do not there are non

944
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,599
territorial there are some non

945
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:56,630
territorial ones a meat for example

946
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:59,420
Atlantean is one now it's non

947
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:04,640
territorial but it has a territorial

948
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:06,289
base you know let's face it I'd like to

949
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,819
be non territorial but I can't

950
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:12,770
oh yeah briefly very briefly you know

951
00:48:10,819 --> 00:48:15,440
you have to don't you but yeah there are

952
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:17,599
places that that claim el as does algal

953
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:21,130
and Vogel and it it claim digital

954
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:25,579
territory so there are alternatives and

955
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:28,039
as we know with people talking about who

956
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:30,589
owns outer space you know these things

957
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:33,230
are up for grabs and they're up for

958
00:48:30,589 --> 00:48:35,750
negotiation and like anywhere else it

959
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:37,369
will be either an issue of negotiation

960
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,609
or brute force and power

961
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:42,680
what about salvaging a nation-state

962
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:46,308
based on renting land from another

963
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:48,470
nation let's say for a thousand years I

964
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:52,940
don't think that's happened to my

965
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:54,870
knowledge you could yeah I mean

966
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,460
technically of course it's possible

967
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:58,200
you could you'd always be open to

968
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,930
arguments to say that actually you're

969
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,430
not autonomous you're just renting

970
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:06,359
actually an example of that is

971
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:08,640
Kristiania or in copenhagen because they

972
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,850
they they occupied this it was a

973
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,759
military area in central Copenhagen

974
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:19,890
it was just occupied by hippies long

975
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:22,230
time ago can't remember when yeah yeah

976
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,790
they they now have to pay rent but

977
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:25,230
recently and I don't know if the

978
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:27,840
deadlines arrived but recently the

979
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:31,050
government offered to sell them the

980
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,670
territory I don't know if that's come

981
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:34,500
about but it was the ultimate paradox

982
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:38,610
because these people were hippies they

983
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:40,650
weren't into ownership so you want to

984
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:49,620
buy your future or not here is a

985
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:51,750
question from gentlemen in second row is

986
00:49:49,620 --> 00:50:01,140
their land unclaimed yes

987
00:49:51,750 --> 00:50:04,530
Antarctica sorry I didn't understand

988
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:08,940
that bit there were there's a part of

989
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:13,830
Antarctica a big wedge that hasn't been

990
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:17,700
claimed stopped there we go here we go

991
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:24,590
this bit that bit of Antarctica has not

992
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:24,589
been claimed by anyone so get down there

993
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:31,470
hello this was amazing I'm wondering for

994
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:33,570
those who don't countries that have a

995
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:35,609
substantial population how do they

996
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,620
integrate with the rest of the world I

997
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:39,510
mean how do they do banking or how do

998
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,980
they integrate with communication

999
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:43,050
networks do they have a pattern state

1000
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:45,300
let's say that where they are attached

1001
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:47,460
like Northern Cyprus or how does this

1002
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,620
work I mean hard even if they are not

1003
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:51,960
recognized somehow they have to yeah

1004
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,060
with difficulties sometimes as you say

1005
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,040
they have a patron saint this pain

1006
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,990
trance state many have one that

1007
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,779
recognized them like Northern Cyprus

1008
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:03,899
like those bits of the Soviet Union are

1009
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:05,930
recognized by Russia but in other cases

1010
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,170
they have to do it piecemeal so

1011
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,089
Somaliland

1012
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:11,400
you they issue their

1013
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:14,240
passports they're not recognized by any

1014
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,950
other nation state but they do have

1015
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:21,299
arrangements for recognition of their

1016
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:24,240
passports with a number of African

1017
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:26,310
countries so South Africa is one so if

1018
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,779
you're a smaller lender and you want to

1019
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:30,480
go to South Africa on your passport

1020
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:32,730
issued by the Somaliland government it

1021
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,800
is recognized in South Africa but it's

1022
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,750
not recognized in Namibia and many other

1023
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,870
African countries so they've they've

1024
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:42,320
managed to reach bilateral agreements

1025
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:44,730
but it's very difficult and there's

1026
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:49,260
constantly a fuss with in Somali and

1027
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:52,320
case because Somalia is is gradually

1028
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:54,450
getting back on its feet and recently

1029
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:57,960
for example control of Somali lands

1030
00:51:54,450 --> 00:52:00,509
airspace which had been governed from I

1031
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:04,290
think Kenya for the last several decades

1032
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:06,390
was handed back to Mogadishu and there

1033
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:08,640
was an uproar in Somaliland because they

1034
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:10,589
said well what about us but you know we

1035
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,460
control our we should control our space

1036
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:16,230
so it's very difficult very difficult

1037
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:21,480
thank you and very last question before

1038
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:28,920
the big show starts the bounds of the

1039
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:32,370
island of mana you can pay you can pay

1040
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:37,440
with the bounce in London for example is

1041
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:39,990
it one he's one to one yes if if you try

1042
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,790
and buy a packet of cigarettes with our

1043
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:47,490
Isle of Man cash money in a small shop

1044
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:50,130
they'll probably refused to take it but

1045
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:52,620
it is legal tender in the UK so yes they

1046
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:54,210
should take it but this the same happens

1047
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,220
with Scottish pound notes they issue

1048
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:58,560
their own pound notes the Bank of

1049
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:01,169
Scotland and sometimes you can spend

1050
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:03,150
them in a big supermarket and sometimes

1051
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:08,520
you can't they say oh no we can't take

1052
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:12,150
those in Prak I saw many exchanges have

1053
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,190
different rates for for Scottish and

1054
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,670
English bar do they do they oh that's

1055
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:17,940
interesting

1056
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:19,680
yes yeah well if they accepted Isle of

1057
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:23,220
Man pounds they'd probably have a

1058
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:26,460
another rate again

1059
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:28,558
lower right but but I mean it should be

1060
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:31,859
parity it should be one-to-one it is

1061
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:41,549
officially one-to-one so thank you very

1062
