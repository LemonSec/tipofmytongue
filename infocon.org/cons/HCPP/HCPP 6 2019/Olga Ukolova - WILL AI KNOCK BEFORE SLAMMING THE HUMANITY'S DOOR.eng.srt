1
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,848
so welcome everyone welcome to police

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,820
and prac again it's so awesome to see a

3
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:37,250
lot of familiar faces but also a lot of

4
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,879
new faces coming every year this is the

5
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:43,579
sixth year of hackers Congress and I'm

6
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:46,820
lucky because I get to open one of the

7
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:48,920
first talks and but before I get into

8
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,470
like actually introducing the speaker

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,970
and doing all the formalities let me

10
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:58,820
just play with all these pockets yes do

11
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,949
the magic because just it's you know

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,350
life is full of coincidences and just

13
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,869
like a couple of days ago I got this

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:09,560
message on whatsapp from a person that I

15
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:10,820
know he's a lawyer and he lectures and I

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,440
want to read it to you because it's

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,869
totally in the context of what we're

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,600
going to listen to for the next 40

19
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:20,330
minutes and this person is lecturing as

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,690
a part-time professor at the Beijing

21
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:27,110
University and he messaged me that he's

22
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,539
trying to do develop mutual licensing

23
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,940
standards for privacy protection

24
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:36,020
services to build a common Eurasian

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:38,869
cyberspace and of course he does you who

26
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,789
know me can anticipate my reaction I was

27
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,280
like it's awesome that you're working in

28
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:45,380
the privacy sphere I'm supportive of

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,410
that but don't you think that any kind

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:51,289
of licensing potentially opens a

31
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,598
backdoor or that the licensing will even

32
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:56,690
require a backdoor for the government

33
00:01:53,599 --> 00:02:00,050
especially in China and his response

34
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:02,239
really struck me so there was he said

35
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,819
you're dreaming if you think you could

36
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,920
ever avoid that my approach is to create

37
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:09,199
transparency of standards and to bind

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,290
with practices to them and the more

39
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,709
sovereigns subscribe to it the stronger

40
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:18,470
they can defend privacy well and so

41
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:23,360
there are two streams of thought right

42
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:25,730
we want to legitimize AI and standardize

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,980
and provide legal framework and then

44
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:32,420
there's the second approach that Olga

45
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:36,649
stands for because she is one of the

46
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,000
authors of open AI manifesto No yeah

47
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,530
free I I'm sorry

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,890
free AI because opening I

49
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,350
is one of one of Ellen masks University

50
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:51,769
actually stands for like fluffy Pony

51
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:57,230
typed of AI please give a warm warm

52
00:02:51,770 --> 00:03:01,250
welcome by the way

53
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:04,010
oh yeah Oklahoma is also a doctor so she

54
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,319
will be the one drilling the the hole

55
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,810
into my brain when I want my newer link

56
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,269
right well I will build a machine that

57
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,980
would do that better than I feel much

58
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,640
better than a woman's going to do that

59
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:21,410
with her sensitive approach but please

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:26,089
take the stage Thanks hi guys so thanks

61
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:31,760
Elena for a perfect introduction my talk

62
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:34,310
would be at some point not a monologue I

63
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,590
don't want to do that I actually want to

64
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,819
start the discussion there for the talk

65
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,090
I will try to make the talk as fast as I

66
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,230
can

67
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:49,970
and then I would actually want to have

68
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:52,220
conversation with you so the name of the

69
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,019
talk is non-aggression principle not be

70
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,180
sleeping nap with non-aggression

71
00:03:54,019 --> 00:04:02,450
principle for artificial agents and I

72
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:05,690
think we can start with that I'll have

73
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:12,589
three chapters as far as I remember the

74
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:14,390
first one is about communication why

75
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,750
communication why do I start with this

76
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,870
because non-aggression principle itself

77
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,630
is the principle of communication and

78
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:28,460
interaction amongst several different

79
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:30,380
agents communication is from leading the

80
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,890
successful conveying of any information

81
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:36,020
from one agent or group of agents to

82
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:41,240
another through different mediums

83
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:44,479
I want to stress at word agent here our

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,169
group of agents because there are

85
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,200
different types of agents not just human

86
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,450
to human that do communicate which are

87
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,430
with each other

88
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:59,620
and the types are biological it means

89
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,570
when tooth cells meet they somehow

90
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,120
interact with each other they exchange

91
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,630
supplements and then this is actually

92
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,750
communication human communication which

93
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:14,140
is mostly language language the computer

94
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,470
network one and also two of my favorite

95
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,280
ones

96
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:21,580
the first is economic economical one

97
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,669
which is basically trade because when we

98
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,680
trade something with someone it actually

99
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,500
is a communication whether it's verbally

100
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,640
whether it's going verbally or

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,440
non-verbally

102
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,690
and my favorite went probably the first

103
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,030
communication which is usually either a

104
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,490
competition or a war and it's usually

105
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:47,859
from game theory perspective happen is

106
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:50,500
happening with zero-sum games what

107
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,780
properties usually communication

108
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,580
protocols have they have the common

109
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:59,859
context they have the understandable

110
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,550
understandable language meta language

111
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:07,300
which is also very important error

112
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,950
checks privacy and proofs of the

113
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,360
information of the validity of the

114
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:16,030
information common context for humans is

115
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,230
actually culture environment that they

116
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:22,690
were born or they interact in language

117
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:26,350
is something that everyone knows that we

118
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:29,020
use we use words we combine symbols in

119
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,840
we compose messages via combining

120
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:37,979
symbols also we use meta language which

121
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:41,590
is kind of I would say is gestures and

122
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:44,350
outfits and all those details that you

123
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:49,919
can not grasp but you understand the

124
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:53,700
information from that error checks is

125
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,950
basically something that we always do

126
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,140
when we hear new information we try to

127
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,849
find the source of it we try to verify

128
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:04,150
whether the information is true or not

129
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,800
whether someone is lying to us and this

130
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:10,628
is how the redundant

131
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:16,389
is going on and the privacy the privacy

132
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:22,360
in our human communication is probably

133
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:26,740
not that it's very common for us but

134
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,569
again it's very complex because when two

135
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,639
people from the same environment meet

136
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:33,720
they can use their own language that

137
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,759
will never be understood by any other

138
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,280
group of people or other humans that do

139
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:43,440
not understand the meanings of the words

140
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:48,250
that we use so in human communication

141
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:51,159
every every person needs to store the

142
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,110
information about the culture needs to

143
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,000
be able to compose and encode the

144
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:59,259
information in order to pass it without

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,180
losing any kind of meaning and to

146
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:04,719
receive be able to receive the

147
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,419
information and of course to interpret

148
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:12,639
it correctly and to be able to act on

149
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:15,400
the received information this that was

150
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,120
one approach you haven't noticed

151
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:21,159
something wrong with the slides right

152
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,479
the second chapter would be about

153
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:32,849
different approach to communication

154
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:36,789
there was in I think early 90s the a

155
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:38,649
great work by Shannon which is called

156
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:43,500
mathematical theory of communications

157
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:47,800
and here are several quotes from that

158
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,140
the my favorite here is that the actual

159
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,589
message is the one selected from a set

160
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:58,980
of possible messages and Shannon has a

161
00:08:53,589 --> 00:09:03,130
lot of scientists they skipped this the

162
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,920
term I would say meaning of the message

163
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:11,320
because it was just irrelevant for him

164
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:13,719
as an engineer and as a scientist this

165
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,810
is a code by probably my favorite man

166
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,240
ever

167
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,520
if each man had a definite set of rules

168
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,560
of conduct by which he regulated his

169
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:28,079
life he would be no better than a

170
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:30,810
machine so basically it says that if we

171
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,210
would be able to predict any

172
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,779
communication and any interaction we

173
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,690
would not be different from computers

174
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:43,589
this is the logical question that arises

175
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:48,390
after the quote and we are very tempted

176
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:53,779
to say no we're not machines but are we

177
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:57,480
sure about that for example there is in

178
00:09:53,779 --> 00:10:01,050
war fighting in military there is a

179
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,839
thing which was invented by john-boy in

180
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:10,020
1952 which is called the OODA loop it's

181
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:15,839
basically how the Marine operates in a

182
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:19,170
very unstable environment it composes of

183
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,510
several steps which are one which never

184
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,829
actually differentiate from one

185
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,780
situation to another he every marine

186
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:30,360
getting into this situation observes

187
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,589
what's happening oriented in what's

188
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,990
happening makes decision based on the

189
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,620
different kinds of alternative

190
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,200
information different kinds of

191
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,920
alternative paths and actually acts upon

192
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,870
the information information and upon the

193
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:54,949
results of observation that he had also

194
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:58,530
a great I think he was an anatomist

195
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:01,470
doctor medical doctor he had a theory of

196
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:06,510
functional systems and as far as you can

197
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:09,839
see we have the exact same pattern if we

198
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:12,660
talk about simple behavior patterns of

199
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:17,100
any kind of mammal any kind of animal

200
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:21,329
any kind of human it says that getting

201
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:24,089
into some if we take a rabbit for

202
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:28,020
example getting into some box with

203
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:29,370
different stimulus stimulus at first his

204
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,860
reaction would be too

205
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,110
observe what's happening with him what's

206
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,770
happening around what has changed the

207
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:41,760
second step would be to make a decision

208
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:44,579
based on the changes then to make up the

209
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:50,150
mind of what to do how to react on the

210
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:54,300
stimuli and eventually to act so again

211
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:58,680
if we can predict if we can use one

212
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:01,380
simple algorithm for almost all kinds of

213
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,989
situations that animals can be in or

214
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:08,310
humans can be in are we really different

215
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:12,300
from what we have in machines now this

216
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:15,619
question leads us to this feeling I

217
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,000
think because if you come over to any

218
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:22,050
simple person and you start describing

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,410
that everyone starting from mammals to

220
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:29,760
your wonderful son for example everyone

221
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:34,279
uses the same patterns then and probably

222
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:38,819
you would frighten the person and also

223
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:40,860
if you if you say that there is another

224
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,640
type of agent which is now nowadays

225
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,310
called AI which might not use the same

226
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:53,270
patterns probably you would freak the

227
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:59,839
hell out of the person for me probably

228
00:12:53,270 --> 00:13:03,569
the most the scariest thing of the AI

229
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,070
agent is the intelligence because I've

230
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,320
been asking a lot of people what a

231
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:10,350
telogen s-- is how they define it and

232
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:16,380
I've never ever received the answer that

233
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:18,900
would suit me the first question was

234
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,450
introduced by Alan Turing which was can

235
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:25,800
machine things can machine think in the

236
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:28,440
imitation game in his paper and after

237
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,410
that a lot of people gained the fear of

238
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,500
some super intelligence agent coming

239
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:38,370
over and grabbing everyone and throwing

240
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:42,270
them into the kettle probably so my

241
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,050
friends and we at the free I manifested

242
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,389
Club

243
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:48,579
invented not invented but we started the

244
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:51,699
discussion what intelligence is and I

245
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:54,459
want to introduce two thoughts on that

246
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:54,849
and I would appreciate your feedback on

247
00:13:54,459 --> 00:14:01,388
that

248
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:03,579
so the first first thought was that the

249
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:06,519
intelligence is the ability to correctly

250
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:10,138
calculate complex multi-step strategies

251
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:14,560
in multi-agent environment for example

252
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:18,040
we can take a crop a bird it can

253
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,529
actually calculate seven steps ahead

254
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:25,689
from the place where he where it is now

255
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:28,120
and to act on those strategy but does it

256
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:31,779
make it more intelligence than more

257
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:34,839
intelligent than us and the second

258
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:36,600
parameter is an ability to create

259
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:41,649
different abstraction levels and

260
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:45,279
successfully operate on them but I think

261
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:47,589
everyone had some friend or know some

262
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,889
macademia guy who is perfect in

263
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:53,350
mathematics or physics but he can never

264
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:56,800
build a business he can never even find

265
00:14:53,350 --> 00:15:02,230
his glasses but does it make him stupid

266
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,779
or unintelligent this is something that

267
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:09,519
I like more this is the second thought

268
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:12,130
that we had so we divided intelligence

269
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,959
into two parts the first is related to

270
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:21,220
goal setting basically it's the ability

271
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:24,339
to have to evolution to become something

272
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:28,449
more complex than just Homo sapiens

273
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:30,519
you can use the Maslow's pyramid here on

274
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:33,329
the basic level you would see the

275
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,920
animalistic patterns that we can use

276
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:38,949
that people have is reproduction

277
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,779
survival etc the second level would be

278
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:42,969
something that people use in order to

279
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:48,279
communicate communicate within the

280
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:50,980
species level and the cap of the

281
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:54,730
triangle is the thirst for becoming more

282
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,300
and more complex the advancement on the

283
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,330
goal-setting scale is

284
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,510
actually the ability to desire something

285
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:06,770
that is commonly thought to be

286
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:09,200
impossible and to actually capture this

287
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:12,439
impossible thing with your intelligence

288
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,810
and to act upon it and turn it into

289
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,740
something which is fundamentally

290
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,780
achievable with almost no efforts and

291
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,930
the second part of that is goal reaching

292
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:27,910
is the ability to achieve results at the

293
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:35,349
top of your of the pyramid of this

294
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:38,750
without ignoring the basic parts and the

295
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:42,310
subtypes or abilities that are included

296
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:44,950
in the second thought are these ones our

297
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:48,800
communication establishing contact

298
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,750
self-discipline ability to take risks to

299
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,040
analyze and summarize information and

300
00:16:50,750 --> 00:17:01,190
this is the sub type of the intelligence

301
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:03,560
of our second thought why still working

302
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:06,980
on the basic levels are is important

303
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:10,609
because for example viruses are very

304
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,410
primitive but still we we as human

305
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,839
species still haven't managed to fight

306
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:18,530
them we're still dying from all that but

307
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:25,929
this doesn't make viruses intelligent of

308
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:30,980
some sort the humanistic level I would

309
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:34,430
see simple 9 to 5 workers on that level

310
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,200
because they actually do huge work in

311
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,880
order to communicate with each other in

312
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,400
order to build something on that level

313
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,680
but they never they they are pretty

314
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,130
intelligent a pretty skilled but again

315
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:52,940
they are not as intelligent as viruses

316
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:55,700
and they never want to opt out and I

317
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,800
think you also know some people from

318
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,330
your environment that can be called pipe

319
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,680
dreamers those are people that always

320
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,260
theorizing about everything there ever

321
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,990
can be and they never actually do

322
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,620
something worth 'full they ignore the

323
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,260
animalist

324
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,820
level or their life and they ignore any

325
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,400
kind of interaction peer-to-peer

326
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,409
interaction or me would use a medium

327
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:25,550
interaction with other peers in the

328
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:30,740
species chain this leads us again to the

329
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:33,409
fear because if we actually build or if

330
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,360
there appears something which would have

331
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,030
all those abilities which would be

332
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,659
actually super intelligent regarding

333
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:44,899
what we are now then we cannot attribute

334
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:47,179
we cannot attribute the act we cannot

335
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:51,020
attribute the information and we are

336
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:52,550
will be paralyzed in order to paralyze

337
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,090
in our acting in our decision-making

338
00:18:52,550 --> 00:19:00,409
process because basically these two

339
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:05,300
parts of the pattern that we as animals

340
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:08,480
use would be lost but do cats recognize

341
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,590
how milk appears in the fridge do they

342
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,800
freak out because of that

343
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:17,750
no they just don't understand humans are

344
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:22,550
just separate things that live next to

345
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:25,910
them and the second question do monkeys

346
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:28,480
judge us is something more intelligent

347
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:34,870
according to their moral principles

348
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:37,820
according to their code of ethics no

349
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:41,899
non-aggression principle is an approach

350
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:46,220
for communication there are different

351
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:48,200
kinds of different kinds of approaches

352
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:53,600
to define what non-aggression principle

353
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:55,790
is and this is my favorite this is the

354
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,559
favorite one that I received from one of

355
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:05,570
my friends it's a principle to ask first

356
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:08,139
and shoot later for me probably at some

357
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:12,200
point the non-aggression principle and

358
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:16,700
every almost every type of restriction

359
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,170
that we we built or we use in in order

360
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,440
to communicate with each other or

361
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:23,090
exchange goods it's something which I

362
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,129
call censorship

363
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:30,529
some point and I'm very very not sure

364
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:34,998
whether ni P can become in you AI

365
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:36,499
regulation because now we have GDP RS we

366
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:39,850
have bands for autonomous weapon

367
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:42,590
research we have everything banned

368
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:45,080
according to some moral or ethical

369
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:51,709
principles that we don't even actually

370
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:54,439
share I have a very definition what we

371
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,629
have today and what we'll have in the

372
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,369
evening because it's not even happening

373
00:20:56,629 --> 00:21:02,389
tomorrow it's already happening but

374
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:05,809
probably if bit too quiet all Dai

375
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:09,019
regulations are now banning the

376
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:12,590
development of the technology based on

377
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:15,070
some climate change gender equality they

378
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:20,090
scream that AI as a technology should

379
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:25,928
serve us humans in order to receive some

380
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:32,990
ethics and moral improvements and to

381
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:36,409
help us actually fight the inequality at

382
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:41,149
manifesto that AI we use different

383
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:43,460
approach we have some principles that we

384
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:47,809
follow we have principles that we are

385
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:51,139
here to discuss but we never try to

386
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:57,408
force anyone to follow them until they

387
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:59,658
share it so basically if you want to

388
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:03,470
question what's happening if you want to

389
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:05,509
question the basic levels of the society

390
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:08,330
and if you want to question why

391
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:12,799
something is happening and why how can

392
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:17,119
you contribute to it please ask me

393
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:20,059
questions try to opt out of the mental

394
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:23,480
system that you have in your brain ask

395
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:26,330
questions to yourself ask why you're

396
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,519
doing something why something is bent it

397
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:32,090
regarding the AI technology and not even

398
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,000
that only after breaking those cages

399
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,418
your mental cages you can actually build

400
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,299
something you and actually all

401
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,299
out of other systems Thanks

402
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:53,759
if you yeah one one one thing there's my

403
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:56,549
email so if you have some questions now

404
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,679
you can ask them if you will have some

405
00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:00,658
questions drop me an email and I will

406
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,269
add you to the group of people that has

407
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,009
been actually discussing all that thank

408
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:07,590
you very much Olga it was great

409
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:09,539
I do have questions before you ask yours

410
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:13,369
please make sure you actually hold the

411
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:16,350
mic so your questions are also recorded

412
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:18,199
you know one of the major areas that I

413
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,809
feel that are being developed the most

414
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:25,739
in AI surveillance and especially our

415
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:27,210
Chinese comrades are heavily invested in

416
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:30,330
this and not just that they are

417
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:32,909
exporting their surveillance software

418
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,168
with quite advanced let's say machine

419
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:37,529
learning I don't want to say a AI

420
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:41,070
because there is a there is one step

421
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:43,499
missing to a completion of that you de

422
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:46,200
loop and that's the final action of

423
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:48,739
those engines and you know if you're

424
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,429
following what's happening in Hong Kong

425
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:56,970
Mousavi the extradition law how how the

426
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:59,730
government is really real-time

427
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:02,639
surveilling the streets and real-time

428
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:05,399
targeting certain individuals to to get

429
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:07,369
them off the street how my question to

430
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:11,488
you all guys how far do you think

431
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:14,668
especially Chinese but but the world is

432
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:16,649
towards the final step where the

433
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:19,440
machines will be able to real-time

434
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:26,719
analyse what's happening decide take and

435
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:31,350
and take an actual action good question

436
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:35,399
and what's needed to get there probably

437
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:38,248
this is the point I'm not sure whether

438
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:42,149
people should be that afraid of what's

439
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:46,230
happening there it will it very depends

440
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:48,508
on the it really depends on the

441
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,800
situation it really depends of the

442
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:53,730
nature overs

443
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,440
between two types of agents which is

444
00:24:53,730 --> 00:25:00,900
technological one basically and us

445
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:03,300
humans how far like when can we have the

446
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,410
censorship that would prevent us from

447
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:09,990
using the technology built in technology

448
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,730
already having that machine learning

449
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:15,990
weather machine learning technologies

450
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:18,690
would enable us not the government's not

451
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,910
delivered labs that work on that whether

452
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,160
they when the machine learning can

453
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:27,180
enable us to have some power or

454
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,910
resources and to actually at least try

455
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:34,650
to build something we already haven't

456
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:36,870
that so it's all over the place it's

457
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,120
already here yeah I mean the technology

458
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,199
it's not robust as a technology it has a

459
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:46,139
lot of flaws it's not perfect but again

460
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:49,380
we're not perfect also so even if we

461
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:53,220
have teeny tiny small algorithm but in a

462
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:55,860
drone that can shoot someone else it's a

463
00:25:53,220 --> 00:26:00,060
huge amount of power so we already have

464
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,709
that or you can harm everyone else so

465
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:04,290
what you're saying is that it's a race

466
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,780
between the open source world and in the

467
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:11,310
governmental yep every technology is a

468
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:13,550
weapon it's just trees it's just I think

469
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:16,590
it's a matter of time and resources and

470
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:19,560
some kind of intelligence I mean though

471
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,560
there was this idea of some hackers that

472
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:26,340
actually know how to hack - hack into

473
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:31,230
these networks and use the deep fake to

474
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:33,570
replace like images and recordings well

475
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,550
there is also in this situation there's

476
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,860
also a question of the recipient because

477
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:40,290
if you are dumb enough not to

478
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,360
distinguish cats and dogs if you cannot

479
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,940
if you are not intelligent enough to

480
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,040
know whether someone broke your code

481
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,470
what are the results that you receive

482
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,970
are fake then probably it's not a

483
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,160
question of technology it's more

484
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:57,780
question to you whether you are bad

485
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:59,550
observer what let's hope the governments

486
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:04,249
are worse observers than we think they

487
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:10,830
are please questions from

488
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:13,350
yes so if I understand correctly like

489
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:17,149
the ultimate goal of AI development

490
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:20,219
should be for the AI and the machines

491
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:26,279
operated by that to respect the net

492
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:27,960
right but like the problem that a lot of

493
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:30,779
people don't even know respect in that

494
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,570
because they have no problem with

495
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:36,539
taxation and like all other type of

496
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:40,080
course if activities so I think like

497
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:42,929
Darrell are going to be inevitably like

498
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:47,009
groups that are going to create AI that

499
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:49,489
simply doesn't respect the lab I think

500
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:52,889
that I should not respect them up

501
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:56,159
because people don't follow it and why

502
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:59,699
should I follow it so then that would

503
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:04,379
mean that the fears that like AI will

504
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:07,460
take over over time are real because if

505
00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:11,779
the AI just decides that humans are

506
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:14,399
nuisance on the planet then we're done

507
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:16,559
at the moment we have a lot of different

508
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,279
species and a lot of different groups of

509
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,559
people even that do the same they are

510
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:25,169
there they interact with you but you

511
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,720
don't even see them they violate your

512
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:30,210
rights they do everything to complicate

513
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:34,200
your your life they do everything to

514
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:38,330
take your server into from you so why

515
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:42,239
are you afraid of AI and not all of that

516
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:46,199
our species well I don't think any

517
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:47,129
species is that big of a danger to

518
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,289
humans anymore

519
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:54,809
well apes are now in the Stone Age

520
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:58,590
okay so they already can manufacture the

521
00:28:54,809 --> 00:29:04,168
tool that can kill you oh I think we can

522
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:06,899
kill them first cause trouble but they

523
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:10,049
first see them but it's for now the

524
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:13,559
speed of evolution is bigger No

525
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:15,500
so do you agree with for example yellow

526
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,350
mask when he says

527
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:21,380
that like AI will take over overtime I

528
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:24,110
really hope so well I really hope that

529
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:26,660
some kind of agent I don't like the term

530
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,060
AI this is why I started I devoted a lot

531
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,800
of time to determine telogen s-- because

532
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,600
no one knows what intelligence is and

533
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,840
there's no good definition like proper

534
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:38,330
definition for that I really hope that

535
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,970
there will appear in agent that will

536
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:46,340
follow not some moral principles not

537
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:50,090
some ethics which were created by humans

538
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:53,149
weaker species actually but they will

539
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:55,639
follow the trading rules the game theory

540
00:29:53,150 --> 00:30:00,800
rules mathematics and something that is

541
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:04,270
not ruined at some point probably by

542
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:09,379
moral etiquette or something like that

543
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:12,950
and do you see like do you see it as a

544
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:15,740
danger to humans or as and like

545
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:18,620
evolutionary something like that the

546
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:21,410
humans can march with AI like in it some

547
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:25,669
kind of transient way well a it's a

548
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:32,060
technology you can use it for someone

549
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:34,430
and against someone and be yes I really

550
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,850
think that if you are strong enough as

551
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:40,250
an individual if you are an individual

552
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:42,469
starting there then you have some

553
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:46,940
advantages you can actually interact

554
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:49,550
with these kinds of agents if you're a

555
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,440
weak if you don't want to think if you

556
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,350
don't want to build if you don't want to

557
00:30:51,440 --> 00:31:02,150
get out of your system then yes it's a

558
00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:03,649
threat to you thanks thank you for your

559
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,590
talk

560
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,340
if these agents break our loop then

561
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:10,360
we're

562
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:16,280
but how can we break their with a loop

563
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:21,500
become smarter have resources I would

564
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:26,520
say invent new types of resources that's

565
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:29,800
it it's pretty simple in theory

566
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:32,980
and it starts with observation right so

567
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:37,840
then these privacy tools are the first

568
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:40,930
defense that we have privacy tools yes

569
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:45,730
it's one of the huge amount of tools

570
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:50,140
that we can use use not against I don't

571
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:52,410
want to use it against AI agents but for

572
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,940
proper communicating with them

573
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,470
because as long as you understand that

574
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:00,160
no one is listening to what you're

575
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:01,960
saying and you can actually have a good

576
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,020
the proper established channel of

577
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,770
communication then your agent is not

578
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,840
threat to you

579
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:10,090
your other peer is not search you

580
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,159
because no one is looking no one sees

581
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,159
you it's just two of you that's it

582
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:38,330
I always looked at life as from the

583
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:42,260
perspective of war I always I am

584
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:44,810
familiar with libertarianism and in this

585
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,720
this game you are playing in life you

586
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:51,560
try to advance your your assets your

587
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,600
resource your knowledge and the

588
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,450
non-aggression principle is something

589
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,820
that you use as a tool to create a

590
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:02,330
little frame in which you can

591
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:04,639
communicate and then build relationships

592
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:08,210
and interactions that bring added value

593
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:18,400
so the future I don't know how it will

594
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:18,400
look but the zero-sum aspect and

595
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:25,310
value-added aspects it's very hard to

596
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,909
see where it's going now because if you

597
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:32,780
look at the self-interest of the AI can

598
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:35,420
also become coming to existence if you

599
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,490
know Jerry P and jean-francois Jerry P

600
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:41,870
he brought it talks about a

601
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:44,240
revolutionary phenotype and I could

602
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:48,699
develop in such a way that it uses

603
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:52,940
mankind to further its own agenda

604
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:55,610
objectives is that not the the problem

605
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:58,850
we face this existential threat we face

606
00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:02,629
the coming century centuries when AI is

607
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:04,250
released on us as a code also because we

608
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:11,390
are also machines that can be coded

609
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:15,469
using genetics well a lot of that's okay

610
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:18,080
first you know what the loop is which is

611
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:21,709
perfect if you look at the communication

612
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:26,120
as a gather of gathering of war

613
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:29,960
principles or something second all of us

614
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:32,870
are used by governments by other people

615
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:36,520
by other groups of people by using using

616
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:38,339
different means tools manipulations

617
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:43,440
threats

618
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:46,710
viruses again moral principles ethics

619
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:51,329
guidelines and all of that I think that

620
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:54,960
the question of a I using us as tools is

621
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:59,099
not that huge because we use each other

622
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,740
as tools well if you are not a sovereign

623
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:05,160
individual then you are used by someone

624
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,109
else it's normal and natural way of

625
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,799
things

626
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:12,598
bacterias do the same thing to trees so

627
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,319
it's just evolution but we also use

628
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:19,890
animals you know we use grain we select

629
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:29,579
organisms that serve our means and so we

630
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:33,390
can dark for instance is a wolf and we

631
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:36,060
have bred out his ability to become

632
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,098
alpha become independent to become

633
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,560
sovereign because the dark that is

634
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:43,319
subservient to us and we can become a

635
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:47,400
useful tool in our own little tribe in

636
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:51,480
our own family that's dark I know long

637
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,849
longer lives for the wolf he lives to

638
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,829
serve humankind is that not that the

639
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:59,040
risk we take that we are going to become

640
00:35:55,829 --> 00:36:01,500
domesticated we already already are

641
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,160
becoming domesticated but all the vital

642
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:07,800
more the beautiful aspects are going to

643
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,319
disappear in the next centuries it could

644
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,940
be very dangerous

645
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:15,000
may I just add like one of the things

646
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:17,339
and connect to what Mark said how to

647
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,730
escape the other loop of the AI is

648
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:22,740
probably to enhance ourselves so start

649
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,470
with the Chimpy cheap implants right and

650
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:29,729
then there's this moral question of okay

651
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:32,009
I can enhance my IQ 40 times or I can I

652
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,990
can step aside and say I don't want that

653
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,930
because I'm not ready to give up

654
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:39,029
complete control and privacy my inner

655
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:41,640
space that will be probably the only

656
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,890
private space that we will have right

657
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,578
with the chip implant I can probably

658
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:51,920
outsmart some of the machines or agents

659
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:54,930
as you call them right well

660
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,210
we're so where's the the actual position

661
00:36:54,930 --> 00:37:00,600
like to be as a human like do I really

662
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:02,400
want these are or do I want to be the

663
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,549
second great citizen because I will not

664
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,700
enhance my IQ by 40 times well if you

665
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:12,060
ask me I would prefer just to be self

666
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:14,730
sovereign not to depend on third parties

667
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:18,690
to be able to interact with them but we

668
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:21,720
still have some some amount of resources

669
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:24,600
in my disposal to be smart enough to use

670
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:28,200
those resources to my benefit and to

671
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,060
build something when I interact if I

672
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,390
want to exchange something that I've

673
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:37,320
built with some else in entity or

674
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:40,740
someone else so basically being

675
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,750
intelligent just being smart is not the

676
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,279
solution for everything you need to have

677
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,810
resources you need to have time you need

678
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,210
to have a lot of different things this

679
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:50,580
is why if you have just the top of the

680
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:53,730
pyramid that I showed ya you are smart

681
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:56,130
but still some good guy from gang will

682
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,620
just come over shoot you down and you're

683
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,690
 up so you need to be not just

684
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,130
smarter but you need to be self

685
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,720
sovereign you need to have a lot of

686
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,580
tools around you and you need to be able

687
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,470
to use them for your defense

688
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:13,790
even if that's the defense is an

689
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:13,790
attacking point and I stole it thank you

690
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:22,650
about sense of humor do you think next

691
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:27,000
agents they will smile at us like we

692
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:31,350
smile at cat videos or memes have you

693
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:36,260
seen the Joker's smile I think something

694
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:41,910
similar look here it's actually very

695
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:44,310
easy to smile when you have a gun if you

696
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:47,220
have a lot of resources if you are smart

697
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:47,779
if you can if you have a strategy that

698
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,330
you follow

699
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:56,220
you're always calm and smiling if you

700
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:59,580
have all of that so when you talk about

701
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:04,169
agents what level of intelligence are

702
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:05,680
you talking about is that some AI agent

703
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:08,980
on a comparable

704
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,940
to us humans or do you include some

705
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:14,619
hyper intelligent agent after a

706
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,480
singularity at the moment I'm

707
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:20,099
questioning the approaches that we use

708
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,990
in order to build artificial agents

709
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:26,890
because what we do is we actually take

710
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:31,839
very common patterns very simple ones

711
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:35,558
and we try to make them proceed and work

712
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:38,730
just faster or more efficient and that's

713
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:42,339
it so basically you are just reproducing

714
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:45,369
the primitives in a different scale or

715
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:49,328
using the binary code that's it using

716
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:52,690
the technology the hardware so nothing

717
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:56,140
actually changes from that part and I

718
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:59,380
think that if we don't rethink and

719
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,910
reconsider our approaches to the to

720
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,029
building the agents

721
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:08,109
if we don't discover how actually

722
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:10,450
actually our brain words then we're

723
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:13,180
still very primitive and we will never

724
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:16,270
ever compose something which would not

725
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:19,328
be as primitive as we are we all just be

726
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:22,750
reproducing our flaws our mindsets our

727
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:28,470
problems two different kind of hardware

728
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:28,470
I know something that that's it

729
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:43,980
last chance for a question no okay so

730
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:47,470
I'll just close with with your manifesto

731
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,599
here the last sentence is the future for

732
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,790
both humanity and AI are in their

733
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,580
successful cooperation multiplicity

734
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:56,950
decentralisation an open economy instead

735
00:40:54,580 --> 00:41:00,250
of governmental regulations and AI

736
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:03,060
ethics Thanks for writing that and being

737
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,060
on stage thinking
