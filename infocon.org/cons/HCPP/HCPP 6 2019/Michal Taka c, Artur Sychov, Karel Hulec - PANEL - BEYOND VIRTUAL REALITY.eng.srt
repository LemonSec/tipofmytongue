Michael please stage is yours and ok

30
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:39,909
thank you very much No so let me very

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,909
quickly introduce you to the dead

32
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:45,909
central and project how many of you know

33
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:50,440
this implant no very good very good

34
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:54,520
ok so very basically this entrant is a

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:59,140
web-based virtual virtual reality

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:02,199
platform that is built on top of a

37
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,530
Tyrian blockchain and and ilium and a

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,128
dream ecosystem the 3d world you see

39
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:13,450
behind me is it's actually it's actually

40
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:16,829
represented by land smart contract or a

41
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:20,859
non-fan jabal token called land token

42
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,379
the land token is basically sliced into

43
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:27,280
more than 90,000

44
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:31,000
Parcells each parcel the size of each

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,290
parcel is 16 by 16 meters and each

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,110
parcel is also it's also represented by

47
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:45,859
by a Cartesian coordinate

48
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:50,730
and and why each user can build or

49
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:57,420
create experiences games applications

50
00:02:50,730 --> 00:03:01,109
and stuff on on his land there are many

51
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,260
types of of parcels each user can own

52
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,090
one parcel or multiple parcels if the

53
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,620
user owns multiple parcels we call it

54
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,950
estates but the thing is the state is

55
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:16,740
the collection of adjacent parcels there

56
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,040
are there is a third type of of parcel

57
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,860
or set of parcels and that's called a

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:28,230
district and basically district is

59
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:32,520
usually operated by buy a bigger of buy

60
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:38,700
a bigger community of users that share

61
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:41,540
some some interest okay know at the

62
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,700
center on platform you consists of four

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,790
depths the first one is it's called

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,488
marketplace and that's where all the all

65
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:55,049
the transaction happens where you can

66
00:03:50,489 --> 00:04:00,269
buy or sell land or even rent it the

67
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:04,890
next tab is called it's called Builder

68
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:07,709
and is really a builder is really good

69
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,429
yeah because a lot of people that that

70
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:15,030
owned land is not they are not 3d

71
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:18,690
modelers or designers so it's really

72
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:23,130
easy to build something and put put the

73
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:25,760
stuff they create on their parcels from

74
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:29,250
from Builder you can really easily

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:38,219
publish your your creations to your

76
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:41,880
lands another dep is called we called

77
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,100
avatars it's that because you need to be

78
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,919
represented by something in the 3d world

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,280
and they are represented by by our

80
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,280
towers

81
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:56,690
and the fourth fourth up for Deb

82
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,260
actually is called Agora you can see it

83
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:03,979
right now without Agora we could not

84
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:07,580
call the center on this entrant the

85
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:12,650
Agora helps community members to vote on

86
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:14,659
some issues or vote on future stuff they

87
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:19,729
should be implemented into the central

88
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:22,790
and so that's basically it the center

89
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:26,810
line is right now in in public beta you

90
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:30,050
can join but by going to the central orc

91
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:34,280
it should be open to everybody in the in

92
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:37,600
the end of this year so I hope you you

93
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:47,869
give it a try and send some feedback

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:50,030
that it from me okay Thank You Miguel

96
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,429
into this VR topic and right now I would

97
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,080
like to invite our to see how who work

strongly believes in the ultimate future

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,530
of the virtual world which is something

107
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,450
amen raised the Lord yes hi I'm Artur

108

and I'm founder and CEO of some new

109
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:27,740
space a true virtual reality world yeah

110
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,610
let's go a little bit back into the past

111
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,360
[Music]

112
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:38,310
my online here I love you you the men so

113
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,770
yeah so this is the game I played too

114
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,770
many too many times in my life maybe too

115
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,740
much and this was created in 1999 and

116
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,318
what it introduced is you know this vast

117
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,569
multiple multiplayer world where people

118
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,520
can actually meet and do things together

119
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:56,069
like call themselves Labour's and

120
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,930
newbies that was very popular thing to

121
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,270
do there and they were fighting and

122
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,610
running around and also only houses and

123
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,940
owning piece of land and of course not

124
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,740
long took while the world came become

125
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,340
cluttered so many people wanted to play

126
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,590
that and and there was not enough place

127
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,198
basically the map had not enough place

128
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:18,448
for all the people to put their to put

129
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,400
their houses so it created kind of a

130
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,860
virtual first version of virtual economy

131
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,989
where people actually were paying $1,000

132
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,490
for someone to release the land for them

133
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,650
and they were buying another house and

134
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,460
putting into it on that land so huge

135
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,529
amount of money

136
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,930
I was also earning money on that and

137
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:36,930
playing it so first kind of glimpse into

138
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:40,650
the virtual economy people were trading

139
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,900
trading a lot of potions and Swartz and

140
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,060
a lot of items in general so yeah very

141
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,900
interesting game now fast-forward to

142
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,310
2003 I guess you all know Second Life

143
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,830
which is you know a very popular

144
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,469
platform and it introduced a little bit

145
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,940
of 3d graphics kind of a first kind of

146
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:59,580
like what you see in just in the central

147
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,610
and so people were able to go in 3d walk

148
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,779
around and and stuff like that and it

149
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,969
also had lent ownership concept and it

150
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,250
also had an ability or for people to

151
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,229
actually trade some items and and do

152
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,469
some cool stuff and that cool stuff

153
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:19,710
actually still generates more than 500

154
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:22,589
million u.s. dollars turnover for second

155
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:26,039
life even in 2018 yes this game still

156
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:27,870
exists and you know this this is an

157
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,080
amazing thing people are able to earn

158
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,120
net profit of 60 million players to

159
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:37,169
their pockets so that's that's an

160
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,929
amazing stuff now we of course ask

161
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,478
ourselves what's next what is what is

162
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,559
beyond second life and simple 3d

163
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,389
environment

164
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,599
what is what is beyond that and of

165
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:50,610
course and of course we believe that's

166
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,550
that's virtual reality that's something

167
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,689
which should be in VR and the place

168
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,790
where you will be able to immerse

169
00:08:54,689 --> 00:09:01,069
yourself but in order to build something

170
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:04,050
in VR it has to have kind of three three

171
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:07,229
stages and three things to come together

172
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,240
and first of that is it has to look

173
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,850
great it has to be you know you have to

174
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,259
have stunning visuals in order to trick

175
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,240
your brain to believe that you are

176
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,860
inside that world so the beauty of

177
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,019
virtual reality world is that when you

178
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,699
put the headset on you believe that

179
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,759
you're inside that world and the better

180
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:26,008
it looks the better physic works the

181
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,329
better world is simulated more you

182
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:28,949
believe that you're inside and more you

183
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:31,258
believe that the you know things you see

184
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:32,779
are actually real things so it has to

185
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:35,370
look stunning

186
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,800
now of course also you have to be able

187
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,959
to create stuff you have to be able to

188
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,729
create avatars you have to be able to

189
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,529
build on your land you have to be able

190
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,689
to you know sell the things so that's

191
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:47,610
very important because then of course

192
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:50,759
you can share your experiences and

193
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,370
create economy so coming to the economy

194
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:57,480
you have to be able to fully own things

195
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,759
you you create and in order to do that

196
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,839
you have to kind of you know it has to

197
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,790
be it has to be on the blockchain

198
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,670
because that's the only way how you can

199
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:12,149
truly own some items inside the game

200
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:13,769
today in in in 2019 let's say now I

201
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:15,660
guess I don't need to explain you that

202
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:17,220
but let's have a look in a quick example

203
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,709
what's happening with all the games you

204
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,750
are playing today any game you play has

205
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:23,609
this thing everything you own in that

206
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,680
game and you played it for years I mean

207
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,170
I played out him online for 10 years and

208
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,029
everything I owned wasn't my account on

209
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,709
the server that company and once the

210
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,389
company decides to Bend me for whatever

211
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:36,479
reason and unfortunately for me they

212
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:39,059
decided to do so I lost everything

213
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,050
literally I lost seven years of my work

214
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:45,689
and thousands of dollars of virtual

215
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:49,139
property I owned and I still I have

216
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:51,809
nothing now on the other hand in the

217
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:54,000
decentralized economy if it's on

218
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:56,579
blockchain you own all the tokens all

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,450
the items be the land be it a car be the

220
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,430
Swart

221
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,770
whatever you created or someone else

222
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,500
told you you own that so even if we as

223
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,199
some news place decide to ban you again

224
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,450
for whatever reason whatever you do you

225
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,370
can still go and resell those items to

226
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,430
the marketplace and get your money back

227
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,160
or you can be even more tricky you can

228
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,839
actually create a new account transfer

229
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,120
from one wallet to another all the items

230
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,010
and enjoy playing on under the new

231
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,040
account of course don't do it but you

232
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,900
can still do it now that's an example of

233
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,849
integration of blockchain inside virtual

234
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,660
reality world we all know creep the

235
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,890
kiddies who knows cryptic it is

236
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,839
beautiful so now you can put your crib

237
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:40,680
luckily inside virtual reality and

238
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:44,240
actually play with your kitty so this is

239
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:48,660
our builder you choose your parcel and

240
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,790
and you can just place the kitty if you

241
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,079
have if you have it in your wallet

242
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,430
because our client recognizes your

243
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,170
wallet you connect to the two-legged

244
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,229
client and then he scans on the items

245
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,959
you have and then and then you have your

246
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,270
kitty which looks at you runs around and

247
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,820
you can actually experience that in full

248
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,650
virtual reality and it's pretty fun I

249
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,680
must say it kind of breathes new life

250
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,689
into something you all know and I knew

251
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,020
this is my kitty by the way not for sale

252
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:20,730
so yeah that's that's that's one of the

253
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:22,020
things we're working on so what we are

254
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,520
building we're building kind of a

255
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,110
virtual reality world which is

256
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,819
persistent so all the players are all

257
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,560
the time in the same server we don't

258
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,120
divide people into sub servers mirrors

259
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,780
or whatever you know from other games

260
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,010
all are in the same huge world which is

261
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,199
partially procedurally generated and

262
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,910
it's you know it's just beautiful so

263
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,190
that's our map that's how it looks like

264
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:44,610
it's run about 6 square kilometers so

265
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,110
it's more than written here this is some

266
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,880
new Waypoint this is what we've built a

267
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,130
some new space this kind of the only

268
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,650
experience we have under our control

269
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:55,680
the rest is controlled by players again

270
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:57,360
every every item every parcel of the

271
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,359
land is on the token so it's an

272
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,190
ownership of the players so this is our

273
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,710
Waypoint where you can you know visit

274
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,990
planetarium you can go to shopping mall

275
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,310
arcade whole place time bowling you can

276
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,810
you can actually have fun and we're

277
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,310
adding some features all the time so one

278
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,439
examples which we are launching this

279
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,020
October is the new planetarium which is

280
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:21,270

you are about to witness amazing wonders

285
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,459
of our universe inside virtual reality

286
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,279
sit back relax and enjoy this

287
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:50,620

it's all well it's for free you can just

290
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,720
go there to the Waypoint go to the

291
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,199
planetarium and experience this 20

292
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,339
minutes journey into our solar system

293
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,709
now that's what's happening already in

294
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:06,310
our world today lots of meetings lots of

295
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:09,579
meetups live concerts talks and and just

296
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:12,459
a lot of a lot of fun we're having with

297
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:15,069
our community that's the land we're

298
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:16,750
selling that's the size of the land

299
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:18,099
that's what how it looks like inside the

300
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,579
client that's what we can buy and build

301
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,670
on that's actually very interesting

302
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:26,349
video that's how our indiegogo backers

303
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,660
who supported us in the beginning of the

304
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,519
year they were reserving their land and

305
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,980
this is the time-lapse of them reserving

306
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,740
the land so you see how city center

307
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,990
immediately got go taken by our players

308
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,180
because of course everybody appears in

309
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:45,490
the Waypoint so it will have higher

310
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:47,560
value those parcels so that's how the

311
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,529
map looks today with all the parcels

312
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,849
taken so 500 or 5,000 parcels are taken

313
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,529
but four and a half thousand will go to

314
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,360
sell out a little bit more later and

315
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:56,920
that's what we are buying that's that's

316
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,649
the real screenshot of the game that's

317
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,810
not a CGI there is no Photoshop involved

318
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:03,430
it's purely screenshot taking from the

319
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,550
screen and placed into the PowerPoint

320
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:09,459
presentation great views from the

321
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,229
parcels of course whether everything is

322
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,329
generated the whole world is

323
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,750
procedurally generated and never the

324
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:18,130
same teleportation you'll be able to

325
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,660
teleport the booths I mean who is

326
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,189
interested in more concept I can talk

327
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,130
about this for hours because I see me

328
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:26,949
hell shouting at me what do we have here

329
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:29,589
I'll skip that those are our partners

330
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:31,508
and the list is growing we are working

331
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:33,309
with many many companies so be haptics

332
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:35,050
for example and other companies to

333
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:37,420
include kind of real sensors into

334
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,279
virtual reality like the vibrations

335
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,349
you'd in the Tesla suit and then the

336
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,509
mask which generates smells and stuff so

337
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,960
we're also integrating SDKs to actually

338
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,280
be able to

339
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:52,470
for you know for players to approach it

340
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:56,650
and play yes so just to just to kind of

341
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,720
wrap it up the real matter verse which

342
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,180
we see in the movies or we read in the

343
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,710
books is actually closer than your all

344
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,319
thing because many people still think

345
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:08,350
that it's pure science fiction that is

346
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,730
10 20 50 years away actually it's

347
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,850
already happening whether it's announced

348
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:16,420
or or in in some new space or maybe in

349
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:18,460
in the 2d in decentraland but it's it's

350
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,400
happening people are already living this

351
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:24,730
virtual reality dream and this virtual

352
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,319
reality life and you can have very

353
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,200
profound experiences and of course

354
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,880
economy will be thriving in those worlds

355
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,010
if Second Life with this primitive

356
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,020
graphics that's a still great game but

357
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,870
primitive graphics can generate 500

358
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:40,180
million dollars revenue or turnover per

359
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,560
year today you can only imagine what can

360
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,420
be done in virtuality when you actually

361
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,300
really can own things and really see

362
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,280
things in a real perspective like a real

363
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,800
human being and of course we have some

364
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:54,430
new space we are dedicated to make the

365
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,680
best social world on the planet but yeah

366
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:00,880
we are very open to cooperate with any

367
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,469
company and we're doing so and yeah one

368
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,109
important thing tomorrow because the

369
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,089
great timing tomorrow our initial and

370
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:09,699
offering starts so you can go to our web

371
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:12,250
page look at our map and you can bid on

372
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,650
open sea if you know the the biggest

373
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,170
platform of crypto collectibles you can

374
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:19,780
bid on every parcel of the land and you

375
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,040
can actually purchase the land and own

376
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,990
it and then start building right away

377
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,959
our client is available and it's life

378
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:32,370
and yeah on behalf of some new space I'd

379
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:32,370
like to welcome you into our world

380
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:52,130
hey congratulations we've got a model

381
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,280
please

382
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,280

384
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,109
[Music]

385
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,030
thank you Thank You Arthur for a very

386
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:24,399
much for your presentation

387
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:27,490
and really what came on my mind during

388
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,110
your presentation was the the also the

389
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,520
reason why we organized this talk

390
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,799
because the the question the original

391
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,530
question is like if people can opt out

392
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,500
to virtual world because as we see you

393
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,820
know and and the the balla of the Viper

394
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,960
a loop that came with this topic of

395
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:45,760
opting out he definitely was focusing

396
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,320
mostly on the on the state and

397
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,760
government but we also wanted to talk

398
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,040
and about opting out from different

399
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,870
services social services and so on so in

400
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,700
this panel for me and it's very

401
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,860
explaining lay the topic of opting out

402
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,690
to virtual space the virtual reality is

403
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,100
it a real thing you think it's

404
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,470
absolutely I mean we have people who are

405
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,090
already working full time in virtual

406
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,820
reality and making their living by being

407
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:08,230
inside virtual reality world so I guess

408
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,240
that's one of the answers but we can

409
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,130
dive deeper when after Carol

410
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,290
presentation thank you thank you perfect

411
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,240
okay and I would like to invite our last

412
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:19,480
president a lot of last presenter and

413
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:23,410
it's it's my pleasure to invite here on

414
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,450
stage Carol Hulot's he's a futurist

415
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,850
generalist and enthusiastic tech

416
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,799
analytic to the bone who has always neck

417
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,750
who has had a knack for combining

418
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,070
business and technology he joined the

419
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,049
cryptocurrency community and

420
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,299
cryptocurrency mining operations early

421
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:39,040
on reinvesting earnings to fund other

422
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:41,830
innovative decentralized project and

423
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,570
he's also VR projects starting with the

424
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,309
development and manufacturing of virtual

425
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,379
reality hardware and joining forces with

426
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,168
Tomas Maryann chick on advanced virtual

427
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,960
reality software development later on so

428
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:55,450
Carol stage is yours thank you so much

429
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,880
for the nice introduction it's it's a

430
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,070
big honor to being here today now and

431
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,429
I'm so I'm kara watts I'm one of the

432
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:06,450
founders of Neos virtuality Metaverse we

433
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:10,000
actually started as content creators

434
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:13,770
this is our project of virtual education

435
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,360
where we designed virtual worlds

436
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,950
multiplayer virtual worlds where

437
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,949
teachers and students can be together

438
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:25,059
and have an awesome learning experience

439
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,620
we also did a lot of projects for

440
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:27,980
virtuality in gaming engines

441
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,799
particularly unity

442
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,230
this is our must Effect Andromeda with

443
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,070
Bill Nye experienced it's probably our

444
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:40,760
last a unity project and so when we were

445
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:45,168
tasked with this immense tasked to

446
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:48,230
create to create educational worlds

447
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:50,659
multiplayer education worlds that that

448
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:55,220
will last for ten tenths of years and a

449
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:58,220
lot of people will learn in them then we

450
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,649
were searching for a platform where we

451
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,169
could scale this effort with a lot of

452
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:06,469
collaborators sort of creators schools

453
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:09,919
and we found ourselves in need of a new

454
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,950
platform for social virtuality and we

455
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,230
found also almost all of our colleagues

456
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,570
first up from virtual reality and

457
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,000
augmented reality startups having the

458
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,590
same problems having to say solve the

459
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,130
same scalability problems again and

460
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:27,649
again so we found out that we are riding

461
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:31,220
a horse horses are great but they are

462
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:34,029
not made for human transportation we

463
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,649
wanted some a car or something that's

464
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:40,250
something that's really made for the

465
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:41,899
purpose for for social VR and gaming

466
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:46,340
engines or game engines are actually

467
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:52,279
made for offline games on on a monitor

468
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:55,699
and and so the solution for us is Neos

469
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:58,760
Metaverse the the big innovation and

470
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,669
what took us almost two years is the

471
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:04,190
underlying advanced data model and

472
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:08,779
synchronization engine we took a long

473
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:11,510
long time to make this engine really -

474
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:14,389
so we are satisfied with the engine

475
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:16,639
because once we open the the platform to

476
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:19,070
content creators we have to be careful

477
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:21,830
about not breaking their content so so

478
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:24,889
if you want so we had to make it really

479
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:29,230
scalable really future-proof and make

480
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:35,809
sure we can develop the engine also -

481
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:39,710
both in in in terms of user sizes of the

482
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:41,170
worlds and scales and not break existing

483
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,120
contents of Khan

484
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:48,250
creators that rely that their content

485
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,370
will work on our post form so the nice

486
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:53,890
side effect of having this awesome

487
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:57,370
underlying engine is that you can run

488
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:00,160
these Neos headless sessions which is

489
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:04,000
basically Neos without the the visuals

490
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,800
and it's it's a completely independent

491
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,840
of the rendering engine and it can be

492
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,610
around really efficiently which is

493
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,790
important for the economics of the

494
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:17,050
Metaverse and yeah and if infrastructure

495
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:20,649
costs are actually a big big deal in

496
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:22,570
terms of running big worlds and also

497
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,670
it's important for multi-platform

498
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:29,520
ability and compatibility with rendering

499
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:33,640
engines and and one of the biggest

500
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,100
positive impacts of having atomic

501
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,110
structure atomic data model is that

502
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,600
everything works with everything so

503
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:43,990
every tool every gadget every gun in

504
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,719
every game built-in Neos works in any on

505
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:49,030
any other planets on any other in any

506
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,190
other app that someone else has created

507
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,620
so you can take a gun from one game and

508
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,920
use it in another game and actually your

509
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:59,199
avatar which can be very complex

510
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,480
interactive thing actually works also in

511
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,330
in every environment every games some

512
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:10,420
creator has created or the creator's can

513
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:14,080
restrict what works in a world and can

514
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:17,740
make the world can can make like the

515
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,659
area of the world can limit it or limit

516
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,540
like what avatar can use what guns you

517
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,370
can use but by default everything is

518
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:28,000
synced so everyone sees the same thing

519
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:30,939
unless you don't want to so any else you

520
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,130
have to make effort to desync things but

521
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,830
actually everything you create is like

522
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:40,030
in real reality based reality everything

523
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,830
we see is more or less the same so it's

524
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:45,129
it's very effortless for the content

525
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,990
creators you can see our avatars are

526
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,540
very advanced probably the most advanced

527
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:52,120
we have full body tracking finger

528
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,520
tracking we have also full facial mimics

529
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,059
but there's that's a bit problematic to

530
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,490
actually get

531
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:59,529
the data the cameras you can use for

532
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,779
that are not easily available right now

533
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:04,690
and you can actually use almost

534
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:07,450
everything as your avatar even like non

535
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,610
humanoids and you can actually like

536
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,289
attach all of gadgets and have a lot of

537
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:15,029
functionality in the avatar have thought

538
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:17,889
of tools and have it really interactive

539
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:24,279
yeah we also have a tracking special

540
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:27,189
audio some universities use Neos this is

541
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:30,159
this is University of Sydney they have

542
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:32,679
actually the whole campus in Neos and

543
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,499
they do a lot of research mostly their

544
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:39,700
human factors lab they research how

545
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:42,879
people behave in emergency situations

546
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,940
and how to how to make better

547
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:51,789
environments and we have also

548
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:53,049
universities in Israel in Prague also we

549
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:56,169
are growing

550
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:57,850
Metaverse in terms of user base when you

551
00:25:56,169 --> 00:26:01,809
come to two news today you can meet

552
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:05,498
about 40 people at most times who

553
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:07,809
actually wear a VR headset and it makes

554
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:10,629
sure it actually makes sense in in Neos

555
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:13,299
to to be present inside not not on a

556
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:15,879
monitor but really to have a VR headset

557
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:17,679
and have have two to two hands because

558
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:20,830
the interaction and actually also

559
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,230
content creation is done from within so

560
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:26,460
not on a monitor by clicking a mouse but

561
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:29,649
really you create virtual spaces in Neos

562
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,279
in news for Neos in Neos

563
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:35,379
so you will need your hands and you have

564
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,830
creative tools that also are created

565
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:41,469
inside and you can share the tools and

566
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:45,759
yeah so we have our own cryptocurrency

567
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:48,759
we think that the our role as a meta

568
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,460
verse as a meta universe is to manage

569
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:54,549
the the universe economy so we have

570
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:58,840
meant it so far almost 2 million news

571
00:26:54,549 --> 00:27:01,779
credits and there's only going to be 50

572
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,439
million total but most of most of that

573
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:07,629
is our patreon supporters or like early

574
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,509
supporters we don't market this much

575
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:10,980
right now

576
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:14,490
it's it's not listed on any major

577
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,759
exchanges yet in terms of like for

578
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:20,129
fungible items we are looking for

579
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,379
technical solutions how to solve like

580
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:26,459
people stealing the items because you

581
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:28,590
can easily on unpair the asset from from

582
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,539
from its hash and you actually can start

583
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:33,090
the assets on on a blockchain because

584
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:34,590
the blockchain will get huge right and

585
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:38,279
so we are looking for solutions how to

586
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:40,049
how to detect like I said that that has

587
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,019
been modified just a little bit so the

588
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:45,179
hash is different and it doesn't pair

589
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:48,240
and we don't sell property we think it's

590
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:49,740
like the the role of world so in terms

591
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,139
of like some new space it makes sense

592
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,929
because it's like like a limited world

593
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:56,969
but in in terms of Neos we don't manage

594
00:27:54,929 --> 00:28:01,980
the world we just managed the post for

595
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:04,679
more or less so our role is having the

596
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:09,749
economics tied together but not really

597
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:12,119
managing the the world yeah we are we

598
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:15,749
will be releasing by the end of the

599
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:17,789
month by the end of the year a Metaverse

600
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:22,379
training experience where you can come

601
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:24,809
and learn how to how to participate in

602
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:27,570
yours right now Neos is used mostly by

603
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:29,908
professionals mostly by people who know

604
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:36,418
someone who told them to work in yours

605
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:39,629
do you I will get a big big redesign

606
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:42,389
pretty soon also and and we have a crazy

607
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:45,719
vision our crazy visions are really good

608
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:48,209
even if you don't manage to even get

609
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,999
close to the realizing your whole vision

610
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,789
this is a young boy called the chief

611
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:56,249
Vsauce you may know him he's the richest

612
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:58,970
man on earth and this is his high school

613
00:28:56,249 --> 00:29:02,850
article about how he wants to bring

614
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:07,590
humanity to space and wants to make

615
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:11,189
actually our planets of PLA protected

616
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:14,668
landscape area like a park Kakaako near

617
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:16,799
Alta and and fundamentally what you need

618
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,509
so to make this happen it's great engine

619
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,080
because we don't have like Granger's

620
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:25,320
petition from Earth to orbit around the

621
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,629
moon yeah

622
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,149
and and so you need an engine that uses

623
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,850
an organic fuel because organic fuel is

624
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:37,199
not easy to get in space you have to

625
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:40,049
make it reusable and and with that you

626
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,909
have basically in our solar system you

627
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:46,710
have like 10 to 15 times more resources

628
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:49,559
than we have on earth and at that point

629
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,990
earth is like Park it's not really

630
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:56,220
interesting in an economic terms and we

631
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:59,970
can make it PLA yeah you have you only

632
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:02,669
need like 7.5 ton of of mass when you

633
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:07,850
are living you know like oh no surrender

634
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:12,000
or Dyson swarm on earth we need about 12

635
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:14,070
12 billion tons per each meter square -

636
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,600
so between the red gravity so it's very

637
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:21,990
ineffective yeah in the same same way

638
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:26,158
using base reality is also ineffective

639
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:29,210
so we if the future could be simulating

640
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,880
reality and when you see much reality

641
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:36,690
it's it's about 10 to 30 times more

642
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,730
effective than staying on earth and so

643
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,590
we with the tree with those resources we

644
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:44,220
can make a whole base reality basically

645
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:47,639
or protected landscape area Kakaako

646
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:51,000
neeraja there will be the big vision and

647
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:56,370
that's that's what we develop Neos

648
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:01,070
whatever's in mind with yeah thank you

649
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:04,469
very much thank you thank you carol and

650
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:06,860
i will ask every speaker to please come

651
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,860
to stage

652
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,350
I have a few other questions which are

653
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,959
ready ready but I also would like ask

654
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,719
you audience to join us later on with

655
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,399
your questions because you know this is

656
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,370
how it should be you know that you are

657
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,189
involved in this in this discussion I

658
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:40,279
want to just fall because after with

659
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:44,159
your presentation I was like thinking of

660
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:46,980
opting out me I'm right but with Carol

661
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,649
presentation thinking of it if we are

662
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:53,159
really living in a simulation also

663
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:54,840
because the things oh okay so we are

664
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:57,720
opting out to simulation this is the

665
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,760
like outcome of the topic that what I

666
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,740
would like to ask is like you mentioned

667
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,140
that already like some Australian

668
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,789
University has a campus editor

669
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,529
so how come what was the approach that

670
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:09,120
you start to cooperate with such an

671
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:11,520
institution what's the background like

672
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,100
this is interesting for me so mostly in

673
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:18,389
companies or universities that use Neos

674
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:21,678
the the thing that makes it makes it

675
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:24,240
happen it's really a single person who

676
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,880
found out about Neos in their spare time

677
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,309
so we don't market it to people it's

678
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,159
just like our users happen to work at a

679
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:34,470
university and then they then they

680
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,929
implement it in their workplace and also

681
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:40,049
then when one university has it they

682
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:44,309
showcase it and other institution wants

683
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:46,770
to get in on it this organic way also an

684
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:48,720
example I mean exactly just they find

685
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:51,049
out and in our case it's they are

686
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,000
indicators in VR it's a group of

687
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:56,190
professors in universities from UK to

688
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,260
Australia to United States and they

689
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,399
found out about some loom and then they

690
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,679
just bought land and they want to build

691
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:03,620
school there so exactly they just find

692
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,320
out about that and they start using it

693
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:09,959
so that's maybe maybe our true kata is

694
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,210
more a little bit about your approach to

695
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,070
the corporations and have you involved

696
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:17,309
the cooperations into the into your

697
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:20,039
assam namespace very simple it's open

698
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:21,720
for anyone to use right so tomorrow

699
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,950
everyone can just go and bid for the

700
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,080
land buy the land and start building

701
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:28,540
whether it's a corporation or a private

702
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,879
citizen or a person or a

703
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,740
a bunch of people friends whatever they

704
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,080
can just start building and we don't

705
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,929
control basically who is there they

706
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,000
don't need to go through QIA or anything

707
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:44,590
like that they just can you know buy and

708
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,600
start building Michel and I have a

709
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,199
question for you I know that you are in

710
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,918
a little different position because

711
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,320
Carol Arthur they're like the creators

712
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:59,320
like the owners or the people behind and

713
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,570
you you worked for the central and you

714
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,700
you as a developer helping to develop

715
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:06,360
project but I would like to see from

716
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,119
like your point of view is it like

717
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,549
possible to build such like

718
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:18,639
decentralized VR project these or any in

719
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:22,869
the future as a developer no definitely

720
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,750
yeah but in in in our case we are we

721
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:27,460
were in in different position because at

722
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:32,350
the center and we decided to go with

723
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:38,530
open platform of the web so we actually

724
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:40,929
moved in in a loop somehow and it took

725
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:46,240
us really a long time to actually

726
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:49,770
develop something usable and even right

727
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:53,229
now you cannot have full VR experience

728
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:55,168
even even when we when we launch in in

729
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:59,500
the end of the year it's mostly like a

730
00:34:55,168 --> 00:35:02,470
mobile based VR I would say so yeah it's

731
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:06,150
it depends on what platform you choose

732
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,149
and you need to choose wisely

733
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:17,560
yeah okay my fever we were discussing

734
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,660
before and what I was looking

735
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:24,310
interesting you were all referring to

736
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:28,750
the communities like how like maybe

737
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:31,180
little describe like the the community

738
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,220
like how you have you have you build it

739
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:36,160
like what was the important thing but

740
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,140
where you are focusing gone like any of

741
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,790
you if you like to because I think I see

742
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,830
that the community and this is very

743
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,160
important like I think it's hundred

744
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,799
percent

745
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,839
the most important thing and we chosen a

746
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,030
different approach then like for example

747
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,400
the central and we decided at first we

748
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:55,120
released the product so we released our

749
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,010
first version of our vision and then

750
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,440
people started to download it started to

751
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:01,270
play and they of course they had a lot

752
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,270
of comments they had a lot of thoughts

753
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:06,550
they liked a lot of things and and then

754
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:08,259
we took that information from them so we

755
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,240
started to grow we took that information

756
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,580
and that's why we're releasing the new

757
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,669
version which is 50 times better than

758
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:17,410
what we used to have and and while we

759
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,950
were building it the community has grown

760
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:22,299
we were all meeting in VR all the time

761
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,580
and then when we ran our IndieGoGo

762
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,580
campaign and sitting with our campaign

763
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,380
so we we just sold like $200,000 worth

764
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,940
of virtual land at that campaigns just

765
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,320
in the beginning we did no advertising

766
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,170
we didn't spend a single dollar

767
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,290
advertising anything it's just word of

768
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:40,360
mouth people supporting people and right

769
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:42,460
now we have and of course you will say

770
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:45,010
the same but I think we have the best

771
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,500
community out there super friendly

772
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:53,650
people I know a lot of people from there

773
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:57,310
so yeah yeah I can agree with that yeah

774
00:36:53,650 --> 00:37:00,160
we focused on content creators basically

775
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:04,509
we were trying to be the tool they need

776
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:07,390
to create their creations and to be the

777
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:11,680
platform that and where they create the

778
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:13,839
most they like to create the most so and

779
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,109
a lot of the meta vs. actually tried to

780
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:21,580
bribe users to like come to their

781
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:24,280
Metaverse out to make like to give

782
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:26,380
everyone some amount of like their

783
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,720
cryptocurrency or something and and that

784
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,470
doesn't work like in a sustainable way

785
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,120
so we also think like organic growth

786
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:36,250
people really want to spend the time in

787
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,779
the Metaverse in the first place and

788
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,560
create content there is the most

789
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:44,080
important thing in the center it was

790
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,910
basically the the communities were

791
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:50,140
performing while we were developing the

792
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:53,250
descent land so so they were they were

793
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,900
trying to do - to make some proposals

794
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,640
for us to income in court

795
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,579
their communities into the central and

796
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:04,299
into the into districts and after a

797
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:05,950
while we ran I didn't I don't remember I

798
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:08,529
don't remember what it's called but

799
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:12,970
something like sale of land for

800
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:16,319
districts and the district and a group

801
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:20,680
of people who were under that district

802
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:25,349
could put some mana tokens into the into

803
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:29,770
the the sale and and buy some land and

804
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:32,710
as much it was like how much money you

805
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:36,130
put into it you could get that much

806
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:39,039
parcels out of that so that's that's how

807
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:45,099
the community is format their their

808
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:49,750
parcels and their their land thank you

809
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:51,760
I see that on one hand that that's why I

810
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,890
like ask about the community because I

811
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,170
see it's very very important but also I

812
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,609
think it's very much also like the

813
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,859
importance here is like personal

814
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:02,410
experience of the of the user who is

815
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:05,410
getting into metaphors and after when we

816
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:07,808
met first time and you will and we will

817
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,640
introducing me your project like I have

818
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:11,289
to be the person on I have to try to ask

819
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,250
it you know I didn't plan it but you

820
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:18,190
know you have to some shoot did you did

821
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:20,619
you have a date in virtual world would

822
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:23,470
you go for a date hey I mean I'm married

823
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:26,380
all right who kids but if I if I browse

824
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:28,689
in my dark past in Second Life

825
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,250
I I did had a date in Second Life and

826
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,910
actually dated a girl in second life

827
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:36,460
like a long long time ago and my all my

828
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,629
dream from Ultima Online in 1999 was

829
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,029
always you know reading all the books

830
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,760
was always to kind of be on the other

831
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:45,279
side of the monitor and the virtual

832
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,260
reality a true virtual reality is the

833
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:48,880
only way how to achieve that so when I

834
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,039
was dating that girl was sitting and

835
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,599
watching the sunrise a very basic

836
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,760
sunrise in Second Life

837
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,339
it was great but you know the dream was

838
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,500
to actually be there and right now with

839
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:01,089
somnium or Neos it's possible it's

840
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,279
finally possible to actually be and

841
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:04,990
touch people and you know shake hands

842
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:07,480
and and do stuff together so that's why

843
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:09,430
we are building it yes so Todd so the

844
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,890
direct leads to the other kind like

845
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:13,540
question like what's the limitations we

846
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:18,009
are right now we were discussing it

847
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:21,430
before like what's the limitation yep so

848
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,500
we are has a lot of possibilities like

849
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:26,230
Archer mentioned like meeting people

850
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,300
it's awesome and also it's also it's

851
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,400
environmentally sustainable so if you

852
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,369
have to fly somewhere to meet someone it

853
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,440
costs a lot of resources so actually

854
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:39,609
actually that's what we prefer out is

855
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:44,440
awesome for and and remote collaboration

856
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:46,029
in general yeah and I think the

857
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,800
limitations right now are mostly

858
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:50,579
hardware limitations because there's not

859
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,559
not like augmented reality device

860
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:56,470
everyone would like to wear and buy and

861
00:40:53,559 --> 00:41:00,700
use nor a virtual reality device these

862
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:03,848
are pretty big and uncomfortable to wear

863
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:06,069
like long hours so so definitely better

864
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:08,710
hardware devices that could be one of

865
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:10,839
the limitations but you have to say that

866
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,819
the progress of technology in terms of

867
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:14,920
hardware is amazing like every year we

868
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:16,569
get better and better hardware so I

869
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:22,720
think that software may be slightly

870
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:24,849
ahead here but yeah I think we're going

871
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,950
to see pretty soon great hardware like

872
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:30,190
everyone is going to be comfortable

873
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:33,129
where both of the yeah and I think not

874
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:36,670
only the headsets but things like haptic

875
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:38,650
suits where like I had myself Tesla suit

876
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:40,260
which is one of the leading let's say

877
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,520
haptic suits on the market which

878
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,770
basically you you you wear full-body

879
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,530
suit and then by using electrical

880
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:49,450
impulses it can generate or it can

881
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:53,260
simulate to you that you feel heat or

882
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:55,089
cold or or touch so like I ran through

883
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,160
simulations where they were simulating I

884
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:58,210
was looking at the rain in virtual

885
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,368
reality and they were simulating

886
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:02,440
raindrops on my shoulders and you really

887
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:05,020
feel it now I tried that last year there

888
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,790
was a first generation suit now if you

889
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,040
just extrapolate it into seven year or

890
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:10,839
five year period that suit will cost

891
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,450
five hundred dollars and will be able to

892
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:15,339
be in a home of every person so again

893
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,319
combining VR headsets which are getting

894
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:20,470
better just look at what Huawei just

895
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:22,210
released how it looks like with feud's

896
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:24,939
basically we can

897
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:26,740
put ourselves into VR and fully fully

898
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,230
immerse ourselves I would say within

899
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,669
five years six years definitely we're

900
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:32,620
not so far away from this if you take a

901
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:35,230
look at the presentation you unmasked it

902
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:37,810
with never link that then you can

903
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:40,030
imagine even going further with neural

904
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:44,830
interfaces making the narrow interfaces

905
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:46,180
really usable in real life that it would

906
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:49,000
be something we're looking forward

907
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:52,149
arrayed today Samsung has earphones like

908
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,010
normal Wireless had but which put to the

909
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,530
inner ear they put electrical impulses

910
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,060
and now when you wear VR headset and

911
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:59,770
you're sitting on the chair like I am

912
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,120
but you feel like you're flying for

913
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,380
example you don't need even to walk you

914
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,880
just feel like you're flying and it

915
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,080
exists already today and the only reason

916
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,490
why they didn't release it to the public

917
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:11,680
is the medical whatever certifications

918
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:13,479
they have to go through but imagine and

919
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,970
this earbuds will cost you fifty hundred

920
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,470
years and suddenly you'll be able to

921
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,970
feel like you're flying or falling or

922
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,859
jumping inside we are even though you

923
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:24,270
are sitting on one place I mean that's

924
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:28,600
already as close to matrix as we can get

925
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:31,450
okay and what about you like from as I

926
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:34,270
see still that I I agree with with the

927
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:36,339
boys that there are still limitations on

928
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:39,520
the hardware side I see see movement

929
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:41,740
from three degrees of freedom headsets

930
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,600
that moves away and we are we have not a

931
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:46,060
lot of six degrees of freedom headsets

932
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,069
and I like that really much also the

933
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:51,040
finger tracking stuff that we really

934
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:55,510
need is progressing really really fast

935
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:59,140
I saw Neos VR as has good good finger

936
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:02,590
tracking right now so I'm glad for that

937
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:04,779
and yeah on the software side there was

938
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:08,140
not that much limitations when you when

939
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:10,360
you develop on good platforms but when

940
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:13,210
you when you choose a platform like like

941
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,130
the web and when you imagine going

942
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:20,020
through the hell we did we'd go through

943
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:24,310
with the web BR api's yeah it was really

944
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:25,750
really pain in s-sometimes ready III

945
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:30,100
don't think so there will be a lot of

946
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:32,260
limitations with the software okay time

947
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:34,779
is running very fast so question from

948
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,860
the public yep I don't know if you're

949
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:41,800
rising the

950
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:43,960
okay cool so I sing from from my

951
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,720
perspective it's only question of time

952
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,460
until time and success until the

953
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,859
regulator's maybe will knock on your

954
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,680
door asking for okay bye see implement

955
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:55,720
law restrictions I would like to know if

956
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,520
you have strategies already and how do

957
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,629
they look like - to protect the

958
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:03,550
communities from these actions at least

959
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:06,610
in our case we of course we think about

960
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:07,900
this but from the very beginning like it

961
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:09,340
take what it will take time until the

962
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,980
regulator's will come and start knocking

963
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:14,140
on the doors in in a big way but we

964
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,970
designed somnom economy some new world

965
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:19,060
in a very decentralized way what we try

966
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:21,549
to do the best we can so let's say when

967
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,650
we say you can sell things with your own

968
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,480
in somnom we don't say that you will

969
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:27,670
sell those things for example only

970
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,520
through our platform you can go and

971
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,260
place to any NFT open market like open

972
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,720
sea or non funds evils that come

973
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,700
whatever and independently so if people

974
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,799
will be selling their something they

975
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,910
created somewhere else if it occurred

976
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,620
it's like you know try to block

977
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:43,450
blockchain you know go with the tank to

978
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:45,390
blockchain where so it's exactly the

979
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:47,859
same so we will give them the platform

980
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:49,330
but all the creations all the trading

981
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,130
will be happening somewhere in the

982
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:53,770
centralized platforms how would we be

983
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,600
able to stop it impossible yeah so

984
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,340
that's kind of how we approach this and

985
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,440
of course there are some limitations to

986
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,110
this but if you do it in the right way

987
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,730
fundamentally from the very beginning

988
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,620
it's all doable and I really believe in

989
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:08,530
that so that's why we're approach it in

990
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,990
a way we do in case of Neos I think it's

991
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:15,100
it's quite similar we are a decent-sized

992
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:17,259
software so it works without our occult

993
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,420
infrastructure which is definitely that

994
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:23,410
like the weak point of this enjoy the

995
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:24,670
descent relation in our case and that's

996
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:27,250
actually why we introduced the

997
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:30,010
cryptocurrency which is decentralized so

998
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:32,700
so mana monetization or economics

999
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:37,030
wouldn't be wouldn't hinge on this

1000
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:39,399
centralized aspect yeah and I think you

1001
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:41,830
know we will try to make new us even

1002
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,800
more usable without our infrastructure

1003
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:47,940
in a decentralized way

1004
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,940
yeah and continue in this direction

1005
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:56,620
not ever maybe last question here hi um

1006
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,470
I was wondering if what you guys thought

1007
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:02,560
about the issues or possible issues of

1008
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:04,390
an entity buying up a whole lot of land

1009
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,820
and just holding it and doing nothing

1010
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,859
with it and and if there's like any kind

1011
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:12,040
of decay mechanisms or how you guys do

1012
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,450
it with governance and also um what

1013
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,850
about the same thing do you

1014
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,890
what about like one Metaverse attacking

1015
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,750
another Metaverse through Sibyl attack

1016
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:21,790
and a scorched earth policy and just

1017
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:25,210
like buying up all the land and making

1018
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:27,700
black spaces and things like that as I

1019
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,080
start sorry because I got this question

1020
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:32,620
a lot in the last days before our

1021
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:34,330
auction you know the economy is a

1022
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,170
beautiful thing if you if you live

1023
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:40,480
economy do its job and not regulate

1024
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:43,330
maybe you know it works very well and in

1025
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,800
that case the land has a value when

1026
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,330
something interesting is built on that

1027
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,540
land right

1028
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:51,910
if someone's buying a lot of land

1029
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:53,259
speculator let's say if buys he's buying

1030
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,480
over land and doing nothing with this

1031
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,190
land nobody will go there it would be an

1032
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,140
empty place everybody else will go to

1033
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:01,030
some other experiences on the other part

1034
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,160
of the map and that price of that land

1035
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:05,950
will grow while this price of this land

1036
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,690
will fall so that is you know

1037
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,730
self-sustaining thing so if you want to

1038
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,170
earn something you better either built

1039
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:13,300
on that land something interesting or

1040
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:14,740
you maybe rent to someone else who will

1041
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,500
build something interesting but without

1042
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,720
doing anything your land will probably

1043
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,150
die great over the time and you will not

1044
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,620
earn your desired speculative profits so

1045
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,670
I think the market will regulate itself

1046
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,650
but of course we're thinking about

1047
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:29,170
different ways how we can encourage

1048
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:31,390
people to build but those ways are more

1049
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,250
or less known intrusive ways in in in in

1050
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:35,560
general you know because we want to you

1051
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:37,960
know stay the decentralized world and we

1052
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:42,250
will stay and yeah so but I think market

1053
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:45,310
will regret itself in our case we don't

1054
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:47,710
sell properties ourselves but but we

1055
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:51,400
want for our world creators to be able

1056
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:54,280
to protect their world or work so the

1057
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,920
words are persistent so if you may

1058
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,870
changes the changes stay but actually

1059
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,170
that the world creates their can reload

1060
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:08,279
some earlier version of the world

1061
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:12,760
no just name for this one : so okay so

1062
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:15,940
