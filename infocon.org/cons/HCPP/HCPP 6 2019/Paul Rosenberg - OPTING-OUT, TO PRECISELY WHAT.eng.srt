00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:32,090
I would like to welcome you to this talk

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:34,150
and our guest now is Paula Rosenberg

5
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:40,420
he's been speaking at this conference

6
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:46,750
for every year I guess since it started

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:51,590
okay since 2015 he's an author of

8
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,900
several books our very favorite one

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,530
which we read before we started this

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:01,989
place is a logic of wavering men where

11
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:04,400
he describes among other things

12
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:07,929
decentralized currencies and

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,640
decentralized markets that was before

14
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,760
invention of Bitcoin so it's very

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,970
visionary book and it was very

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:22,790
interesting read for us

17
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:25,340
he also wrote other books like breaking

18
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:29,540
down which is one of the latest ones I

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:33,680
think you wrote a newer one about time

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:38,120
travel sort of thing he's also an author

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:43,520
of newsletter which is now called

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:46,010
parallel society and I'm subscriber and

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,130
very happy readers so when it arrives in

24
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:51,950
my mailbox I'm really happy and it's

25
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:58,310
usually the first thing that I read so

26
00:01:51,950 --> 00:02:00,530
now he will talk about what we are here

27
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,110
for the topic of this conference is

28
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,070
opt-out and it's also the topic of

29
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,980
Paul's talk

30
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:16,029
so please welcome Paul Rosenberg

31
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:16,029
[Applause]

32
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,470
better now I can hear it too alright

33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,810
let's talk about opting out

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,530
we all have reasons to opt out to try to

35
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,350
get away from oppression from problems

36
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:15,180
from things that are imposing upon us in

37
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:18,750
our life but one of the problems with it

38
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,540
is we're opting out from and we need to

39
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,660
know or to develop what we're opting out

40
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,540
to it's to come to run away from

41
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:31,320
something is fine it's necessary to run

42
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,910
to something is better and this is what

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:40,500
I think is the thing we need to do now

44
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:43,109
we need to have a vision of where we're

45
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,150
going to go so we have some idea where

46
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,880
we're going and if you notice we all do

47
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,700
this once we decide upon something we

48
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,070
decide it might be the best thing to do

49
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,369
we tell stories to ourselves about how

50
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,570
this works what is the story about

51
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,700
cryptocurrency what are the things we

52
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,650
tell ourselves we replay in our mind

53
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,540
about it humans always do this we tell

54
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,760
ourselves stories and we need to have

55
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:12,060
visions of where we're opting out -

56
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,880
where are we going what is it look like

57
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,890
on the other side so this is really

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,168
important humans are what we tend to

59
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,930
call teleological really fancy word that

60
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:23,909
the academics fight about but what it

61
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,810
means is if I want to go have my glass

62
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,300
of water

63
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,030
I don't think okay lift up this leg a

64
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,090
little bit lean this way do this turn

65
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,340
and go across here I don't think of

66
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,239
those things I just say I want my water

67
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:42,989
go and we operate that way mentally as

68
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,630
well as physically and it's really it's

69
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,419
much much better for us to have a vision

70
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,150
of where we're going and then go for it

71
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,799
it's natural to us it works well for us

72
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,270
and to say well I've got to make step a

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,880
and I've got to make step B and I've got

74
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,280
to make step C it's

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,190
more organic for us to see where we're

76
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,190
going and right now for those of us who

77
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,410
have opted out to whatever extent we

78
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,460
haven't developed our visions yet at

79
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:13,130
least not not well enough in my opinion

80
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:15,440
we have certain things we have I like

81
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,360
you know the guilded refugee you know

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,480
Bitcoin goes to the moon and I'm gonna

83
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,240
fly around on a jet and stay in really

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,430
nice at hotels and I'm gonna be awesome

85
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,230
well you know there's nothing wrong with

86
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,000
flying around in a jet if you can do it

87
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:32,570
and there's you know hopefully Bitcoin

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,040
goes to gazillion dollars and this

89
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,240
dollars become obsolete eventually but

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,740
you know we have to have a vision of

91
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,990
what kind of life we want there's

92
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,640
nothing wrong with this it's probably

93
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,190
not going to be terribly satisfying

94
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,370
after the first couple of weeks it'll be

95
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,410
a fun couple of weeks though right but

96
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,240
this is one of the models that we kind

97
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:57,230
of have is if some of the stories we

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,470
tell ourselves another one is the

99
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,840
tropical island right beyond the eye on

100
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,840
the beach tapping on your laptop and

101
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,739
making money man that's pretty sweet and

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:13,280
it is sweet it's a nice thing to do it

103
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,830
doesn't age very well is people who have

104
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,229
tried it will tell you it's really cool

105
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,590
that first week but it doesn't you know

106
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,420
it doesn't really age very well it's

107
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,070
fine and there's nothing wrong with it

108
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,220
if this is what you really want to do

109
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,270
cool do it do it for 50 years if you

110
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,610
want not a problem

111
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,190
nothing wrong with it but it's just one

112
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:37,070
model and we have this one we have a

113
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:40,790
little bit of the mysterious tycoon you

114
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,870
know we've got that too you know bitcoin

115
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,810
is gonna go to the moon and I'm gonna

116
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,090
set up a new whatever and I'm gonna be

117
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,090
you know except do you really want to be

118
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,590
a tycoon well I don't know maybe some of

119
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,679
us do and there's nothing wrong with it

120
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,270
it's a fine choice we have this we have

121
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,120
another one we got the end of the exotic

122
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,979
aunt or uncle you know traveling the

123
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,900
world and doing an interesting here's a

124
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,260
picture of uncle Jimmy's at the pyramids

125
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,630
this year okay which again there's

126
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,760
nothing wrong with it it's fine if

127
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,690
that's what turns

128
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,280
you on god bless go to the pyramids you

129
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,260
know I have a subscriber to my

130
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,409
newsletter who you know who did that for

131
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,550
a few years and told me about it you

132
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,890
know and it actually worked in the

133
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,160
pyramid transcribing hieroglyphics

134
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:30,099
you know it's really interesting so it's

135
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,020
nothing wrong with it what we haven't

136
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,280
built yet or at least have not haven't

137
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:39,250
built very thoroughly is this and this

138
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,950
is what most humans really kind of want

139
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,970
you don't have to do it there's no

140
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:49,060
reason you have to do to live this way

141
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:54,490
but after a lot of years of observing

142
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:57,190
humans I can tell you that most people

143
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,680
are happier in this type of setting and

144
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,830
are more productive in this kind of

145
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,170
setting than in others now again maybe

146
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,419
that's not you it's a significant

147
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,250
percentage of us but maybe it's not you

148
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:13,000
you don't have to do this I'm not saying

149
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:15,420
anybody needs to do it but for most of

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,490
us it's it's a better more productive

151
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,570
setting everybody's family's a little

152
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,040
crazy right

153
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:27,490
we know this okay that's fine we're not

154
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,580
talking about perfections here I just

155
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,990
hurt him by saying that haha

156
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,579
but everybody's family's a little nuts

157
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,490
so we're not perfect expecting any

158
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,720
perfection here but for most people in

159
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:42,669
most situations this is really a more

160
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,250
productive way of life for all of its

161
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,520
problems it provides a really nice base

162
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:51,550
for most of us and there's a lot there's

163
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:55,530
a lot of beauty to it so I think this is

164
00:08:51,550 --> 00:09:00,579
something that we need to take seriously

165
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:03,130
and to think about this model when we're

166
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:07,900
going outside we want to build something

167
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:12,220
outside that makes this possible it's

168
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:15,130
important yeah but wait tradition is bad

169
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,400
isn't it and you know I totally

170
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:22,240
understand torching tradition I get it

171
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,660
I used to be that guy I understand

172
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,060
torching tradition

173
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,480
tradition can be a weapon it can be a

174
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:33,979
bludgeon that hits you with that you get

175
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,720
hit with rather so I understand that but

176
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,230
here's the thing we should never take

177
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,020
any tradition whole but if you take the

178
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,450
pieces out of it there are always some

179
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,280
good pieces inside of just about every

180
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,470
tradition you can find you think of

181
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,130
traditional ideas you go sit like well

182
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:54,470
don't kill don't steal take a special

183
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,870
care for little kids and old people and

184
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,450
pregnant ladies and clean up the mess

185
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,190
that you made and those are all very

186
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,460
traditional ideas we don't want to give

187
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:07,220
those up so every tradition has some

188
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:10,310
things in it that are useful because

189
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,730
something is traditional is not a reason

190
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:16,040
to toss it away examine it find the

191
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:19,130
parts of it that are good take those

192
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,430
parts and the parts that aren't useful

193
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:24,200
for you leave them alone maybe they're

194
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:27,530
useful for that guy over there and not

195
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,840
useful for you who knows but this is we

196
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,520
need to look at them and not reject

197
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,260
things because they're traditional and

198
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,680
not accepting because they're

199
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,800
traditional both are most tradition has

200
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,250
things that are valid so it's important

201
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,420
not to go too far on that now this is

202
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:49,160
really important I'm going to spend a

203
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:51,680
little time on this there's been a

204
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,680
divide and conquer game kind of played

205
00:10:51,680 --> 00:11:01,219
upon us and I speak us I mean those of

206
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:02,810
us of the Western civilization over the

207
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,570
last few centuries and that is not

208
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,069
dividing us by the basis of you know the

209
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,450
people who speak our language here and

210
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,480
those evil people who speak a different

211
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,550
language on the other side of the hill

212
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:18,040
but dividing us by generations by time

213
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,040
we've lost connection with our ancestors

214
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:27,469
for whatever troubles they had whatever

215
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,340
difficulties they had our ancestors were

216
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,520
not idiots

217
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:34,600
I used this picture because what they

218
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,410
built was a Christian capitalist

219
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,300
civilization now that's

220
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,000
complicated you have four hours of

221
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,449
history to explain properly exactly what

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,759
I mean

223
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:48,449
by Christian and capitalist I do not

224
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:50,990
mean the gigantic church out of Rome and

225
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:54,269
I do not mean state capitalism I mean

226
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:58,439
Christianity proper and capitalism

227
00:11:54,269 --> 00:12:02,310
proper free-market economics these

228
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:04,980
people built it and and the last few

229
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:08,459
centuries all of their flaws have been

230
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:11,699
amplified and made much bigger than they

231
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:16,680
were and their virtues have been wiped

232
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:19,079
off wiped out of history what I want you

233
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,769
to understand is that the European

234
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:26,279
civilization that was had some very

235
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:30,389
important very humane benevolent aspects

236
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:32,639
to it European in Europe let's take the

237
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:36,000
worst the worst examples of being the

238
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,980
the church when it was the church and a

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,310
lot of crazy ideas were coming out of

240
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,100
Rome sure bad stuff

241
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:47,939
a lot of bad stuff but almost every town

242
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:51,420
in Europe had a priest a nun a monk or

243
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:54,360
somebody who was a good and caring human

244
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,219
being who looked out for the poor who

245
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,290
watched out for the for the kid who was

246
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,970
going over the edge who took care of the

247
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,430
young parents who were struggling with

248
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:05,880
their children who watched out for him

249
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,160
Europeans saw goodness in the world they

250
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,360
knew it existed they expected it to

251
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:16,019
exist this was important and if they had

252
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:19,319
errors which duh they did because we

253
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:22,470
still do if they had errors the job was

254
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:24,779
not to toss them away but to repair the

255
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,839
errors they were you know deeper

256
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,279
darkness than we and then we are we find

257
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,410
ourselves in a better position than

258
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,120
where they were but somehow they

259
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,779
struggle forward and guess what it was

260
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:40,110
they who brought us to where we are now

261
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:44,279
so it's really very important to to not

262
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:46,199
get so so separated from our ancestors

263
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,120
they they can't they brought us a long

264
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:49,500
way and they deserve credit for it and I

265
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,550
want to tell you something that's even

266
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,650
bigger than

267
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:59,120
this is that the European civilization

268
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:01,920
that formed in the wake of Rome as Rome

269
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,060
didn't really fall the way people say it

270
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:10,199
kind of you know dissolved as Rome

271
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:14,459
dissolved they left behind 20 or 30

272
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:17,340
million slaves Europe was covered with

273
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,350
slavery it was the economic system of

274
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,640
the Roman Empire and pretty much all

275
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:26,330
three everything else in the old days

276
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:29,340
within a few centuries the European

277
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,960
civilization of five hundred six hundred

278
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,500
seven hundred eight hundred nine hundred

279
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:37,200
a thousand ad killed slavery is the

280
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,910
first time in recorded history that

281
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,700
slavery was destroyed on a

282
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:44,969
civilizational scale never happened

283
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,430
before these people did it they get

284
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,070
credit for doing that did they do it

285
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,560
perfectly and pristinely no they didn't

286
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,020
but they did it and then when it sprang

287
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,900
up on the North American continent some

288
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:01,860
centuries later as soon as as soon as

289
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:04,280
enough European Christians got to the

290
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,990
new world they killed slavery there too

291
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,089
that's how it actually happened see

292
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,100
there's a huge gap slavery is gone from

293
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,870
Europe at a thousand AD but all sudden

294
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,280
it pops back up in North America that's

295
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,140
because there weren't any Europeans

296
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,170
there at the time the slavers got there

297
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,569
the slavers and their backers got there

298
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:24,180
and started abusing the people there but

299
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,870
as soon as enough European Christians

300
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,790
got there it was wiped out now this is

301
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,010
not to say that Christianity is a

302
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,760
perfect thing or that Europeans are

303
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,560
ideal human beings you know our guys are

304
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,420
idiots just like everybody else's guys

305
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,910
they have some idiots and we make

306
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,099
mistakes and do stupid things do but

307
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,610
they did this and is the first time it

308
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,140
ever happened and they did it twice and

309
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,420
one of the great errors of history that

310
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,630
I will fix it to whatever extent I'm

311
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,270
able to do it as these people get credit

312
00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:00,510
for this and they did it

313
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:03,150
by creating an economic system that

314
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,990
replaced slavery see slavery was about

315
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,079
it

316
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,910
a means of gathering surplus so if you

317
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,130
needed money to buy to build a new

318
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,459
granary if needed money to build a new

319
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,649
well if you needed whatever you got your

320
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:18,719
surplus from your slaves it's a really

321
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:21,360
good way of getting surplus you get a

322
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,160
lot of surplus real fast you know you

323
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,990
have to enslave other human beings in

324
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,890
the process so I don't recommend it but

325
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:31,170
it really worked and these people got

326
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,790
rid of it for moral reasons and then

327
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,189
they had to develop some other way of

328
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,500
gaining surplus right because you got to

329
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,240
build a barn sometimes and you have to

330
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,459
dig a ditch and you have to you know

331
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,750
build your irrigation system so they

332
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:48,390
learned how to create surplus by being

333
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,000
clever by finding new ways of do things

334
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,010
of additive adapting of finding new ways

335
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,260
to make things so you can get a little

336
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:58,230
of a profit margin in there which is

337
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,959
your surplus and it's hard it's harder

338
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,120
than slavery it's easier with slavery to

339
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,879
generate a surplus than it is with

340
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,569
capitalism in most places in most cases

341
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,550
I should say so but these people didn't

342
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,290
do it because they wouldn't do it and

343
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,409
they created a system that brought us to

344
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:18,149
where we are so to me this is if you

345
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,290
know if your while I was gonna say if

346
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,329
you remember nothing else but there's

347
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,970
one other thing you have to remember

348
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:26,339
well get there now the parallel model

349
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,490
that we want to build on the outside

350
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:31,770
that's a that encompasses a much wider

351
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,410
group of people than just the guilded

352
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:37,290
refugee and so on is really the model of

353
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:41,130
the synagogue when you think about it I

354
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:45,480
don't mean necessarily religiously but

355
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,770
the synagogue began then roughly 500 BC

356
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,740
its complex story

357
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:52,379
the entire or not the entire but most of

358
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,780
the nation of Judea was taken away to

359
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,429
Babylon and for the first time they had

360
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,330
to separate their religion their

361
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:01,860
ideology from their geography and this

362
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,659
was a new thing it hadn't really been

363
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,250
done before I mean must be some little

364
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,290
case that I'm missing but it really

365
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,290
hadn't been done so they had had

366
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,570
separate what they believed with where

367
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,540
they lived and they created a portable

368
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,700
culture and again it's all complicated

369
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:21,570
and didn't take its final form to like

370
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,940
140 or 280 whatever they created this

371
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,980
parallel culture I want you to

372
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,080
understand something during this period

373
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,909
of time the Greeks came and went the

374
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:37,080
Romans came and went the Persians assign

375
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:41,399
acids the you name them Charlemagne and

376
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:44,279
everything else all came all gone the

377
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:48,239
parallel culture remains through some

378
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:50,760
really harsh circumstances and it

379
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,130
remains this is a really interesting

380
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,230
model for us if we want to build

381
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,630
something outside something parallel

382
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,370
something different I think there are

383
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,639
things to learn here because this thing

384
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:06,360
has survived and has done reasonably

385
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:10,070
well all these years let me give you

386
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,029
some basics of how this portable

387
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,939
civilization worked and you know these

388
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:17,490
are the old the old Jewish traditions

389
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,260
but again it's 2,000 years and and

390
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,480
they're still here so there might be

391
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,010
something to learn here anytime there

392
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,029
was a community where there were ten

393
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:28,889
adult males within commuting distance so

394
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:30,690
they could know each other they had to

395
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:33,059
form a community this was expected of

396
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,470
them if there's humming oh yeah you're

397
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,970
living over there how many people are

398
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,860
there over there how many Jews are there

399
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,210
over there oh we got so-and-so oh you

400
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,699
got 12 well you can form the community

401
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:45,000
now and if you didn't yet have kind of a

402
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,010
reason why not and this was expected so

403
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,440
you had a form of community as soon as a

404
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,929
hundred and twenty were living in the

405
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,429
same area how to build a school or open

406
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,820
a school or something you had to have

407
00:19:53,429 --> 00:20:00,090
your own school and you had to also have

408
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:03,029
a court for moderating disputes between

409
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,620
each other you had to have some way of

410
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:07,169
doing it because this was necessary for

411
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,840
it to keep this culture going you also

412
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:11,460
had to create a school and not only

413
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,399
create a school but you had to provide

414
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,899
free school if there are orphans or if

415
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:17,459
they're poor people who can't afford it

416
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:20,760
they go anyway

417
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,919
you who can afford to keep us to pay

418
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,950
your dues or however you arrange it you

419
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:29,760
have to do it you must take care of your

420
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,260
own poor I was that was part of the deal

421
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,980
they had a

422
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,629
themselves and you had to watch out for

423
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,660
each other because you were alone you

424
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,940
weren't part of the mainline culture you

425
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,440
may whether or not you were persecuted

426
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,320
sometimes they were sometimes they

427
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,390
weren't you had to take care of yourself

428
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,730
so in the early days one of the big

429
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,440
risks was being enslaved you know you're

430
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,960
out on your boat trading with the next

431
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,630
town over and some some pirates come

432
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,820
through and you know all of a sudden

433
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,370
your uncle is in slave somewhere well

434
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,530
the job of the community where he's from

435
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,540
was to put together your money and buy

436
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:09,059
him back out of slavery you got seven

437
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:12,030
years get the guy out of slavery if not

438
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:14,340
why not why didn't you do it it was

439
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:19,740
necessary so these are the type of

440
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:22,470
things that and enabled this to survive

441
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,720
all these other empires and to continue

442
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,330
for whatever problems they had you know

443
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,370
there's stupid guys of every flavor and

444
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,590
difficult human difficulties all the

445
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:36,270
time everywhere but it worked and it

446
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:38,040
still exists in Christianity in the

447
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,750
beginning was the same way you can

448
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,710
remember Christianity though that we

449
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:46,110
know was founded by essentially a rabbi

450
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,870
Saul of Tarsus whom most people know as

451
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,639
st. Paul he was a Pharisee and these

452
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:56,629
guys are the ones that became the rabbis

453
00:21:50,640 --> 00:22:01,559
so it was built along a Jewish model and

454
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:03,960
the ecclesia the church that Paul taught

455
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:06,720
people to set up was essentially a

456
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,280
synagogue as little variances and little

457
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,559
differences but it was essentially the

458
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,020
synagogue model and this is the Roman

459
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,750
Emperor Julian who hated Christians I

460
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,600
mean this guy really did not like me

461
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,710
call them atheists and a lot of Roman

462
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,699
sit at the time they were atheist

463
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,679
because they didn't worship the gods

464
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,850
right

465
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,160
they had this other thing that they did

466
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,840
so they called him atheist anyhow says

467
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,929
it is a scandal that there's not a

468
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,939
single Jew who's a beggar and that these

469
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:35,910
godless Galileans those are the

470
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,890
Christians these godless Galileans don't

471
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,440
only care not only for their own but

472
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,880
they take care of our guys as well so

473
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,790
they're not only doing like the Jews or

474
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,520
even going further okay so

475
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:52,320
gianna t was the same model in just for

476
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,389
fun up until all at least 400 and 400

477
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,000
and some ad Christians attended

478
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:59,130
synagogue not all of them but a lot of

479
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,200
them did and we know this because a very

480
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,840
very famous preacher of the time named

481
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,210
John Chrysostom we still have we have

482
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,669
copies of these sermons that he preached

483
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,210
telling all the Christians they should

484
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:14,190
not they should stop going to synagogues

485
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:17,130
because now they're not the same and you

486
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:20,130
can't go there you have to go here we

487
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,660
know I mean there's 4 5 6 sermons we

488
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,080
have from this guy and he was a big guy

489
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:28,740
he was the archbishop of Constantinople

490
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:33,330
or Bishop of Constantinople in those

491
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:37,320
days so the Christian Christianity was

492
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:41,520
the same at the beginning anyway so

493
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:43,679
here's our question you know right now

494
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,830
we're already setting up new communities

495
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,870
aren't we all right I don't know if if

496
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,520
parallel Pulis has been used to settle

497
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:56,429
disputes but I'll bet that it hasn't to

498
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:59,220
some level now there are a lot of young

499
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,840
people in the audience here and you know

500
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,420
one of the characteristics of young

501
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,830
people all through the years is if you

502
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,570
leave them alone they kind of tend to

503
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:09,750
pair off and pretty soon they're having

504
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:12,060
kids so all of a sudden if we've got a

505
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:16,170
bunch of kids around here do we need to

506
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:20,490
start our own school yeah you know maybe

507
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:22,170
we do so then pretty soon plus you know

508
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:25,110
the Jews had their particular ideology

509
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,820
we've got an ideology - we've got some

510
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:30,600
pretty strong feelings about our ideas

511
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:33,270
as well so at what point are we doing

512
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,860
the same thing you know I can argue

513
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,240
about definitions but you know at some

514
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:40,110
point we're doing the same thing and

515
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,300
it's a good model forget about the

516
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,879
religious aspect it's a good model of

517
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,860
organization and it's something at least

518
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,140
I think we should keep in mind and

519
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,240
learned from because these guys about

520
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,030
2,000 years to work through a lot of a

521
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,410
lot of the mistakes we don't want to

522
00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:00,080
repeat all that all right

523
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:02,690
so here we are I love this picture but

524
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,810
here we are we're on the outside you

525
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:08,990
know what do we build well there's all

526
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:12,800
sorts of ideas I'm going to give you a

527
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:15,410
few of my own kind of over all sorts of

528
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,919
ideas just something to keep to keep in

529
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:20,870
the tank and think about first we want

530
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,710
to build systems that are geared for our

531
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:27,469
abilities not for our fears if you look

532
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:30,980
at the national systems that surround

533
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:34,760
you and especially with all of the you

534
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:40,120
know 24/7 what a new systems I call them

535
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,920
fear delivery systems all these things a

536
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,270
huge portion of modern life is built

537
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,260
around what we're afraid of

538
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,550
or what many people are afraid of I

539
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,700
don't want to build on things I'm afraid

540
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,680
of yeah ok if there's some danger ok you

541
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,960
know some maniac comes down your your

542
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,970
street you know burning houses then you

543
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,150
got to do something ok yeah it sucks but

544
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:05,120
how often does that really happen to us

545
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,800
not much I don't want to build based on

546
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,219
our fears I want to build something

547
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:13,190
that's geared for our abilities that

548
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:15,530
give us a chance to use what we have in

549
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,940
us not something that's just oh we're

550
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,200
afraid this could happen and this could

551
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,780
happen and this might happen in this

552
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,000
good at well you can do that forever

553
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:25,190
imaginary fears are infinite if you took

554
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,900
this group and said okay everyone here's

555
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,940
a here's here's a pencil and a piece of

556
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,550
paper let's start writing down things we

557
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,890
might possibly be afraid of we'd be here

558
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:36,590
for weeks because you can just do that

559
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,480
okay so imaginary fears are infinite I

560
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,699
don't want to build based upon fear fear

561
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,710
makes humans stupid we don't want to do

562
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:47,750
that I want to build with things that

563
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:50,240
are geared for our abilities I want to

564
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,760
put the human consciousness above rules

565
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,670
this is a ha this is a concept that

566
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,740
takes a little getting used to I write

567
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,010
about it in the newsletter I think it's

568
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:04,310
a really important point rules our

569
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:10,100
binary displacements of analysis in

570
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:13,100
consciousness yes no on off in out

571
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,320
this is the rule it's the law sir you

572
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:19,490
can't think about it it's what it is so

573
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:23,210
there are real problem with rules it's a

574
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:26,240
long involved subject but I would ask

575
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:29,780
you really to keep it in mind because

576
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,730
rules by themselves are not really our

577
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,720
friend we've always been taught to think

578
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,559
of it that way

579
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,230
and look we've been raised with a

580
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:42,080
mechanized a mechanical view of the

581
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,600
universe Isaac Newton the orbits of the

582
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,250
planet Kepler and all this stuff we can

583
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,090
do it with math we know how everything

584
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:52,700
works that mechanized view is really

585
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,949
good for science it's really good for

586
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,160
you know tech and whatever else but it's

587
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:00,830
not particularly good for us so I want

588
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,110
to put consciousness above rules and

589
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,939
again it's a long subject but keep it in

590
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,969
mind if you're interested there's stuff

591
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,240
in my newsletter about it I want to get

592
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,410
rid of status again this is a concept

593
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,960
that people have a hard time with

594
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,780
sometimes because we've all grown up

595
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,940
with status but status by its very

596
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:24,830
nature is divisive and conflict

597
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:29,150
generating status depending on whose

598
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:33,050
definition you use is a recognition of

599
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:36,140
my standing versus your standing that's

600
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:39,110
what it is that's its definition my

601
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:41,570
standing versus your standing Oh who's

602
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:43,870
better who's higher in the status

603
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:48,580
ranking me are you

604
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:51,800
this can cause nothing but conflict and

605
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,449
division between people it's a bad

606
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,669
concept first of all it's just

607
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,540
ridiculous because we are very

608
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:01,760
complicated beings you may have more

609
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,220
money than me I may be more healthy than

610
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,410
you you may be better languages I may be

611
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,300
better at math were different in a

612
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,960
thousand ways from each other and to

613
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:16,220
just put one tag status high-low is

614
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,780
stupid and it harms us so again this is

615
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,000
just one of these ideas to keep in the

616
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,170
back of your head it takes time to get

617
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,180
used to but I really think it's

618
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:25,480
important

619
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,650
this is a big deal this is the other

620
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:32,380
thing that if you know if you remember

621
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:36,400
nothing else remember remember this we

622
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:39,910
have to accept that good things can grow

623
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,310
within us this is a quote from Carl Jung

624
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:45,520
and he says people who'll do anything no

625
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:48,760
matter how absurd in order to fate avoid

626
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,860
facing their souls they'll do all manner

627
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,200
of rigorous and mystical things because

628
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,000
they have not the slightest faith that

629
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,460
anything good can come out of their own

630
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,350
soul again the model for us for science

631
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:07,060
mechanical model is of looking at things

632
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:11,980
that's fine it's appropriate for us the

633
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:15,360
model is organic seeds growth bearing

634
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:18,460
fruit so on those are the models for us

635
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,550
they work much better for us and the

636
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:24,940
truth is that the Great and the good can

637
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:26,919
grow in us we've been taught so often to

638
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,150
think that oh you know we have to be

639
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,640
careful we're right on the edge of

640
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:32,980
breaking in the law or breaking a

641
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,690
commandment and then if we do something

642
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,490
wrong all that cancels everything else

643
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,790
we already did know it's a wrong model

644
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:44,950
it's bad for us and good things can grow

645
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:47,950
out of us the great opportunity that

646
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:52,390
stands before us with going out opting

647
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:54,520
out being outside as we can build places

648
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,380
where we can function that way the great

649
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,190
the great passage on this was from

650
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:04,570
Abraham Maslow a very famous are

651
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:06,460
unjustly noted psychologist he and he

652
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,310
said I wish I had the quote in front of

653
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,410
me but I don't but it's very close to

654
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:16,419
children have peak experiences all the

655
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:20,430
time but one but the school systems of

656
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:24,250
the present world are uniquely designed

657
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:26,950
to stop it and to keep them from having

658
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:30,100
peak experiences and to prevent peak

659
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:32,200
experiences so the systems of the world

660
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:35,949
of the national state systems are

661
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,690
designed against the better

662
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,780
functions of human nature and they have

663
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:42,790
to be understand if people were not

664
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:46,030
intimidated people were not afraid if

665
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:48,580
people were not confused they don't they

666
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:51,280
wouldn't obey very well if you want

667
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,230
humans to obey without thinking they

668
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,879
have to be a little bit afraid they have

669
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:58,300
to be kind of intimidated they have to

670
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,360
be kind of confused and not trust their

671
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,580
own minds not learn how to trust their

672
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,949
own minds otherwise they don't if they

673
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,120
do they don't obey very well and if

674
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,940
you're running a system that requires

675
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,030
obedience you need people to be that way

676
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,800
so we haven't believed this but we do

677
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:21,070
need to believe this that great things

678
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:24,070
can grow out of us and it's true so what

679
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:26,790
we need are transcending goals making

680
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:30,220
money is fine making money is necessary

681
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:34,389
all these things matter but we need

682
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:37,120
something to really operate well we need

683
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,680
something that's magnificent something

684
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,250
that's majestic something that's

685
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,870
wonderful to work for if it's just money

686
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,220
okay and especially when you don't have

687
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,159
any that matters a lot

688
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:50,140
but you want to really build something

689
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,520
great you have to have a majestic goal

690
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,760
yeah if they have something that's

691
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,590
inspiring here's I'll give you a few

692
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,110
we're running a little low on time so

693
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:01,990
I'll give you a few eliminating scarcity

694
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:04,659
we now know we have the information in

695
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,820
our libraries on the Internet we have

696
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,470
all the information we had we need and

697
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,659
it's been tried and tested a hundred

698
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:14,350
times to feed every person on the planet

699
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:18,220
well we have enough information to build

700
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:20,290
cars and houses and roads and whatever

701
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,530
else we need for every person on the

702
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:26,710
planet probably times two we know how to

703
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:29,740
do this we don't grow a lot of food

704
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:32,350
because there's no one to buy it there's

705
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:35,530
no one to eat it in the united north

706
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:37,480
america in particular there's a huge gap

707
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:40,270
between what could be grown in what is

708
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,370
grown even grown properly with crop

709
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:45,790
rotation and everything we know how to

710
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:49,030
do this there's no reason anybody should

711
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:50,320
should be deprived of any basic needs on

712
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:54,149
this planet and

713
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:57,668
more and it's been the case for 30 years

714
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:59,649
maybe 40 years it's absolutely been the

715
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:02,019
case we haven't done it because there

716
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:04,959
are bottlenecks but this you want to

717
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:08,649
transcend in goal this is something

718
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,649
human starvation human deprivation lack

719
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:14,679
of basic things we can kill it

720
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:20,290
forever I mean unless an asteroid

721
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:23,980
strikes but you know this is a goal and

722
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:28,409
we know exactly how to do it without

723
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:30,699
question expanding through the universe

724
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:35,169
something I want to do this is a big

725
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:39,069
goal and remember we put 12 men on the

726
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:43,149
moon with 50 and 60 year old technology

727
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:45,429
the first trip to the moon was 1968 the

728
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:48,429
first landing was 69 but the first trip

729
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:50,849
there was 1968 that's a lot of years ago

730
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:53,168
now you think computers and

731
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:54,849
manufacturing technologies and the

732
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:57,759
chemistry for the fuels and everything

733
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:59,710
else it's a whole lot better now than it

734
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,680
was then and it's not that it's just not

735
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:05,560
that hard discovering something figuring

736
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,290
it out the first time that's hard but

737
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,230
after it's been figured out teaching it

738
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:13,359
to the next group of people that's not

739
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,900
so bad

740
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,490
a lot of the formerly third world

741
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,190
nations are getting in on this do you

742
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:25,649
know that India the nation of India has

743
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:32,950
a satellite in orbit of Mars look it up

744
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:35,410
they do it's not that hard anymore this

745
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,750
is standing in front of us it's not that

746
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,819
hard yes it's difficult and yes there

747
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:43,000
will be some loss of life along the way

748
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:46,900
and you know new adventures are are

749
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,900
tough that way well okay but this is

750
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:53,079
doable for us it's not that again they

751
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,670
went with technology from the 1960s to

752
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:57,190
the moon and back safely

753
00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:01,810
several times I've met one or two of the

754
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:03,430
guys who did it it can be done this

755
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:09,460
stands before us

756
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:12,069
here's another one yeah we don't have

757
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:14,759
anymore image of the great soul of the

758
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:18,940
wonderful man and woman who has a rich

759
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:21,309
internal life and you know the wise

760
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,990
person you can talk to or understands

761
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:28,029
things and can explain things to you

762
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:31,419
and this doesn't much exist anymore but

763
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:34,329
it should and I think some of us really

764
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:36,430
need to to work on this I think it's an

765
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:39,670
important thing it's a it's it's a

766
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:43,240
tremendous thing to do I have some like

767
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:45,460
really quick easy way to start doing it

768
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,618
I won't go through all of it because

769
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,200
we're running low on time but you know

770
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:52,450
take your peak experiences take the best

771
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,129
moments of your life when you did your

772
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:57,098
best when you were really working well

773
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:59,559
think about them take time to examine

774
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:01,630
them turn them over in your mind think

775
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:03,789
about how it worked what it worked what

776
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,349
it felt like and keep working with these

777
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:07,720
things oh pretty soon you're gonna start

778
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:09,549
getting more of them pretty soon you're

779
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,999
gonna start becoming a better person and

780
00:37:09,549 --> 00:37:19,269
over time you become the human with a

781
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:22,410
great soul final slide and this is where

782
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:26,589
I really want to get a couple things set

783
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:28,509
we have it in our power us here right

784
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:30,749
now to begin the world over again this

785
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:34,299
quote comes from the American Revolution

786
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:36,399
which was complicated and people

787
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:39,160
described it for their own purposes a

788
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,950
lot of different ways but this was an

789
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:47,859
empty continent were a bunch of people

790
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:49,058
with mostly good ideas decided that they

791
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:51,519
didn't want to live the old way anymore

792
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:53,349
and of course it was very complicated to

793
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:57,160
him and I'm not giving it doing it

794
00:37:53,349 --> 00:38:00,220
justice but they decided this quote is

795
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:02,440
from Thomas Paine in 1776 which is right

796
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,589
at the height of the American Revolution

797
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,470
as I look at it and he said oh my god

798
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:12,038
here we are we have it in our power to

799
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:14,890
begin the world over again and this is

800
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,660
the position we have found ourselves in

801
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:19,868
since

802
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:23,589
really really spraying on the world and

803
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:26,980
it gave us a way to wall off territory

804
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:30,420
and it's mathematics I'm trying to win a

805
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:32,770
fight with mathematics good luck

806
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:37,299
cryptography is just math you can't put

807
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:40,119
a bullet in it so we have cryptography

808
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:43,450
we have amazing technology we have all

809
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:46,630
sorts of things going for us and we have

810
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:51,549
the ability to start the world over

811
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:53,470
again and as I see it opting out yes we

812
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:57,099
opted out from and witness it's a

813
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:58,629
necessity I understand but we also have

814
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:01,180
to think about what we were opting out

815
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:05,140
too and the opportunity that we really

816
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:07,288
have now is to build outside something a

817
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,549
new environment

818
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:12,190
humans create their own environments

819
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:15,730
that were unique that way we create our

820
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:18,549
own environments we have this

821
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:21,460
opportunity on the outside to build an

822
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:24,220
environment where the human thing is the

823
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:27,339
great and good things within us have a

824
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:29,819
chance to thrive have a chance to expand

825
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:32,230
where they're not being held down by

826
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:35,049
impositions and demands and

827
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:38,770
intimidations and fears and we have a

828
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:41,799
chance to really become what humans are

829
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:44,470
supposed to be this we can do and this

830
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:48,060
to me is the opportunity that stands in

831
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:49,109
front of us thank you very much

832
00:39:48,060 --> 00:40:00,080
thank you

833
00:39:49,110 --> 00:40:02,970
[Applause]

834
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,730
thank you very much we have some time

835
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:08,100
for questions so please wait for the

836
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:13,260
microphone and I'll start with the first

837
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:16,500
one a lot of people psychologists say

838
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:19,500
that a lot of what we do unconsciously

839
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:24,780
in human interactions is status

840
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:27,690
signaling and you've been saying that we

841
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,160
should somehow abandon status so my

842
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,740
question is first of all if it's

843
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,950
achievable and if it's the same thing

844
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:39,770
you're talking about so building

845
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:42,960
here--he's or just in relation to just

846
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:49,410
unconscious status signaling and kind of

847
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:51,900
the instinctive way of showing status

848
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:57,060
signaling status yes both are possible

849
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:58,860
both are very clearly possible rather

850
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:04,440
than giving personal examples let me

851
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:09,810
tell you a story about status we

852
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:12,540
obviously are more capable and better if

853
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:15,480
you will than primates than mere

854
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:18,930
primates were primates also but there

855
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,950
was a a researcher who followed a troop

856
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:25,890
of baboons for 1020 years and they had

857
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:27,990
all of the status things these the

858
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,940
larger males or the senior males would

859
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,680
slap around all the young guys and

860
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:36,380
everybody would slap around the females

861
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,910
and it was just you know your nightmare

862
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,530
status situation but this is how be a

863
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:44,100
bouns operate this whole a whole lot of

864
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:46,610
things in the animal kingdom operate and

865
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:50,220
so you know this is just textbook

866
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:55,260
ordering of basic primate civilization

867
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:57,089
until one day there was near where these

868
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:01,500
baboons lived they were putting in a new

869
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:04,140
hotel and somebody threw away some bad

870
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,820
meat because they looked at it this

871
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,879
isn't good throw it away where it can't

872
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,170
feed this to our guests well the

873
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,060
Bowens found it and it was actually

874
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:13,230
tainted at that point I don't know how

875
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,490
this happened but it was tainted with

876
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:20,340
tuberculosis and the baboons found it

877
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:22,919
and all of the males the big males the

878
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,990
older male they slapped the young guys

879
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,330
away say you know get out of here they

880
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:31,859
slapped the females away and they ate

881
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:34,710
the meat they all died so in a matter of

882
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:37,970
a number of days we had a baboon troop

883
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:39,800
with all of the dominance taken away

884
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:43,410
guess what

885
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,180
they were never dominant again the male

886
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:47,609
stopped beating up the younger males

887
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,700
they stop they stop slapping around the

888
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:52,890
females they started grooming each other

889
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:57,779
more which was you know what baboons do

890
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:59,640
and they started taking and the all of

891
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,820
the chemicals which are the same as the

892
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,640
chemicals we have for stress and high

893
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:09,330
blood pressure and all of that goes

894
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,129
along with it went down and it

895
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:14,930
maintained that for at least 10 years

896
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,920
that I know of so if baboons can do this

897
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,169
we can do this too

898
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,180
the problem is we've been trained so

899
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:23,940
long in these ideas we look at the world

900
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:26,730
that way growing up in the factory era

901
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,500
you know what's the difference between

902
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,570
the important person in the unimportant

903
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,210
person the important person our orders

904
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:35,070
other people around right that makes you

905
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,840
an important person you order other

906
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:40,080
people around and if you take orders

907
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,580
well you're just a worker and so we're

908
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:45,210
so used to this model

909
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:50,400
but if baboons can get over it I'm

910
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:56,220
really confident that we can - here we

911
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:58,410
have time for one more question thanks

912
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:02,450
again for the great talk Paul I'm always

913
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:05,580
so you know a lightens up whenever it's

914
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:10,069
so great that you made it again this

915
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:13,380
year and my question is you said that

916
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:16,260
before in a personal talk you said

917
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:18,450
decades you you look at decades if you

918
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,780
think about personal development and in

919
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:22,919
your talk you said also you know

920
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:26,730
five-year plan maybe

921
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,440
two short-sighted and you know bunny

922
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,670
when you think about business they

923
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,830
always ask you like what's your

924
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,720
five-year plan right but you know five

925
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:35,430
years it's really too short-sighted you

926
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,160
said with the synagogue you know look at

927
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:40,140
the centuries it's obviously that's too

928
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,970
much for a human lifetime to see what

929
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:46,620
works and what doesn't

930
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:50,250
but yeah the question is you know you

931
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:53,910
you made fun of the of the technology

932
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:55,410
from the moon from the 60s but if you

933
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,140
look at it in centuries

934
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:58,970
that's this really nothing right right

935
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:03,150
right

936
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:06,930
the question is what what is the

937
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:09,690
possibility you know what can we can we

938
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:11,790
you said look at look at what your peak

939
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,980
experiences where what's the peak

940
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,790
experience of humankind then can we can

941
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,240
we look at this

942
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:21,810
in centuries okay yeah we can look at it

943
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:25,339
in centuries and you know right now we

944
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:28,350
look back to 300 years and we say gee

945
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,910
they were bleeding people if you had an

946
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:33,420
ailment you would you know

947
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:36,240
drip drip blood and a lot of people did

948
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,520
it you know it was stupid it made no

949
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,950
sense but it was what everybody did so

950
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,090
everybody else did it two hundred years

951
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:43,580
from now what are they gonna say about

952
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:47,430
us for certain things

953
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:49,740
uh-hum which they will we are moving

954
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:52,710
forward there's no question of a human

955
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:55,979
humanity is of far less tolerant of

956
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:58,980
cruelty than it used to be even in my

957
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:02,460
lifetime humanity is far less tolerant

958
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:05,280
of cruelty we demand more creativity and

959
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,050
the ability to be creative than we used

960
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,480
to up the people in this room are

961
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:12,120
probably outloud outliers that way but

962
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:16,490
but humanity in general feels that way

963
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:20,730
we are very definitely becoming better

964
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:24,209
fast enough well you know we'd all like

965
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:27,510
it to be faster but there's no question

966
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:32,040
Humanity is getting better and we are

967
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:34,490
going to find amazing things in the

968
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,150
future again once we get into space

969
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,919
everything

970
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:41,160
everything but a whole lot of things

971
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,380
change there that's a whole talk of its

972
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,058
own of all the things that change when

973
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:49,470
humans get in including our bodies by

974
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:52,020
the way when we get out in space is

975
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,490
space going to be a panacea no your

976
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,750
won't it's gonna be problematic and

977
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:56,609
we're gonna bring problems with it

978
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,200
because we're not fully developed yet

979
00:46:56,609 --> 00:47:00,869
either and we carry problems in

980
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,730
ourselves that's the wonderful thing I

981
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:04,099
know I'm getting a little off topic but

982
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:06,809
that's the wonderful thing about having

983
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:09,150
transcendent goals because if you're

984
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:12,690
going after something awesome something

985
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:15,450
awe-inspiring something wonderful then

986
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:18,420
it helps you get past all the little BS

987
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:20,098
problems in our daily lives you know oh

988
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,170
he's doing this and should have done

989
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:24,569
that or she said this and he said that

990
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:27,089
all those little stupid things that

991
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:30,930
people get drawn into if you're focused

992
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:32,730
on this long immense wonderful goal you

993
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:37,020
tend to ignore those things and you

994
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:37,859
produce better okay we have time for one

995
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,829
more question

996
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:46,828
hi thanks very much for your talk I met

997
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:49,680
a lot of notes actually so I've actually

998
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:51,869
always thought of consciousness as one

999
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,839
of these steps to sovereignty and

1000
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:58,559
individualism I think you can agree with

1001
00:47:54,839 --> 00:48:00,839
that yes and as you said there should be

1002
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,700
a proper setting of shared context

1003
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:05,099
shared values this is too much believe

1004
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:08,220
if we actually want to build a society

1005
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:10,200
of conscious people did I understand

1006
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:13,770
correctly that you use to Christianity

1007
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:16,200
Judaism as example of a principle that

1008
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:18,839
we can use in order to build something

1009
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,328
out there to opt out you I think we can

1010
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:24,210
take from there from first of all from

1011
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:27,109
their history to see how they arrange

1012
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:29,640
themselves and how they worked

1013
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:31,680
Christianity makes a beautiful example

1014
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,589
early Christianity I'm talking about the

1015
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:38,490
first few centuries because these people

1016
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:41,849
were inside of a very hostile situation

1017
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:43,049
with the Roman Empire and they just kept

1018
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:45,109
doing what they were doing they were

1019
00:48:43,049 --> 00:48:47,130
Outsiders but they didn't fight Rome

1020
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:49,680
they just were living their own

1021
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,869
different way and separating from it

1022
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,520
and over several centuries the people

1023
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:55,799
who lived with them saw that these are

1024
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,079
decent people they're not crazy they

1025
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:00,990
believe things we don't believe but

1026
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:03,420
they're not terrible and over time Rome

1027
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:09,000
went away and these people remained and

1028
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:10,920
they built the European civilization the

1029
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,650
important thing about Judaism

1030
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:18,539
Christianity are these core values the

1031
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:21,000
applications have stung okay you know if

1032
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:23,220
you if you can take Jesus and take him

1033
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,920
out of everything else just take his

1034
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:30,839
words and take them out i Bremen I wrote

1035
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:35,190
a book about this earlier this year it's

1036
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:36,779
a really good set of ideals I don't

1037
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:39,359
agree with how they've been implemented

1038
00:49:36,779 --> 00:49:41,430
in many cases but the ideals themselves

1039
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,680
the the Jewish concepts the he old

1040
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:49,169
Hebrew concepts of justice above ruler

1041
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:50,788
of we can improve we are able what we do

1042
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:54,720
manners all of these sorts of principles

1043
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:58,400
are essential well actually that was my

1044
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:01,200
question slightly different though okay

1045
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,510
so you're offering to use the system of

1046
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,640
belief which cornerstone is to actually

1047
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:08,220
give up just sovereignty to external God

1048
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:11,609
and to totally surrender to his judgment

1049
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:15,419
as an example of the basic layer of

1050
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:17,880
society of conscious individuals no you

1051
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:20,910
are in you are inserting all sorts of

1052
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,490
interpretations into this set of ideas

1053
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:26,328
that I don't and I don't I don't agree

1054
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:29,520
with those insertions okay cool thanks

1055
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:35,180
okay thank you very much Paul thank you

1056
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,180
for coming here thank you very much

1057
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:43,329
before you leave I just want to let you

1058
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:46,868
know that if you want to see the next

1059
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:48,220
talk of Professor Robin Henson it's also

1060
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:51,450
streamed to the

1061
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:53,980
laverna to the other room so you can

1062
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:56,078
pick a comfortable seat if you are

1063
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:58,109
sitting on the floor and will be back

1064
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,109

1065
