3
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:31,050
I would like to introduce you our first

4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,769
speaker this day I hope you enjoyed

5
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:39,210
yesterday you had a great time party

6
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:43,470
yesterday so firstly I'd like to tell

7
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,269
you something more about the loose

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,180
project it's called

9
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:49,980
Eragon Dao so firstly I would like to

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,629
ask you know what is Dow just raise your

11
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,709
hand okay so so for those who don't

12
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:59,760
they'll mean decentralized autonomous

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:03,379
organization it means that in these days

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,970
the governments of the states they have

15
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:07,649
monopoly over issuing the business

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,060
licenses so for example you can create

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:15,360
Czech company Spanish company US company

18
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:19,740
but it's quite likely this won't be true

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,619
in the future because now when you want

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,979
to create any organization nonprofit

21
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:28,140
organization or charity or company what

22
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,149
you can do is just make a contract

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,490
between the owner or between the founder

24
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:34,829
of this organization transfer it to

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,810
smart contract put it to blockchain and

26
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,359
create fully decentralized unstoppable

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:46,229
organization which is called Dao and

28
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:49,380
Luis is the guy behind the one of the

29
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,859
most interesting project I tried last

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,149
year

31
00:01:49,859 --> 00:02:00,119
it's called Aragon Dao Aragon is a is

32
00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:03,959
some part of off Spain losses from from

33
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:06,719
from from from Spain and you'll have a

34
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:10,020
presentation about the centralized legal

35
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,350
system we were just talking a bit about

36
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,930
this the central legal system personally

37
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,060
in the past I tried Claro's definitely

38
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,700
check also this project kleros but I'm

39
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,950
especially interested in the klaris

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,859
competition which is implementation of

41
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:33,109
the centralized court system in Aragon

42
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:33,110
Dao so welcome Luis thanks a lot

43
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,950
cool first of all I would like to thank

44
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,870
the organizers for having me here like I

45
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,640
was here last year as well and it's a

46
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,740
crazy like you know a few years ago like

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,970
you said you got a crypto anarchist and

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,590
people looked at you like in a very

49
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,930
weird way like not even understanding

50
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,090
what it means and now I get the sense of

51
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,160
like you know places like this probably

52
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,960
Nepal is here or I was hosting the one

53
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,060
in Bratislava like they are kind of

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,320
raising the bar in what it means to be a

55
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,270
crypto anarchist and just kind of

56
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,769
extending the culture and I think that's

57
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,390
pretty cool cuz I mean like a stripper -

58
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,610
anarchists we are we have a very

59
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,739
important mission and so part of the

60
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,380
mission is realizing the things that are

61
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,390
not working in the world and comedy ties

62
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,790
in them and so one of them was currency

63
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,640
so you know we looked at currency and we

64
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,560
and we said right it doesn't make much

65
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,380
sense for this to be monopolized by

66
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,690
anyone in this case nation-states let's

67
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,940
try to look for a way in which we can

68
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,570
commoditize this and you know bitcoin

69
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,950
was born and then the next thing for for

70
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,019
me like you know I was looking a bit

71
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,970
corn I was like this is great but then

72
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,980
what if we could do the same that

73
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,769
Bitcoin did for money and for a store of

74
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,899
value but for human organization like

75
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,519
today if you want to create a legal

76
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,230
entity if you want to organize with

77
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,290
people you have to go to this

78
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,030
intermediary you have to go to this

79
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,440
entity that has the monopoly over human

80
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,480
organization which is also a

81
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,070
nation-state you have to register a

82
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,630
company you have to register a

83
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,000
partnership you have to register your

84
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,130
nonprofit and and then there are like a

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,890
bunch of like super hard to answer

86
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,100
questions for example can a person in

87
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:12,589
Argentina do business or organize with a

88
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,530
person in Iran and usually the answer is

89
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:18,168
hell no you don't wanna even start

90
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,120
thinking about how like that will work

91
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:22,070
in a legal way in a bureaucratic way

92
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,919
such as the one we have today in the

93
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,570
traditional world and so we built Aragon

94
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,700
and so with Aragon

95
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,040
we just release the the latest version a

96
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,260
few weeks ago it's a very very very very

97
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,910
easy way to create decentralized

98
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,950
organizations and there is a lot of

99
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,200
complexity that I can talk about in the

100
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:43,760
way we make this fully unstoppable

101
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,469
and thoroughly resistant but I think you

102
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,300
can just go to app that are going to

103
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,580
or and experience about yourself it is

104
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,610
very very easy and it is certainly

105
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,450
easier than creating any kind of

106
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,980
bureaucratic organization in the

107
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,159
traditional world so I invite you all to

108
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,740
try it out but then what comes next

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,990
after commoditizing organization after

110
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,880
commoditizing human collaboration and so

111
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,950
we were looking at it from the

112
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,870
perspective of all right let's say that

113
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,300
you know bitcoin succeeds let's say

114
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,310
Aragon succeeds let's say we have all of

115
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,040
this infrastructure to commoditize money

116
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,000
store value human organization and

117
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,130
collaboration

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,720
what does come next what is the next

119
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,850
huge monopoly that we need to

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,040
disintermediate for the world to be more

121
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:28,370
free and we came to the conclusion that

122
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,830
that was the system of law that was in

123
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,450
this case and what I think it's very

124
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,430
important is to have a system of law

125
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,919
that is fully decentralized and global

126
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,320
and so we said all right a system of law

127
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,630
is great but what does a system of law

128
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,230
really imply and so in this case system

129
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,969
of law gives you security over certain

130
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,340
things for example private property

131
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,160
gives you security uncertainty over

132
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,989
contract to our relationships and in

133
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,210
some ways the smart contracts already do

134
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,770
this but not to a full extent because

135
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,710
the smart contracts cannot really cover

136
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,479
everything that a human contract can

137
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,830
have smart contracts are very self

138
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,270
referential and I will talk about that

139
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,820
in a bit

140
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,900
so we said all right in a world in which

141
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,419
you know Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies

142
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,760
succeed and then aragon and decent

143
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,630
rights organizations succeed what is

144
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,849
going to be the next thing that is

145
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,310
needed and we said a decentralized court

146
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,729
a bit centralized system of the law and

147
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:25,580
so we got a started from the from the

148
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,979
place of having a manifesto so I think

149
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,430
manifestos are very interesting because

150
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:34,430
they reflect the pure intent of an

151
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,930
organization of a project and so I got

152
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,160
heavily inspired by the Mozilla

153
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,080
manifesto

154
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,030
when writing the Aragon manifesto and

155
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,560
the argument Festo is the manifesto that

156
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,229
basically unites all the our own

157
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,540
community around a third common vision

158
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:49,130
of the world and so I think that's

159
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,900
really cool because it's a pure state of

160
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,630
an organization like it's it's almost

161
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,700
like the division the high level of what

162
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,260
organizations should do and so when we

163
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,080
look at all of these companies that are

164
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,120
you

165
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,109
kind of terrible from a from a human

166
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,789
point of view i and we look back to like

167
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,099
their origins they usually have like

168
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:10,590
very cool a story very cool origins

169
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:12,750
almost like a manifesto and then over

170
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,250
time they got corrupted and then like we

171
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,449
don't really like they don't really defy

172
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,229
without first manifesto in the first

173
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:21,270
place and so that being said you know we

174
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:23,520
have like that point to start with that

175
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,729
that manifesto that for me is in some

176
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,188
case it's like the high level bylaws of

177
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,659
an organization right so do you have the

178
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:32,430
manifesto which is the vision and then

179
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,319
you encode that into bylaws and the

180
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,150
bylaws are actually how an organization

181
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,419
should work to accomplish that mission

182
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,008
to complete that manifesto and so right

183
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:44,128
now there are a couple kinds of code

184
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:45,750
that we can always that we can encode

185
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:48,539
that manifest to that vision that

186
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,699
purpose into actual like bylaws into

187
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,289
something that creates a human contract

188
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,539
so we can all operate in this

189
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,729
organization to achieve that manifesto

190
00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:00,000
or that goal so one of them is try cold

191
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:01,800
and dry code is smart contracts so I

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,169
guess we're all familiar with a smart

193
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,259
contract in in platforms like aetherium

194
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:09,719
in which you can encode an intent so for

195
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,819
example let's say do you want encode a

196
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:14,610
vesting contract so you want to go the

197
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,589
vesting contract so that a founder or an

198
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,080
employee or any kind of contract or

199
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:20,789
person can gradually have more and more

200
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,440
tokens in your project or search in your

201
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:25,169
company or whatever so they are

202
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,960
incentivized to actually be there in the

203
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:29,878
in the long haul in the long term so for

204
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,010
these you can go the traditional route

205
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,690
which is do you have like a human

206
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,458
language contract and then someone like

207
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,829
each month nothing like that there's an

208
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:40,289
Operations person that sends more shares

209
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:41,698
or more tokens to this person or you can

210
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,919
create a smile contract and so you can

211
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:45,689
create like literally like like 20 lines

212
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,459
of code that basically in code this

213
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,410
logic and then there is no human

214
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,959
intervention role is played on the

215
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,790
blockchain and then each aetherium block

216
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,099
for example it's 14 seconds there are

217
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,689
like new tokens or new shares minted for

218
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,850
this person created for this person and

219
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,800
sent them and that's fully censorship

220
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,390
resistant and there is no way that there

221
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,170
is like some human corruption that

222
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,790
breaks that and so that's really great

223
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,229
it has some issues though like you know

224
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,589
he said like 'hey-- automates everything

225
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,540
away which is great for users

226
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,280
and what you what you see is what you

227
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,050
get so you can take the smart contracts

228
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,300
and that to anyone and it's like you

229
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,490
know the way the contract works that's

230
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,870
it I mean there can be errors which is

231
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,610
one of the downsides of a smart

232
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,420
contracts something like the Dow in

233
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,420
which the human programmer fails to

234
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,160
encode that in a way that reflects the

235
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,040
original intent so you may encode a

236
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,300
testing contract and then suddenly put

237
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,860
something in there that doesn't do

238
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,069
vesting that if they're like burns all

239
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,930
the tokens and destroys all of them

240
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,700
which I mean definitely can happen or

241
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,959
you can have even errors in the compiler

242
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,700
so like you know all of these things

243
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,290
that are there there's a bunch of

244
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,420
technology that is so much like black

245
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,790
boxes for a lot of people because as a

246
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,560
programmer you just write the code and

247
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,180
then things may fail so that's obviously

248
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,219
something that it's kind of a downside

249
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,489
and it's very experimental technology

250
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,380
anyway so it's also very inflexible so

251
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,540
like in a human contract in an English

252
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,930
written contract like basically language

253
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,760
is like you know your barrier and with

254
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,229
theoretically with human language you

255
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,290
can express everything that can be

256
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,180
expressed with code sometimes it's not

257
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,849
like that because it's very hard to

258
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,290
encode very like subjective clauses like

259
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,030
everything is very objective

260
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,099
you cannot encode like subjective views

261
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,900
of the world and then also self

262
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,170
referential and so what that means is

263
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,270
that a theorem or any like blockchain

264
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,740
that can execute as my contract knows

265
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,540
about what's in the blockchain but

266
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,210
doesn't know about what it's outside so

267
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,560
the example that I always put is you

268
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,270
know you want hire an employee you want

269
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,949
to give them hardware and the one that

270
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,530
hardware to be returned once the

271
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,670
employee leaves and so the Russian

272
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,839
doesn't know about Hardware the

273
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,339
blockchain doesn't know about like the

274
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,100
mean space doesn't know about this table

275
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,080
or this bowl of water so obviously like

276
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,010
you can encode that in a like a smart

277
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,620
contract but then we have wet code by

278
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:07,080
the way dry cold wet code is like the

279
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,310
the terms that Nick Szabo coined for for

280
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,480
defining these things and I think they

281
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,859
are very interesting and so what code is

282
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,090
human language basically the contracts

283
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,340
we are all used to

284
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,900
in a traditional world and so they are

285
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,120
very flexible as flexible as human

286
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,410
language gets in which theoretical you

287
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,900
can express everything that can be

288
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,949
expressed and can reference this world

289
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,769
of water can refer

290
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:30,480
this table can reference the mid space

291
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:32,430
but in the other hand like since it's so

292
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,440
subjective is very prone to disputes

293
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,290
because you know I can interpret

294
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,600
different things language is not like so

295
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,329
reactive sometimes especially across us

296
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,199
Dixon across like cultures because

297
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:49,769
cultures also play like a huge sort of

298
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:52,079
play in this in this world and and also

299
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:54,899
there is like some I put it very nicely

300
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,510
here of blindness skin in the game which

301
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:59,970
means that for a contract to work in a

302
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,490
traditional world there is either jail

303
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,350
time or violence involved so that's what

304
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,790
I call offline skin the game that like

305
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,769
you know people with guns can come to

306
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,329
your home and get you out it's probably

307
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,420
like the best alpha mr. michael proudly

308
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:14,849
come come up with and then also I think

309
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,620
it promotes uncertainty because it is

310
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,329
not code like with this my contract it's

311
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,050
like literally what you see is what it's

312
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:23,099
going to get executed period with this

313
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,740
human language contract is really bit

314
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,750
more different and so you know who

315
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,279
answers the right code is executed that

316
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,019
would be a lot in like a theorem in this

317
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,149
case or any other blockchain that can

318
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,519
execute my contracts like a theorem

319
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,260
classic or rootstock and so you have a

320
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,360
decentralized network predictable

321
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,220
execution and it can get expensive

322
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,170
depending on the network so like for

323
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,510
example if a room right now is like the

324
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,920
biggest one in has raid it is getting

325
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,130
quite expensive especially when there

326
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,199
are like crypto kitties games or like

327
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,640
Ponzi schemes running on the blockchain

328
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:56,189
and then everyone is that clock in the

329
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,839
network so but I think it's ok for

330
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,490
certain use cases in which you really

331
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,810
want that high security and if you don't

332
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,579
want that you can always use other

333
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:05,699
cannot block chains that are like lower

334
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:07,430
security but also lower cost and so who

335
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:09,390
answers with code is enforced

336
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,189
that's the definitely for in this case

337
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,769
Ian that's like governments that those

338
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:17,010
are Trump put in these politicians in

339
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,839
the world so I mean they got sentries of

340
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,189
experience like I mean I'm not gonna I'm

341
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,390
gonna say no to that like it's true

342
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,220
traditional governments have been

343
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,660
running for a long long time and they

344
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,180
have a system of checks and balances

345
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,730
that you theory isolates you know the

346
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,819
the judicial power from the executive

347
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:35,279
power and all those things the

348
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:37,529
traditional system the traditional court

349
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,420
system it is very very slow as low as it

350
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:42,090
possibly gets like a harness period

351
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:45,000
so literally unscrew for an apartment

352
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,170
that I was renting in Barcelona and it

353
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,420
took me like I don't know like probably

354
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,420
nine months to get my deposit back

355
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:53,490
because the guy didn't wanna like give

356
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,780
it back to me and with this my contract

357
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,940
you don't even need that it's just like

358
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,589
literally like this is CRO this is the

359
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,080
party that like verified that the

360
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,610
transaction went okay do it back boom no

361
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,710
nine months and I hide in lawyers

362
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,630
involved it is extremely expensive like

363
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,640
sometimes there are disputes in which

364
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,530
you are right so there was this this

365
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,340
dispute of like some food intoxication

366
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:16,050
and a mom lost her her kid and she

367
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,220
literally had to like spend I think a

368
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,689
million dollars in lawyer or something

369
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,460
like that to take on it was a big

370
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,380
corporation like Nestle and in that to

371
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,450
take on this corporation and it was like

372
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,910
12 years until the case was resolved so

373
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,980
it is very expensive very slow and at

374
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,689
the end of the day what that does is it

375
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,600
reduces fairness in the world because

376
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,890
you have unfair outcome and to get there

377
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
you need to spend a million dollars in

378
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,210
twelve years and that's just terrible

379
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,090
for I don't know and like my end up mom

380
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,130
is just like terrible it is local and

381
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,960
hard to navigate so if you if you have

382
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,650
run an organization that has people all

383
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,680
across the world

384
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:52,050
like for example Aragon one my my team

385
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,609
working on arrogance development we have

386
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,260
people across I think like 20 different

387
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,790
jurisdiction or something like that so

388
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,400
like it is very hard

389
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:02,790
it's like country has its own kind of

390
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,819
regulations and so it's just like you

391
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,770
know nor'easter navigate and then there

392
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,060
is unlimited liability which means you

393
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,470
know people with guns can come to your

394
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,540
place and in some places they can

395
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,150
actually like just kill you sometimes

396
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,400
you do the death penalty and that's it

397
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,860
so what if try and word code had a child

398
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,209
which is a leave it of a joke I think I

399
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,580
think John from I think call it the

400
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:30,090
ether Trump which which is a little

401
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:33,080
scary so just don't have nightmares with

402
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:35,250
the ether Trump looks pretty nightmarish

403
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,400
nobody just kidding we're not going to

404
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:41,730
implement the ether Trump so you know if

405
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,720
those kind of two systems had a rocky I

406
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,790
think you will be like this

407
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,320
decentralized system of law and so you

408
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,360
have a system of law that is secured by

409
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,250
crypto Kaname incentives so like no one

410
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,900
can like you know get thrown in jail or

411
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,550
be sentenced to death penalty

412
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,170
it would be orders of magnitude faster

413
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,390
because we can use scribble economic

414
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,069
incentives and we can use technology to

415
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,500
basically make it faster to make sure

416
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,940
that this resolution is way faster way

417
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,790
cheaper because we are commoditizing

418
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,290
we're taking it away from a monopoly to

419
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,540
actually you know making it something

420
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,880
that can be forked so like you have a

421
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,620
court if it is not working or serving

422
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,570
well its purpose it can be forked

423
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,590
they're going more efficiency and when

424
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,840
there is free market some more

425
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,030
efficiency things get cheaper they get

426
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,440
faster they get better and also

427
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,970
community govern because like for

428
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,710
example in this case the specific court

429
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,480
we are working on the Oregon Court is

430
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,600
going to be governed by AMT holders

431
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,010
holders of the Argo Network token so

432
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,780
it's going to be basically governed by

433
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,370
the island community you can't support

434
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,079
it and make it governed by other

435
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,720
communities what you think is very very

436
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,980
important and then the only drawback is

437
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,230
you know this is very very experimental

438
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,850
bleeding edge technology like we are

439
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,650
pushing the boundaries of what can be

440
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,120
done with the smart contract systems so

441
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,890
it's interesting because we are using a

442
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,290
smart contract platform and smart

443
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:56,650
contracts to implement a system of law

444
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,969
and that interprets wet code so that's

445
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,770
an interpreter smart contracts it

446
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:06,520
interprets like you know basically human

447
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:08,589
written contracts and so I want to get

448
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,240
back to like decent rationalizations and

449
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,069
why this makes sense for decent rights

450
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,050
organizations and for Aragon in

451
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:17,200
particular so this entire organization

452
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,629
serve a cheap and an easy to maintain

453
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,280
and be creative they are pseudonymity

454
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,870
friendly you can interact with decent

455
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,619
rights organizations without having to

456
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,780
KYC

457
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:28,510
which for me is like so so important and

458
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,889
there is total execution certainty you

459
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,570
can know that if there is a vesting

460
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,580
contract implemented or a payroll

461
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,830
contract in this Dow in this

462
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,480
decentralized organization is gonna get

463
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,189
executed like that there is no

464
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,610
corruption or anything like that

465
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,440
in the middle that can make things worse

466
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,240
in the problem is that as I said before

467
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,300
it is right cold so it is very hard to

468
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,120
like encode subtlety of the human mind

469
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:55,450
and also in here is interesting point is

470
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,969
subjective all 2:51 person attacks and

471
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,740
so what this attack entails is that in

472
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,080
mind you have an open Dow so for example

473
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,510
let's say the Dow back in the day and

474
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,310
imagine this now has a mechanism in

475
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,740
which token holders come with Rafa

476
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:12,370
from this towel so here you may have a

477
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:15,610
51% majority of the Dow saying hey I

478
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,560
want to take funds from this Dow a and I

479
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,550
wanna I want to put them into this Dow

480
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,610
be

481
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,280
for example and so this BB is used 51%

482
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,719
of a token holders of this other Dow

483
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,389
what happens with the other 49 percent

484
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,710
of holders here the minority like

485
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,300
a stake holders maybe they are not

486
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,770
paying attention maybe they use hold a

487
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,840
token but they don't do much about it

488
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,590
what happens is that a boat will go

489
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,840
through in this town

490
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,330
51 percent of the attackers will get the

491
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,149
funds out to their pocket and the other

492
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:45,550
49 percent in this Dow a just gets kind

493
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,680
of a screwed over and that's it so

494
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,870
that's a very important attacked resolve

495
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,580
is if we want open dowse which i think

496
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,750
are the interesting doubts open dousing

497
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,760
which anyone can buy a token and

498
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,400
participate in a pseudonymous way to

499
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,610
actually flourish so what are we solving

500
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,070
here with this court so we're solving

501
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,810
well the the couple things is mentioned

502
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,790
and we are solving as well the fact that

503
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,950
traditional courts are very slow they

504
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,980
are very spensive and they are use kind

505
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,560
of a pain in the ass to interact with

506
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,900
and so we can use this mark contracts to

507
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,879
make this way more efficient so

508
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,390
basically what we are doing is creating

509
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,330
system of law and creating a court as

510
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:28,210
you know courts exist with yours and

511
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,340
with with appealing systems that you can

512
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,470
appeal if you are not comfortable with

513
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,780
the result of your first ruling and we

514
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,630
are building all of that using a smart

515
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,550
contract and creating like basically the

516
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,230
world's first detailed restriction along

517
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,560
the way because if you have a system of

518
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:48,760
law you basically have a u.s. diction so

519
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,899
I glimpse into a future the idea is you

520
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,120
create your organization

521
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,320
you cried your manifest or bylaws so

522
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,229
like basically you say you know this

523
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,169
organization is gonna disallow 51%

524
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,610
attacks because we don't believe that

525
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,320
51% of token holders should be able to

526
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,330
screw all the minority participants over

527
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,510
which it's kind of how it works in the

528
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:10,210
traditional world like if you own shares

529
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:12,010
in a company and in those shares

530
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,840
entitled you'd like you know part of the

531
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,060
of the revenue your profits or whatever

532
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,429
like usually the other like shareholders

533
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,810
cannot use take money away from you like

534
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,120
that right like there are

535
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:24,550
certain guarantees that we lack in this

536
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,649
decentralized world right now and so the

537
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,120
idea is you write these bylaws as the

538
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,060
creator of the Dow or the creators of

539
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,399
the Dow and then a user proposed a vote

540
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,490
in the Dow and then they stake they put

541
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,010
like some tokens or some dice on BTC

542
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,420
from whatever dais take some talk and

543
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,970
some value to have some skin in the game

544
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,610
and then anyone can review the nature of

545
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,680
that vote that the user created so let's

546
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,850
say it's a it's a vote to actually take

547
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,890
money away from all the other

548
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,600
participants and they can say all right

549
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,610
this doesn't quite match the

550
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,810
organization's bylaws or manifested

551
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,240
because you are taking money away from

552
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,570
this minority participants and so then

553
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,430
you can create a dispute and then

554
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,500
randomly there are jurors selected this

555
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,540
yours happens like a stake in this court

556
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,730
and they have reputation in this court

557
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,560
as well and so they get selected they

558
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,470
get drafted they look at the evidence

559
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,909
and then they rule just like a selling

560
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,860
point mechanism so basically you have

561
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:21,370
five jurors drafted and three of them

562
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:23,709
say you know the the proposal is not

563
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,929
true then go forward because it doesn't

564
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,200
really match the organization's bylaws

565
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:31,690
then the the use of the proposed vote

566
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,850
gets his last so they lose their tokens

567
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:38,650
and then that's case closed and the user

568
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,240
can always appeal and can say you know I

569
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,790
don't like this ruling so I want appeal

570
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,590
to like 11 euros and then I want to

571
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,540
build 21 and then I want appeal to like

572
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,669
you know multiplies the number of yours

573
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,190
until you have the whole network so

574
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:55,090
basically what we do here is the

575
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,980
security of this network relies on like

576
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:00,100
the security of the whole Aragon Network

577
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,810
so basically if like 51 percent of the

578
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,340
network gets compromised we may have

579
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:05,020
some trouble if it doesn't get

580
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,790
compromised you're okay because you can

581
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,129
always appeal until the whole network of

582
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,780
euros is the control in and even with

583
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,220
that there is like another mechanism to

584
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,280
make this even more secure but that gets

585
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,780
into the realm of like fork in two

586
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,280
courts at the same time having them

587
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,050
competing using food are key which is

588
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,980
like a super no awareness mechanism so I

589
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,840
don't want to get into that aspect

590
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,920
that's like the bleeding edge of like

591
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,459
bleeding edge of like the bleeding edge

592
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:30,100
and so right now how it works is there

593
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:33,549
is a spoken-- and so it's a governance

594
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:36,850
token for the whole project int and it

595
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:38,320
is the the governance of the parade

596
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,488
itself is when I use the court because

597
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,168
we have this very interesting use case

598
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:42,999
where we need the court for ourselves

599
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:44,889
like right now how I set up the whole

600
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:47,249
project is there this entity this legal

601
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:49,869
entity called the Oregon association and

602
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:51,759
there is this process for any token

603
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,738
holder or any person in the community or

604
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,570
in general anyone even sued when most

605
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:57,850
participants to propose changes to the

606
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:01,509
project so they can propose finance

607
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:03,759
proposals to take money from the from

608
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:05,049
the projects fans and spend it into like

609
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,690
a development team or something like

610
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:10,090
that and they can also choose to change

611
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,619
the governance mechanism itself they can

612
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,238
choose to do proclamations so for

613
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:15,668
example at the network the a

614
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:17,440
proclamation that February the 10th is

615
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:20,470
the is 5 for freedom day it's like

616
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,149
Eragon day and so this this network this

617
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,999
Dao can do many things but right now

618
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:26,799
since the funds come directly from the

619
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:28,989
argument session this legal entity that

620
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,730
is a token still back in the day we have

621
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:32,379
the issue that this legal entity has to

622
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,779
like respond to like a traditional legal

623
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:35,949
system so this entity is a centralized

624
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:37,899
point of failure right now because he

625
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,509
needs to curate these proposals so if

626
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:42,459
there's a report that some participants

627
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:44,559
ends which is for example you know send

628
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,080
money to this team or send money to this

629
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,480
other team for development then the

630
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,149
decision make sure that nothing legal is

631
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,159
go in there or totally immoral and then

632
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:55,840
curates and give the cheque of approval

633
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,269
and that that goes in to the vote a

634
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,220
whole network can vote they so there is

635
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:02,289
obviously does not be centralized so

636
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,720
what we would like to do is write the

637
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:06,970
things like the kind of black list of

638
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,369
proposals that shouldn't go through

639
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,139
publish that get that into a vote so the

640
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:13,299
whole network votes and once they vote

641
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:14,408
on it is gonna be the court the one that

642
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:16,299
curates proposals

643
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:18,369
so this Aragon Association is legal

644
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:20,918
entity can basically disappear and the

645
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:23,820
whole thing will still work so we need

646
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,139
to use the court for that our sauce and

647
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,019
yeah then either when I get too much to

648
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:30,279
a technicals of the token stuff then you

649
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:32,830
know the idea is that it's gonna be fast

650
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,389
and cheap so like the maximum time right

651
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,220
now with the current parameters of this

652
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:39,699
court which obviously become fork and

653
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:42,700
changed to supply your needs but right

654
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,950
now the maximum time that a court case

655
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,330
can be open it's a month and thus if you

656
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,320
appeal to like the whole network if you

657
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,210
do all the appeal

658
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,340
for like five years the initial threat

659
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,260
of you worst like all the way to a

660
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,250
network and one month is like nothing

661
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,390
compared to like years in the

662
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,950
traditional world and this is like a

663
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,300
pill into like a total level if you

664
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,400
don't appeal it may be like a matter of

665
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,649
days like if you are comfortable with

666
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,610
the first ruling it's like a couple days

667
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:09,310
boom settled orders of magnitude cheaper

668
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:13,600
no millions of dollars wasted in lawyers

669
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:14,980
hopefully I mean not even really

670
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,990
requiring lawyers I think that would be

671
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,760
like my ILS scenario in which cause

672
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,740
right now is a really stupid I we need

673
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,050
to hire professional people to explain

674
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,040
us how like our legal system works like

675
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,379
it should be something that people

676
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,649
citizens know about and that we can

677
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,780
understand we have having to hire people

678
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,790
intermediaries that can always trick us

679
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,710
and so and then one very very very cool

680
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,450
use case here is that we're working on

681
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,070
this fundraising platform for decent

682
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,310
rights organizations Corrigan friend

683
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,960
racing and so the way this can be

684
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:46,060
plugged together with the court is that

685
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,430
imagine there's a case that is like a

686
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:51,429
David versus Goliath kind of case so you

687
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:53,560
have like this huge corporation or this

688
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,540
nation state which is clearly wrong in

689
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,980
this particular case and you have this

690
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,680
like you know super super small

691
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,870
individual who wants to challenge that

692
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,220
make a corporation or a national state

693
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,949
in this particular case and it's very

694
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,810
clear that here Goliath was the one that

695
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,790
was wrong and David was the one that

696
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,679
would actually right so what they can do

697
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:13,990
is they can fundraise money they can

698
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,180
open like a token sale of sorts and they

699
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,330
can fundraise money that goes directly

700
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:22,420
into a scroll contract to fund the

701
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:25,540
disputes like basically if Goliath wants

702
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:28,090
to appeal every time you appeal it gets

703
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,010
a little more expensive so if you want

704
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,480
to if you want to appeal until the whole

705
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:33,520
network it may actually get a little bit

706
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,930
expensive though this is my contract you

707
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,260
can make sure that like you know if you

708
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,890
put like one Bitcoin here or one die

709
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,660
here

710
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,120
into this contract you are going to get

711
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,800
X percent of the profits if they if the

712
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,739
court case is one so you can basically

713
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,000
bet on a court case being won and right

714
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,410
now that kind of happens we like

715
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,320
fundraisers like I should have happened

716
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:55,300
some time but it's very you know trashed

717
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,429
a lot in the person that is when the is

718
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,960
between the fundraiser because obviously

719
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,820
like they can just kind of run away with

720
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,180
money here is like literally Smarr

721
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,610
contra

722
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:06,280
like you put one die in the cord gets

723
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:09,459
one after X weeks and then you get

724
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,770
returned to die for example if the if

725
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,290
the court was rolling you're in your

726
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,750
favor in the favor of the of David in

727
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,980
this case versus Goliath so that's very

728
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,810
very cool because I think that really

729
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,370
increases fairness like you can you can

730
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:25,480
go vs Goliath

731
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:26,770
kind of guy and and still win because

732
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,550
you can fundraise for your case very

733
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:32,590
easily and then finally it's gonna be

734
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,540
like a base to use web app you're gonna

735
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,250
have like a dispute button and then you

736
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,129
click dispute open a dispute that's it

737
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:41,890
you don't need to like go anywhere in

738
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,030
this terrible court systems that make

739
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,040
you spend a lot of time just moving

740
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,540
around and go into you're also like one

741
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,190
interesting thing about like if you're

742
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,629
nomads and you need to like go to a

743
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,340
court case you literally have to like

744
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,320
fly for whatever it's worth like where

745
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,480
that court is located physically located

746
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,100
to like be there that's just crazy like

747
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,750
for me like these things are using

748
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,860
architected centuries ago and they have

749
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:05,170
involved so we are starting your own

750
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,120
boarding and now you can sign up into

751
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:09,520
like like a mailing list to get news

752
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,500
about this anyone can become a euro like

753
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,360
you know if there's like a 12 year old

754
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,110
kid in India that is very good at

755
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,610
reviewing disputes and and at reviewing

756
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,110
you know prior art in a case and all of

757
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,209
that they can't become a euro and they

758
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,520
can make a living off it so that's very

759
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,380
very cool and then we are actually

760
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,120
rolling this out in December so you can

761
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,890
actually like sign up into a network as

762
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,040
a juror and you will be able to

763
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:36,550
basically start performing actual

764
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,500
dispute resolution on January so I am

765
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,060
actually generate twenty twenty because

766
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,700
this was this year and with the finale

767
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,870
in loan secured this year but I'm so so

768
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,240
excited because we're literally like you

769
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,770
know a luncheon a decentralised musician

770
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,070
from scratch and I'm so excited that you

771
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,440
know

772
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,760
Bitcoin was able to commoditize money

773
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,990
master of Bali for the world

774
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,640
Aragon is doing the same for

775
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,440
decentralized organizations and now

776
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,510
we're trying to do the same for a system

777
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,910
of law so we get all of these amazing

778
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:04,390
tools that a crypto anarchists are and

779
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:07,360
or as like Sir individuals we can use to

780
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:09,340
live in a really free and fair world so

781
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,659
I couldn't be more excited some leagues

782
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,169
here in which you can check the white

783
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,130
paper the actual code where this is

784
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:18,520
going to be

785
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,720
you know basically coded in program it's

786
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,070
very cool like people that are working

787
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,710
on these that programmers are working on

788
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:26,409
this they are you know sometimes they

789
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:29,289
realize like I am writing a court like a

790
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:30,460
young writing code to create a court and

791
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:32,830
it's kind of crazy if you think about it

792
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,840
like we can code institutions today we

793
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:37,149
can program them we can use you know

794
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,668
encode how they will work so that's

795
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,950
pretty cool you can follow Eragon on

796
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:43,120
Twitter you can follow me and if you are

797
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,820
interested in this kind of stuff

798
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,260
governance a smart contract

799
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,510
decentralization there are some openings

800
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,669
that we have especially for technical

801
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:53,919
technical roles and also we have another

802
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:55,450
opening for ahead of support so that's

803
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:03,820
it thank you so much now we're gonna

804
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:05,380
have some questions thanks ok let's

805
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,780
thank a lot for your interesting

806
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:12,690
presentation it's time for question and

807
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:15,250
answers so yeah we have a question here

808
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:18,220
very exciting work

809
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:21,250
aside from staking what have you

810
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,890
explored for decentralized identity

811
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:28,299
seems to be an important element to a

812
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:31,840
legal system yeah in terms of identity

813
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:33,460
we haven't worked so much in like our

814
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,590
own solutions we are trying to rely on

815
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,679
other people that are working on it so I

816
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:40,120
think there are on the metadata space so

817
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,880
I've been able to use basically like put

818
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,408
a face to someone or a name to like an a

819
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,539
theorem address there is there a couple

820
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:48,700
alternatives one of them is three books

821
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:50,140
that I'm very excited about so you can

822
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,210
have your own profile and your own like

823
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,340
activity field so instead of like

824
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,539
interacting with 0 X 1 to 3 you can see

825
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,100
like the metadata of this person that

826
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:59,530
you're interacting with maybe even like

827
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,030
connect their socials you can rest

828
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,850
assure that like this person is the one

829
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,379
that you want to interact with and then

830
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,709
in terms of like more kind of reputation

831
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,630
web of trust kind of model there is one

832
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,070
called bright idea they are working on

833
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,860
basically like a web of trust kind of

834
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,899
identity system in our case for the

835
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,178
court we don't necessarily need that so

836
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,760
much because we actually use relying on

837
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:23,710
pseudo most participants so we don't

838
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,500
really need that so much like basically

839
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,450
we need to keep track of like a Dewar's

840
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,460
reputation in the network

841
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,080
when to keep track of the stakes that a

842
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,320
user has but we can do that with just

843
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,320
basically like their theme addresses

844
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Thanks

845
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,480
thank you for a dog I have a question

846
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:46,050
how are you going to ensure the fair

847
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,390
trial within one month trial including

848
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,669
all the appeals especially in the cases

849
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,520
where the evidence process is

850
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:57,440
complicated so let's say you have 5,000

851
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:00,420
pages of documents to go through and

852
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,420
consider if there are write or analyze

853
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:06,180
them without the principles and

854
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,820
instruments to ensure it Thanks yeah

855
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,050
that's a real question I think for when

856
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,270
things get more and more complicated

857
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:14,250
like right now we are targeting simple

858
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,379
cases like this 51% of that protection

859
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,460
when there is more and more prior art

860
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,170
because at the end of the day like

861
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,490
what's gonna happen with this is people

862
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,990
are gonna start solving cases and that's

863
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,920
gonna create jurisprudence and so that

864
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:28,770
will really arise complexity so I think

865
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,620
stuff like you know 5,000 pages really

866
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:32,610
seems very hard to do for like 5 euros

867
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,250
in like two days

868
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:37,439
I think so definitely if that happens we

869
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,450
may need to like to the parameters it's

870
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,720
like it takes more time I mean I would

871
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,760
really like to see a world where like

872
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,230
there is no like 5,000 basic contracts

873
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,180
to start with because a lot of this can

874
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,350
be taken care of by like smart contracts

875
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,690
and everything that is like very

876
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:54,030
objective we can just put it there and

877
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,680
we like really use this as like a last

878
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,820
resort kind of mechanism for things that

879
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,710
use cannot be included in smart

880
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:01,050
contracts by definitely thing that if

881
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,370
that happens we all know are gonna need

882
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:07,139
to act with the parameters in the court

883
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:08,129
maybe Thanks here thanks for the talk I

884
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,260
really loved the idea

885
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:13,620
my question is how is the governance

886
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:16,170
talking and distributed yeah so right

887
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,290
now I think there are like 20k token

888
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:22,770
holders we talk in still back in 2017

889
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,210
and I think a lot of that this is kind

890
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,940
of distributed across like community

891
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,830
participants I think a lot of people

892
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,930
also are like from development teams

893
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:32,639
so this arguin association entity owns I

894
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,200
think 20% of the supply and use gives

895
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,480
grants like development teams that are

896
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,580
actually building it so in terms of the

897
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,680
distribution I think it's like builders

898
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,100
and then and there's really like a part

899
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,770
of it

900
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,209
we don't even know who like they are the

901
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:50,129
owners like actually most of it because

902
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:51,630
we like we selecting 70% or 80% and a

903
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,690
lot of that is used like unknown

904
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,590
aetherium addresses that is hard to know

905
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:59,070
which is really very cool like I don't

906
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:00,629
want to know who they are right hey

907
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,970
Louie thank you very much for the

908
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,770
presentation I'm a very big fan of every

909
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,809
single decentralized court idea and

910
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:09,359
stuff like that I'm a lawyer myself and

911
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:11,639
I have basically thousands of questions

912
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,009
right now but there are two really very

913
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,590
important ones and the first one how are

914
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:19,440
you going to ensure the quality of the

915
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:21,030
jurors that's the one and the second one

916
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,000
is the enforcement because if I

917
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,889
understand it correctly right now you

918
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,440
basically ensure the enforcement of the

919
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,540
decision by locking the funds into a

920
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,730
smart contract before the case actually

921
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,830
starts but it's not how it works in

922
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,869
reality right now so let's say I have a

923
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,730
dispute with an Indian company and it's

924
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:40,770
about a hundred thousand euros I don't

925
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:42,750
have the funds to lock in to the smart

926
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,580
contract before the you know court

927
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,080
proceedings actually start so how are

928
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,350
you going to solve this problem thank

929
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,759
you

930
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:51,899
never sure so on the on the second one

931
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,850
you don't need to like pull the money

932
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:56,520
upfront for appeals so let's say there

933
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:58,380
is just like the the first round then

934
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,000
you need to just put up the like mistake

935
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,500
for that first round if you wanna do

936
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,060
like subsequent appeals and you can put

937
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,460
the money there but what is actually a

938
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,759
very good point there is that both

939
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,130
participants like they have a mistake

940
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,350
put and they cannot lose more than that

941
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,670
meaning that you know if you got into an

942
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,290
agreement with like a freelance

943
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,410
developer to build a website and you

944
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:22,109
wanna ensure up to like 5k dollars or

945
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:24,000
whatever and both participants put the

946
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:26,310
same amount that's the maximum amount of

947
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,140
the court can take away from them so

948
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,850
there is no like you have to make sure

949
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,140
that basically what you put in the stake

950
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:34,290
is like the maximum amount that you are

951
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,580
like able to like dispute because you

952
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,320
cannot like a city for like you cannot

953
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,609
take someone to like jail or you cannot

954
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,050
like you know pointing with a gun so

955
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:43,109
that's kind of the all the trade-off

956
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,310
that we're making and then on beyond the

957
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:47,580
first point how do we ensure quality

958
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:49,589
viewers like Cupid economics kind of do

959
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,140
because if they are not able to perform

960
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:53,490
they're gonna lose money so like in a

961
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,250
rational world events rate they are you

962
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,009
just gonna like stop

963
00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:01,540
yours so that'sthat's the way that we

964
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:03,190
make further quality thanks I thank you

965
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,320
for that talk it was very interesting I

966
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,880
was walking on bisque for a while and we

967
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,030
also have a kind of dispute resolution

968
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,910
system so questions like this came up I

969
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:15,910
have maybe one remark and one question

970
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:18,819
and the remark is that so this is like a

971
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:21,549
code for internal other gun metals and

972
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,500
and not every dispute that I have in

973
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,120
life in an organization goes to court

974
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,860
sometimes very often it was taught

975
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:31,299
inside organization and went was done

976
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:33,670
very quickly so it seems to me like a

977
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,440
good way to solve these pits you know

978
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:38,410
the status organization not necessarily

979
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,760
in you know caught between random people

980
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:41,799
which is a bit different thing but it

981
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,270
just might point of view and the other

982
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,040
questions as you pointed out the court

983
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:47,500
system is slow we have lawyers it's

984
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,680
expensive we have cause it's overwhelmed

985
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,900
but this is not because of jurisdiction

986
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,089
issue this is because you need to phrase

987
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,650
an agreement which shows the intention

988
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,690
between two individuals in a way which

989
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,460
is understandable for everybody and not

990
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,470
everybody can be a judge even if you do

991
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,900
the appeal system with supposed to

992
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,509
ensure that if one layer makes a mistake

993
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,160
you can appeal and I'm not sure what

994
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,720
will happen in your system if you start

995
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,790
to be popular and it you win you won't

996
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,770
find that you reinvent the wheel so

997
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:17,529
that's kind of a question if you're not

998
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:19,509
afraid of it so do you mean like if

999
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,040
you're or see if we cannot ensure the

1000
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,750
quality of viewers you just get like

1001
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,450
populated with like a bunch of random

1002
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:28,050
people then don't know how to rule so

1003
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:30,460
you would need somehow to face the

1004
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,590
agreements which are being coated and

1005
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,910
how do you do that eventually without

1006
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:36,430
lawyers in the way with the people who

1007
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,680
judge us which is the standard and the

1008
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:41,460
quality of the jurors I mean there is a

1009
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,620
reason but not anybody can be a judge in

1010
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,760
classical court right yeah yeah and

1011
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,350
definitely not worried about that

1012
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,710
innocence that they will just lose money

1013
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:52,600
if they are no good yours I am

1014
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,010
definitely concerned about how to encode

1015
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,049
the agreements in a way that is

1016
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,090
understandable like I mean I think a lot

1017
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:00,010
of the other parts why wouldn't lawyers

1018
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,870
today is like cross your section kind of

1019
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,030
trade like I definitely disagree or not

1020
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:05,859
I think that's a huge part of it and I

1021
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,650
and I've been working on on that with

1022
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,630
some lawyers and just like a pain yes

1023
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,400
to deal with the complexity but I do

1024
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,740
think that on the other hand like there

1025
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,780
is a need to encode that into like

1026
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,919
something some human readable agreement

1027
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,950
that everyone can understand and that's

1028
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,620
why sometimes we use lawyers I hope we

1029
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:24,480
can automate a lot of that we stuff like

1030
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,370
AI and just kind of you know creating

1031
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,080
agreements or reusing agreements or

1032
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,330
open-source in them like a lot of

1033
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,370
today's agreements for alyssa startups

1034
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,810
for example to use basically copy and

1035
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,460
paste like existing ones because you can

1036
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,440
like open source them so I hope we can

1037
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,020
and I don't think we're going to get rid

1038
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,790
completely of lawyers like in the

1039
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,830
foreseeable future by them we can really

1040
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,910
like reduce the amount of lawyers and

1041
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,440
their course that is needed in the

1042
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:50,819
future

1043
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:53,460
Thanks do you have any plans to done do

1044
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,470
trials or tests comparing your mechanism

1045
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,270
to some other mechanism in some sort of

1046
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:58,410
controlled environment to share that it

1047
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,630
actually works better than something

1048
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:03,000
else yeah definitely I mean the cool

1049
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,860
thing about this is you can model it you

1050
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,330
can you can create aliens like

1051
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,800
rationally and start spreading it out

1052
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,390
but I think the the best way to actually

1053
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,700
try it out is launch it and see how

1054
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:13,589
disputes work so I think we're gonna get

1055
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,000
a sense of that like as early as q1 next

1056
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,740
year and I'm super excited I mean it's a

1057
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,360
huge experiment right so like it may

1058
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:21,509
fail the first time it fell the second

1059
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:23,400
time but I think the just creating like

1060
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:29,130
a decentralized court we're going to

1061
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:30,750
learn so much oh here it's very

1062
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,060
interesting I realized right now that

1063
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:35,850
you wouldn't try any murders or this

1064
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:37,820
kind of dispute of course but in

1065
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:41,990
combination with mr. hands mr. duvall

1066
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:45,750
presentation about putting a fine as a

1067
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:47,609
as a penalty for any kind of unlawful

1068
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,980
action and also having vouchers paying

1069
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:53,310
for it then probably this combination

1070
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:57,210
becomes more interesting for a complete

1071
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:59,970
let's say system that takes away both

1072
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:02,430
prosecution and also trying of cases

1073
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,370
from the state what I can understanding

1074
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:08,899
in this very distinct case how would the

1075
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:13,170
market between courts operate

1076
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:15,060
voucher maybe and an offended person and

1077
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:19,170
we have to go to court hoc which is

1078
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:21,710
Aragon instead of another one would this

1079
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,710
have to be

1080
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:30,880
beforehand or who would enforce trying

1081
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,820
my case with a voter from a pending

1082
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,890
person with you instead of another court

1083
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,350
because baby courts may also have some

1084
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,089
kind of constitutional biases you know

1085
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,040
some could be more liberal other

1086
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:44,680
well conservative or what ever the case

1087
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,620
might be so how would the market monitor

1088
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,390
maybe would operate in this case yeah I

1089
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,779
think it's similar to how you choose

1090
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:54,549
like private mediation mechanisms so you

1091
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,550
basically start a contract with someone

1092
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:59,020
and you say you know you stopped using

1093
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,960
the activation record we're going to use

1094
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:04,030
this mechanism as like the first resort

1095
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,560
you can do that then I mean I think it

1096
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,390
gets way easier when like the

1097
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,250
organization is on chain because it's

1098
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,900
like native to on chain organizations if

1099
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,910
not you will have to like draft a

1100
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,010
contract saying you know where we are

1101
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,629
going to resort to this like private

1102
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:24,940
mediation that is their own Court before

1103
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:29,680
going into like a traditional court for

1104
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:31,420
a murder I mean definitely that won't

1105
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,460
work because like I mean this has

1106
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:36,730
limitations for example murder like you

1107
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:39,190
cannot I mean well actually you could

1108
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,410
like you could support evidence that you

1109
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:44,350
murdered or other person murder someone

1110
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,549
but then like the maximal thing will

1111
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:48,069
happen to you is you could lose your

1112
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:51,100
stake so like for certain things I think

1113
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:53,800
this may not work that well because like

1114
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:56,650
I'm I'm sure if like someone who used

1115
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,150
more their other person you know should

1116
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,350
use like love tokens probably the

1117
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,820
repercussions to the bigger than that

1118
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:05,680
but that's like a philosophical kind of

1119
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:09,400
discussion your focus seems to be on

1120
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,589
making the law cheaper and faster not so

1121
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,450
much on better outcomes so I'm wondering

1122
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:14,350
is there a possibility you're just going

1123
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,870
to increase

1124
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:18,580
disputes between people because that

1125
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:21,040
uncertainty that exists in the current

1126
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:23,410
court system so you may just weaponize

1127
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,410
the law system and so every little thing

1128
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:29,379
becomes like you've created a playground

1129
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,750
for criminals and bad guys to create

1130
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,670
disputes

1131
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:35,250
and take care of your system I'm just

1132
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,630
this is some bug in your system that

1133
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,390
could possibly be exploited

1134
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:42,180
think of the the Dow's originally and

1135
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,950
how they quickly were exploited by that

1136
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,348
guys and we ended up with aetherium

1137
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,569
rather than a theorem classic how do you

1138
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:49,859
see that it doesn't focus on so much on

1139
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:56,220
like better outcomes or is like a

1140
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:59,069
perception okay yeah yeah more focused

1141
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:02,160
on making the law cheaper and faster

1142
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:04,800
rather than trying to figure out how to

1143
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,529
mediate disputes in a like for better

1144
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,270
outcomes yeah I mean definitely better

1145
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,380
outcomes is like very very important

1146
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,330
it's actually like I would say number

1147
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,830
one thing I use focus on the other two

1148
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,330
because that like in a comparative way

1149
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,980
like I would say the court system we

1150
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:19,680
have to do a resolves like focuses on

1151
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,180
better outcomes a lot so I think the

1152
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,549
issues that it has is more like a run

1153
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,500
efficiency so that's why like I focus

1154
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:28,920
much on that compared to like the other

1155
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,960
stuff I think in there some outcomes we

1156
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,180
will you see how it works but I wouldn't

1157
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,950
necessarily say that it's gonna have

1158
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:38,490
like worse outcomes that the traditional

1159
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:41,250
court system like if any I think there

1160
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:43,470
is one core principle why they can be

1161
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:46,440
better and is that I've been like a

1162
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:47,730
global Court like I think the results

1163
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,650
are gonna be more like canonical and

1164
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,089
let's look out which may be like good

1165
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,320
for some cases are bad for others but I

1166
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:53,700
think in general for like I don't like

1167
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,970
freelancer in or stuff either is like

1168
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,348
nomads kind of thing is going to be okay

1169
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,089
so I haven't read your white paper so

1170
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:01,650
maybe I don't understand about the

1171
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:03,810
better outcomes but have you thought

1172
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,820
about the economic incentive if you make

1173
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:07,290
it cheaper and faster I think many of

1174
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,320
the reasons people don't enter into

1175
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:13,050
legal disputes is the huge cost yeah

1176
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,400
right and if you make it cheap to sue

1177
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:19,410
your counterparty you could create it a

1178
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,000
firestorm of legal descendants yeah I

1179
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:22,950
mean it's only the cost but also what

1180
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,619
you lose in the process like us take

1181
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:26,939
it's like the cost is obviously low but

1182
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:29,310
like this tech Jimmy pull is actually

1183
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,839
high like let's say interacting with a

1184
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:32,640
very important contractor of yours and

1185
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:34,650
you have like a huge stake of like a

1186
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,868
hundred K dollars then you may lose that

1187
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,430
in you like going to a into a dispute

1188
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:40,830
so you see have the incentive of like

1189
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,029
not going into a dispute I think what we

1190
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,950
are doing is community ties in it so

1191
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,640
certainly it will be easier if you want

1192
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,399
that you would leave

1193
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,569
literally create like a like a mistake

1194
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,819
of like $1 and then go into a micro case

1195
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:55,109
for like that $1 and I think maybe there

1196
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:57,450
is no much incentive to that because

1197
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,950
like the cost of like going through a

1198
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,140
process you know be bigger than like the

1199
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,939
door deposit that you put and yeah I

1200
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,200
mean it's kind of hard to answer how is

1201
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:08,369
this gonna work out with him we're just

1202
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:12,480
gonna see in like a few months so I have

1203
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:15,450
a question more about the quality of the

1204
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:19,609
ruling what are the mechanism to remove

1205
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:23,490
the bias of the jurors is there any or

1206
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:25,319
remove the bias yes so let's say I'm

1207
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:28,680
asking for ruling but the person that

1208
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:31,500
will be ruling could be biased in the in

1209
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,180
the outcome yeah so yeah there's this

1210
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,430
selling point mechanism where for

1211
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,230
example let's say you have like 21 euros

1212
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:40,890
or in your case you will need a

1213
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:42,240
majorities like 11 of them to rule for

1214
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:44,819
an outcome for the up going to be

1215
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,950
accepted so if there is just one that is

1216
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:49,680
various then that doesn't really matter

1217
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,629
so much if the 21 of them or like you

1218
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,160
know 11 or 12 of them are bias that's a

1219
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,200
different thing and you may have to like

1220
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,549
appeal to the next to the next round of

1221
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,990
viewers which is going to be drafted

1222
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:59,880
more and more yours and you have the

1223
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:04,200
whole network and so basically what you

1224
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:06,450
have to rely on or trust on is that 51%

1225
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,519
of this network is not gonna be biased

1226
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,200
and I think if they are global

1227
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,910
participants around the world like it

1228
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,558
the likelihood is that they are not

1229
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,819
gonna be biased but certainly it's

1230
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:16,380
something that we have to care of well

1231
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:18,299
like on board in Euros make sure that

1232
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,279
there are a lot of them and also that

1233
00:46:18,299 --> 00:46:25,769
they are pretty global in like four

1234
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:28,410
different backgrounds hi thanks for your

1235
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:31,379
talk is there a way you can bright

1236
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:35,399
jurors like in traditional systems with

1237
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:36,599
Jew bright Jewish I used yeah I mean you

1238
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,269
could definitely do that there is some

1239
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,619
there's an interesting mechanism which I

1240
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:43,078
don't know if I recall correctly but

1241
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:45,750
it's something like if you can predict

1242
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,309
the outcome or like the vote of a year

1243
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,589
or before it's settled you can like

1244
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:52,200
slash them so you can you don't you

1245
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:53,339
don't get that you can I prevent a

1246
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,098
little bit of that incentive of like

1247
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:57,950
then communicating beforehand but you

1248
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:59,660
can certainly bribe them the

1249
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,098
like that comes back to a national you

1250
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,359
can do like better Bryce because it can

1251
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:03,530
be like an own chamber I've like is

1252
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:06,259
literally like a smart contract brave

1253
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:09,260
kind of thing which there is no trust

1254
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:10,609
involved by the thing there is as I said

1255
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,559
before like if you have like 21 euros

1256
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:14,180
for example you will have to bribe 11 of

1257
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:15,589
them and even with that you can always

1258
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,720
appeal to the next to the next one so

1259
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:20,210
like you will end up having to buy 51%

1260
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:23,569
of all the network and even with that

1261
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:25,130
which is like kind of like full Turkey

1262
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:27,500
fork mechanism that I was sort of like

1263
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,880
talking about before which I mean I can

1264
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,619
go to be within in detail but basically

1265
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,720
it would create two different chords and

1266
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:34,460
then decide on the price of the native

1267
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,109
talking of the court in these two

1268
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,520
different courts what is the price that

1269
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:39,020
is higher and so the process higher you

1270
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,490
could assume that is the court is

1271
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,559
actually working because everyone in the

1272
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:44,180
system it's it's in because they believe

1273
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,040
that the courts will not work and so the

1274
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:49,430
price is higher you can basically use

1275
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,720
the bank they like shorter the like they

1276
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:53,750
like other fork and go in this direction

1277
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,040
so basically a tldr is that you will

1278
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,569
have to pay fifty one person of the

1279
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,400
network and even with that or dislike

1280
00:47:56,569 --> 00:48:02,960
Lazarus for the mechanism which is fork

1281
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:05,329
in it into two different courts you

1282
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,190
mentioned onboarding jurors so is there

1283
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:10,400
a specific process or is you just need

1284
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:11,630
to hold the token and bid you're right

1285
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,849
now I think will literally have like a

1286
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,190
mailing list for them to like sign up

1287
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:18,349
for news but then in December what we

1288
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:21,230
are going to have is this bonding curve

1289
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:22,849
so basically it is how to say this way

1290
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:25,430
in which are going to be able to stake a

1291
00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:27,559
and T so this Aragon Network token to

1292
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:29,509
get a NJ which is the RL network

1293
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:32,750
jurisdiction token which is like the the

1294
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:34,549
one that you wrote use and so we have

1295
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:36,410
like this - like isolate key iconic

1296
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:39,079
incentives like we don't know like like

1297
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:41,839
super weird different incentives so the

1298
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:43,339
you will be able to get like this this

1299
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:47,480
token that will allow you to be a usual

1300
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:52,308
basically in the network yeah okay so

1301
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:55,849
any other questions okay if not I would

1302
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:59,359
like to thank you at all for your for a

1303
00:48:55,849 --> 00:49:01,750
question and big thanks to Lewis for his

1304
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,720
interesting presentation and

1305
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:08,670
and comprehensive answer Thank You

1306
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,669
Ludlow's muchas gracias

1307
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:18,299
you
