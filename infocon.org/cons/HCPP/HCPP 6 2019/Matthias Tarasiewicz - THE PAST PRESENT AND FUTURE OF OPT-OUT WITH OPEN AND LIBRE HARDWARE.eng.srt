[Music]

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,730
is one of the leaders of Riyadh Vienna

4
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,899
based organization and I would say very

5
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,839
close one

6
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:41,519
in terms of values and program and

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,610
intends to pearl police so I'm very

8
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:48,510
pleased that you came and since

9
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:52,489
mattias is also a board member of open

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:57,199
hardware Association he's gonna present

11
00:00:52,489 --> 00:01:01,559
presentation about topic of hardware

12
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:07,759
Security trust and he's gonna take a

13
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:12,960
special insight into this problematics

14
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:17,600
in terms of recently running months of

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:21,210
open hardware so we're gonna talk about

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,509
trust and verification and other

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,419
security measures in hardware we trust

18
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,159
or do not so thank you much yes thank

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:35,100
you very much hello and welcome everyone

20
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm very excited to be here so my talk

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,658
is called the past present future of opt

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,820
out with open and Libre hardware and I

23
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,670
want to relate this a little bit to this

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,829
kind of ideas of crypto anarchy and how

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,719
we can actually regain to certain things

26
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,270
we might have lost already with hardware

27
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,039
with open hardware this all is also part

28
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,439
of the open hardware month so we are now

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,360
in the month of open hardware I will

30
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,158
explain a little bit initially what this

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,719
is about but first I want to give a

32
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,950
brief overview of what I will be

33
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,770
covering what topics we will be covering

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,299
today so we'll first contextualize a

35
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,160
little bit then I will give an

36
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,019
introduction to open hardware what is it

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,209
what is it for why do we need it and

38
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:14,370
also I will give a few example if you

39
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,290
tangible examples on how we can use that

40
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,660
to regain specific crypt anarchic

41
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,578
principles or attempts that we might

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,130
have lost already if we don't do so I

43
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:25,560
will look and briefly explain also why

44
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,019
this is important and why I open a Libre

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,079
Hardware can help us in this regards so

46
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:34,230
as I'm referring to a lot of different

47
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:36,030
projects and I'm always as your people

48
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,459
normally also from last year I'm having

49
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,890
a lot of hyperlinks in my presentation

50
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,079
I will also put these slides up again

51
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,950
this year on the right website so

52
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:51,359
remember riot 80/50

53
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,069
1:9 and I also want to point to three

54
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:56,099
other talks I've been giving already in

55
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,730
the past which are in this scope somehow

56
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:02,159
so there's one on the one hand the 30 to

57
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,469
c3 presentation on the amethyst axiom

58
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,200
open source Cinema Camera which you can

59
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:09,030
rewatch all these things on youtube

60
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,010
there was a transmitter jalapeno about

61
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,659
future factories in 2016 when I have

62
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,179
been participating which is also in the

63
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,970
context of my talk today and more

64
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,010
recently on monaro con 2019 I was Ben I

65
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,930
was speaking about critical

66
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,030
decentralization opening Libre Hardware

67
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,530
so this is also related so if you want

68
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,010
to dig deeper you can follow these

69
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:32,280
online links here the context of all

70
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,439
this is actually me first of all our

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,760
research designer and our project

72
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,629
developer I'm working with the riot

73
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,129
Institute but also I'm one of the board

74
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,560
members of the author of the open source

75
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,090
Heart Association you can contact me if

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,440
you're interested in any of these topics

77
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,930
that we'll be covering today especially

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,359
if you're working with crypto and open

79
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,829
hardware because we will be also doing a

80
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,409
lot of interviews and preparing a lot of

81
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:59,310
documentation and and and publications

82
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:00,840
in this context so um briefly to explain

83
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,909
what varieties so we are independent

84
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,069
Institute in Vienna based in Vienna and

85
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,470
Cyprus mostly and but we operate

86
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,149
globally and we are working specifically

87
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,400
with privacy technologies with open

88
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,489
hardware and with aspects of future

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,780
decentralization so in a way you can

90
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,239
find most of the stuff online so don't

91
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,899
want to cover everything here but we are

92
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,698
working mostly with documentation and

93
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,039
with actual tangible outcomes such as

94
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,780
publications so this is a recent

95
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:31,770
publication that we also distributed

96
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,559
here last year in the Institute here as

97
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,299
well and this was also for a longer time

98
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,250
available in the Mallory policies was

99
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,199
the last issue of the future crypto

100
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,240
economics magazine we are continuing

101
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,800
developing this and the next issue will

102
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,210
be about open hardware this is a older

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,700
book actually but still very very

104
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,380
relevant I was going through the aspects

105
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,659
of it and again rereading everything

106
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,159
and we covered maybe 10% of all the open

107
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,930
harder interviews we have been doing

108
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,760
with a lot of open harbor practitioners

109
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,950
in order to find out what are their

110
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,659
motivations why are they open sourcing

111
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,770
things that are usually kept private so

112
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,180
in technology and open source culture

113
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,979
especially in hardware you have a lot of

114
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,720
intellectual property rights and not so

115
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,850
many things are open as you would guess

116
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,270
and as we would know so this book will

117
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,830
also be in a special edition given out

118
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,020
and handed out tomorrow because we will

119
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,510
be also hosting a workshop tomorrow

120
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,370
together with riddling code so there

121
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,200
will be a few more left so if someone is

122
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,040
interested please contact us after the

123
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,240
talk yeah as I was saying taste October

124
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,490
open another month which is happening

125
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,230
right now and what does that actually

126
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,870
means so it means the Oshawa is

127
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,240
organizing worldwide events but not only

128
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,830
Ostra individuals hackerspaces people

129
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,660
that work in the field of open hardware

130
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,490
and they are also communicating

131
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,500
documenting and making this all a topic

132
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,860
explaining what is happening explaining

133
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,450
why the open source and also trying to

134
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,600
explain about the specific projects

135
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,770
there's the Oh hm 2019 hashtag and

136
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,230
Twitter where you can follow what is

137
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,120
going on globally and in case you are

138
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,530
from a harder background or you have

139
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,420
some event you can still post this

140
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,650
online so there's an ongoing list and

141
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,380
growing list of international events

142
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,090
happening there I want to briefly also

143
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,850
explain what they're authorized to open

144
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,710
source hardware Association so I won't

145
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,920
go through all the details here that are

146
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,440
listed here but this is the core

147
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,080
purposes and activities of the Ottawa to

148
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,750
all the organizers to educate the

149
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,159
general public and to collect compiled

150
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,460
and published data on the open source

151
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,080
other movement but in a way also to

152
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,520
document what is going on it's a quite

153
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,669
complex topic and I will briefly explain

154
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,250
also why this is the case so this is

155
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:44,550
maybe a very tangible thing that you can

156
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,050
browse through about the Oshawa or from

157
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,580
the Oshawa it's the certification

158
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,030
website there's a lot of different open

159
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,200
source hardware Association certified

160
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,539
projects online there

161
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,610
it's a directory online and you can see

162
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,790
a lot of different projects also some of

163
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,950
them I will be speaking about today

164
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,780
another very important thing is the

165
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,969
eastern open source hardware summit or

166
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,008
open how the summit which is happening

167
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:09,509
every year and this year it's not

168
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:11,809
happening so this is why we have to open

169
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,459
another month but this is very important

170
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:17,039
next year's event because this will be

171
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:19,259
the 10th anniversary of the open source

172
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,329
of the open hardware summit which will

173
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,789
be taking place in in New York Strip you

174
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:27,269
can already get tickets and reserve

175
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:30,779
tickets for that it's already poking out

176
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:32,459
very fast so I want to more specifically

177
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,139
also contextualize this whole talk and

178
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,360
everything we are doing here at HTTP

179
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,819
with something that we branded the open

180
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,349
hardware dialogues and I'm calling it or

181
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,059
we are calling it dialogues because we

182
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:44,789
found out it's a very good method for us

183
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:46,889
in order to learn and to understand and

184
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,549
to learn about new projects and also to

185
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:53,189
communicate so it's a very discursive

186
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:54,779
way also of our whole events that we are

187
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:56,969
organizing so that means we are

188
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,308
collecting a lot of knowledge and a lot

189
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:01,619
of content that we will be publishing at

190
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:03,719
a later stage you can find the current

191
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:04,889
program always on right at least less

192
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:06,808
open hardware because there's a lot of

193
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,569
things also that we are coming up with a

194
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:13,079
little bit last minute so a little bit

195
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:16,169
here details so at a CPP itself there

196
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,300
will be a few meetings and meetups today

197
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:21,149
I think is one and tomorrow we will have

198
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,759
a small exhibition or sort which is at a

199
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:26,159
hidden location not disclosed yet and

200
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,689
then we will continue also to Japan

201
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:29,399
blocks in a week when there will be an

202
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:32,939
additional program which is not entirely

203
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,349
released right now so the whole opened

204
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:37,228
how the dialog thing will then be

205
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,659
concluded with the C 3 with the annual

206
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,699
cause Communication Congress where we

207
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:45,149
will be publishing some so material and

208
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:46,769
some small print release and then it

209
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,509
will also be a larger release at the

210
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:53,009
open source hardware summit in New York

211
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:54,750
in 2020 but now to my actual talk which

212
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,300
is called the past present and future of

213
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,790
opt out with open and Libre hardware and

214
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,290
that one I actually start this with the

215
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,629
question and I'm not sure if everyone

216
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,370
understands what open hardware means and

217
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:08,009
to be more precise what open source

218
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,290
hardware means and in a way why this is

219
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:12,809
what's the problem why do we need open

220
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,550
hardware what is this for and I'm always

221
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:16,769
starting because I think this is the

222
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,859
right and very interesting publication

223
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:22,310
very has been put already very precisely

224
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,200
Jonathan Zittrain who was basically

225
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,790
pinning down the fact that consumers

226
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,850
have been shifting from generative to

227
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,860
tethered technologies this is how

228
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,839
Citroen describes it and what does he

229
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,540
mean with these tethered appliances or

230
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,610
tethered technologies so in a way our

231
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,430
hardware gets less and less repairable

232
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,899
you can interact with the hardware much

233
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,510
less than you could in the previous days

234
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,600
or in the previous decades and in in a

235
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:51,120
way this was a key principle or a key

236
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,560
idea behind hardware for a long time so

237
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,959
if we look for example at personal

238
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,119
computers and how this whole idea of a

239
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,969
personal computer started it was

240
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,680
actually delivered to be assembled by

241
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,959
the people at home so you would receive

242
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,819
some kind of mail order package you

243
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,469
disable the computer yourself and you

244
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,550
would be automatically tinkering with it

245
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,170
because you can assemble it in a

246
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,300
different way you can create it in a

247
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,430
different way you can extend it so this

248
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,709
kind of extendibility repairability was

249
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:20,160
a key principle of hardware back in the

250
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:22,380
days so um this is also relevant in

251
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,410
terms of cryptography because this micro

252
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,649
computing revolution as here arvind

253
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,449
naraneun and puts it was actually also

254
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:32,220
relevant because it brought back all

255
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:34,260
these kind of ideas that we finally

256
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,870
decided is of the cypherpunks of the of

257
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,939
crypto anarchy so we had encryption for

258
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,070
the first time publicly available which

259
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,050
was actually computable at home and not

260
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,940
at mainframes so this is 1 micro

261
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,219
computers have been ant American

262
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,110
computing revolution was super relevant

263
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,149
for this whole movement we have now but

264
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,750
at the same time the devices that we

265
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:57,320
have these days don't any don't look and

266
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,160
don't feel like these kind of original

267
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,589
devices of the micro computing

268
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,810
revolution so we remember how that

269
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:05,310
turned out after the micro computing

270
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,859
revolution so we had the crypto Wars of

271
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,739
the 90s where people smuggled out the

272
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,680
RAC source code on t-shirts and so on

273
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,810
this is an old story we know it all and

274
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,180
in a way to conclude the first point I

275
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,219
want to make closed devices reduced

276
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,959
technological literacy so we learn less

277
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,899
about these devices we have these days

278
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,670
and this is actually how Citroen puts it

279
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,410
this kind of problem with tethered

280
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,630
devices so you are basically locked in

281
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,130
into specific hardware on the example of

282
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,630
the iPhone you cannot even replace the

283
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,550
battery yourself without

284
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,279
maybe this drawing device or at least

285
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,990
voiding the variant warranty of it and

286
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,370
at the same time you don't know what is

287
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,500
going on you cannot control it you

288
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,050
cannot verify it it's it's a big problem

289
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,319
especially from this kind of Cryptologic

290
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,910
audience that we hopefully have so and

291
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:53,060
you cannot repair them it's actually

292
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,850
loose loose it's a win-lose situation

293
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:59,729
after all so um this this idea of this

294
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,610
right to repair is currently very much

295
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,709
debated and I'm also pointing here to

296
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,480
this repair or thought movement it's a

297
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:09,300
very strong debate that is going on in

298
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,250
the US right now and I suggest you you

299
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,800
check this out as well because it's also

300
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:18,329
having a huge enormous economic effect

301
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,069
if information about devices would be

302
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:21,839
available not only to the manufacturers

303
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,370
so to give you another example like

304
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,560
there is specific hardware that can only

305
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,540
be repaired by by the manufacturers

306
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,300
which is in my opinion a problem because

307
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,800
you have a third party you're trusting

308
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,079
you cannot repair this yourself and

309
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,060
ideally all documentation is available

310
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,888
to a lot of people that people can

311
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:44,008
create rip rip small repair shops or so

312
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:47,850
it has a definite definitely a economic

313
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:49,079
aspect as well so in a way also the or

314
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,649
repairing is a way of regaining

315
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,449
knowledge so as soon as you are touching

316
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,370
those devices and trying to repair them

317
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:58,229
you learn a little bit about these

318
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,480
devices so this can dis dis this

319
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,430
knowledge is repair knowledge it's very

320
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,620
essential to hardware development or to

321
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,839
hardware knowledge so in a way um

322
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,750
reverse engineering also is a very

323
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,220
important step and that means you have

324
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,100
to understand what kind of hardware you

325
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,810
have so that that means repairing it

326
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,139
could be a first step to regain this

327
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,719
kind of technological literacy this is a

328
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:25,410
very good book and I'm a big fan also

329
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,569
and Ruben anyone who is explaining this

330
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,490
also very good in his book to hardware

331
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:30,930
hacker and he explained some different

332
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,519
stories on how to reverse engineer

333
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,138
different approaches so this is a very

334
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,240
good starting point for someone who

335
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,009
wants to dig deeper into hardware

336
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,329
reverse engineering it's a very

337
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:44,610
recommended book interestingly also and

338
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:47,069
I loved actually what what what Bonnie

339
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,550
says here without the right to think and

340
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:49,380
explore

341
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,910
we risk becoming enslaved by technology

342
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,529
and tomorrow we exercise the right to

343
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,490
hack the harder it will be to take that

344
00:13:52,529 --> 00:14:00,810
right away so it's in my opinion super

345
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:02,820
important to also make sure that device

346
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,589
hacking opening devices checking what

347
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,600
kind of hardware you receive from a

348
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,480
verifiability perspective but also from

349
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,950
a from a educational perspective is an

350
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,829
integral thing it shouldn't be taken

351
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,140
away from you so there is still attempts

352
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:20,099
to make sure that you cannot repair or

353
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,930
open or kind of disassemble specific

354
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,790
devices as just cars and it's always

355
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,439
considered sometimes a security

356
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,969
principle that it's not repairable it's

357
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,640
a good thing in my opinion it's a very

358
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,660
bad thing because you lose the property

359
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,740
actually to verify what you actually got

360
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,290
open hardware in this context can

361
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,920
actually help regain this literacy and

362
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:42,719
here's actually I took this quote also

363
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,599
from this kind of official definitions

364
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,120
of open hardware so I'm because there's

365
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,709
not only the device itself verifiable

366
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,000
but you have specific properties of the

367
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:53,609
device such as the drawings the

368
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,560
schematics the design the material the

369
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,570
PCB layout data all of this is like open

370
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,920
source so you don't only learn about how

371
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,660
your device works and you don't learn

372
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,120
only how to validate it but you can

373
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,010
learn the craft and the skill that is

374
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,070
needed to in order to produce devices

375
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,720
themselves so there's a very good start

376
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,470
for people that are not so deep into the

377
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,240
open hardware topic this is called

378
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,899
building open source hardware and it's

379
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:22,529
written and edited by Alicia Gibb and at

380
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,720
all and I want to here also point to a

381
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,760
very interesting in article which

382
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,290
explains the difference between open

383
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,300
hardware and open software a little bit

384
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,980
because it's not the same things you

385
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,740
cannot compare it's entirely different

386
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,110
domain in a way so we have the fact that

387
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,579
Michael wild-like States is in his in

388
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,540
his text in this book that hardware is

389
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:44,849
born open so that means while open

390
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,480
hardware or while software with GPL and

391
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:50,190
CC licenses can be secured in a way or

392
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,800
you can basically control it more

393
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,380
granularly it's a different story with

394
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,670
with hardware because it's actually

395
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,439
falling under patent law which means

396
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:03,540
it's considered something useful or

397
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,680
thinks that to stuff on the other hand

398
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,810
cold and everything falls on the

399
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,370
artistic premises so that means it's

400
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,660
considered artistic work I find it

401
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,940
always interesting because you have to

402
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,589
so art cannot be useful or what what's

403
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,420
the problem with our society this is an

404
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:18,459
interesting aspect but from a legal

405
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,519
perspective this is the problem so it's

406
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:25,239
like not that easy to to to make sure

407
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,069
that nobody basically violates specific

408
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,889
rights that you want to give a specific

409
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:32,259
product so the way how this is usually

410
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:34,060
done in open hardware its trademarks so

411
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,290
very good example this context is the

412
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,239
other you know which is the trademark

413
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,500
and then then everything else is

414
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,850
released and there's a lot of other you

415
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,589
know clones but people would actually

416
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,980
remember the trade market you cannot use

417
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:47,709
the other you know trademark on your own

418
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:50,709
product there's also specific licenses

419
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:52,930
for this to tackle this specific problem

420
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:56,709
with open heart with actually that you

421
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:58,449
save your fine granularly make sure that

422
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,579
how is it actually used which is the

423
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:02,949
pepper license it's a kind of older

424
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:04,299
licensed and very famous one is the son

425
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:06,399
open hardware license there's the

426
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:07,689
version two currently drafted this is

427
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,189
online as well if someone is interested

428
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:15,250
and gplv3 is also sometimes used in the

429
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:18,010
context of open other designs so um

430
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,679
here's a very good quote also from

431
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,819
richard stallman who is explaining

432
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,579
basically the same facts that I have

433
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,139
just outlined so that he explains what

434
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,750
is the problem why is this not so easy

435
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,940
solvable and this is also a chapter in

436
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:34,360
our book open ISM conversations in the

437
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,919
open hardware so open source hardware

438
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,120
works differently than open source

439
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,220
software and a lot of new challenges

440
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,809
that can introduced and we have to face

441
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,750
them somehow when we are designing a

442
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:45,190
product or project so I want to give a

443
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,159
few examples because it might not be

444
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:50,130
tangible yet so I'm very good example in

445
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:52,690
my opinion about wireless routers and

446
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,980
this was a very important router in

447
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:59,260
terms of like open source movement

448
00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:00,700
because it's the Linksys wrt54g which is

449
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,210
said to be the best-selling route of all

450
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:07,120
times and actually this is important

451
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,830
because the open wrt murmur was actually

452
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,879
running on this computer could have been

453
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,620
developed because there was a lot of

454
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,280
information about the hardware available

455
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,320
so it was

456
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,240
licensed also partly under the gnu

457
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,720
general public license firmware we're

458
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:23,330
talking and in a way this actually also

459
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,130
was showing that it was a good attempt

460
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,590
because we have a lot of developments

461
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,970
and open wrt is only one of the

462
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,100
alternative farmers you can use on

463
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,660
routers and this is a variable example

464
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,980
in my opinion also because we can see

465
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,490
all the arguments that we'll be giving

466
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,960
in this talk on one kind of category of

467
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,600
products which is routers in this case

468
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,490
so you might be familiar with the

469
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,100
tourist omnia open other author it's

470
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,190
also very interesting project so this is

471
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,110
basically also only made possible we can

472
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,430
set this initial reverse-engineering and

473
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,879
availability of the source code of the

474
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:57,590
Linksys and and may be more radical

475
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,140
approach would be then the liberal CMC

476
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,699
which is a libre firmware so basically

477
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,730
this runs on a very limited amount of

478
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,910
devices only because the attempt of

479
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:10,610
Libre approaches versus open is that you

480
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,930
have no binary blobs in the drivers so

481
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,939
you can actually also make sure that the

482
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,340
software the drivers are not having any

483
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,430
back doors or any other information that

484
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,080
you cannot verify

485
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:23,270
another example is cameras there's a

486
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,669
long tradition in hacking cameras

487
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,780
because usually people are restricted in

488
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,120
what they can do with the cameras

489
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,430
technically though a camera sensor is

490
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,250
can be used for still photography or for

491
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:37,100
video photography so this is a very

492
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,640
interesting project chdk can on hack

493
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,679
developer kit which was actually a

494
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,570
community run project on trying to

495
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,400
reverse-engineer Canon cameras like very

496
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,260
simple current cameras for photography

497
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,990
use of for extended use for photography

498
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,960
and more popular approach was the Magic

499
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,840
Lantern project maybe it's more well

500
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,180
known already which basically enabled

501
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,699
people that were filming with this

502
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,650
cannon based cameras

503
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,060
DSLR cameras and to use an individual

504
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,760
firmware that was giving them basically

505
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,470
pro usage for that view you would

506
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,660
usually have only in very expensive

507
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,760
cameras so it's not pin also very

508
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,500
important project and then this would be

509
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,090
like the most radical approach and also

510
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,770
project we have been working with and I

511
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,449
have been also presenting at the c3 the

512
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,150
apparatus open source Cinema Camera

513
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,220
which is a completely open hardware

514
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,540
camera so that means like every part is

515
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,910
as open as

516
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,770
it's possible so in this case I won't go

517
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,660
into the details you can see the thought

518
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,690
online but the idea is here that you can

519
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:38,300
basically modulate or like control

520
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:42,440
extent and so on the software and the

521
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:46,159
hardware at maximum liberating for us or

522
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,620
to say so I wanna here actually propose

523
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,840
three different opt-out possibilities

524
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,629
that we have with open hardware today

525
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,340
you saw them first would be to actually

526
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,740
open up the hardware through reverse

527
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,080
engineering in order to verify that

528
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,470
means in a specific security setting but

529
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,000
also for own sake and not to be paranoid

530
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,880
here but there's a lot of hardware

531
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,890
implants of course existing in devices

532
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,900
this would be an opt-out basically

533
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,400
another opt-out in my opinion is to

534
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,850
create alternative firmware and I will

535
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,350
give a tangible example in a second to

536
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,969
add features that they have but that

537
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,889
didn't have in the first place in order

538
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,560
I mean if you take this from a radical

539
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,810
perspective you could also even in my

540
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,429
opinion create the future opt-out

541
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,760
Society by complete completely

542
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:34,370
decoupling your information and

543
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,770
communication methods with hardware and

544
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,179
the third part being to create open

545
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,120
source rather yourself this is a long

546
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,550
and a very long task and also as we see

547
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,620
as we saw the apparatus open source

548
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,820
Cinema Camera can take years so in the

549
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,520
example of the camera

550
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,000
it took over 12 years to have a first

551
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,220
functioning program their project there

552
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,740
so the problem though is whether maybe

553
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,830
hopefully explained in a way that people

554
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,530
could understand this tethering of this

555
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,149
ecosystems is a big problem so it's not

556
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,649
only hard which is tethered it's it's

557
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,080
not only that you cannot repair your

558
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,670
your hardware anymore it's also the

559
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,129
problem that the software cannot be

560
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,840
changed so this is due to some two to

561
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,780
the fact that the manufacturers want to

562
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,189
keep you in this kind of end-to-end

563
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:23,540
situation where you're using all sorts

564
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,920
of ways that they can actually profit on

565
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,930
on any step that you're using their

566
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,550
hardware so however usually comes

567
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,410
bundled with software it's no way that

568
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,659
you without reverse engineering can

569
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,310
install your own firmware there are few

570
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,500
examples tour that I will show in a

571
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,700
second and and usually the problem and

572
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,740
the limitation is that there's no

573
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,790
documentation about it you have to do a

574
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,800
lot of work and

575
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,560
usually for the regular person it's too

576
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,470
much work so enter device liberation

577
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,330
alternative farmers it's a huge huge

578
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,860
field in a huge culture and I just

579
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,780
picked a few examples to show you why

580
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,810
this is important where it works in my

581
00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:00,110
opinion so usually you start with having

582
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:02,750
some kind of hardware that actually

583
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,459
analyzes the any part or every part of

584
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,500
the of the hardware you want to look at

585
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,750
so this is a very famous one is the bass

586
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,040
parrot which actually has specific

587
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,480
properties that you can actually find

588
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,520
out okay what is the device what is the

589
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,350
protocol here at stake what is how is

590
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,180
the device communicating with my

591
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:19,399
computer how is it communicating at all

592
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,650
and so I can actually little bit find

593
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,590
out more about the device this is a more

594
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,850
less or less known device which in my

595
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,260
opinion is a little bit better than the

596
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,240
bass parrot so in case you're doing

597
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,129
reverse engineering take a look at this

598
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,240
it's the shock here oh it's cold and you

599
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,370
can find this on and it's a lot of

600
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,570
information about this device it helps

601
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,189
you with all this kind of pitfalls

602
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,740
because usually people start to build

603
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,910
their Arduino breadboard thingy and

604
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,400
there's a lot of other things and it

605
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,660
will be slow so there's a few existing

606
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,990
devices where you can actually speed up

607
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,760
the process in reverse engineering

608
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:53,180
alternative firmware to create this kind

609
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,580
of secure animal communication as in

610
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,280
vision pattern cypherpunks and as has

611
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:02,149
also mentioned in this crypto anarchic

612
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,770
manifesto is regaining my opinion by

613
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,350
reverse engineering and by regaining the

614
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:08,260
control over devices and I want to give

615
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:11,449
here very tangible example I mean nobody

616
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:14,210
worked on this there's a huge community

617
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,440
working on this project but I think this

618
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,240
could be extended we could use this

619
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,100
already and if someone is like up for

620
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,930
some hardware hacking then this is a

621
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,709
very good thing to start so this is a

622
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:28,040
very cheap walkie-talkie handset handset

623
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:32,030
so you can basically communicate with

624
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:34,580
people over FM on different technologies

625
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:36,800
and basically this is a Chinese knockoff

626
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,720
thing is like hundred twenty bucks and

627
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,460
you can buy this it's by Travis good

628
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,770
speed at all and it's on a non key tab

629
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,480
and the good thing it's cheap it runs

630
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,770
already alternative firmware so I don't

631
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,720
have to reverse engineer it is a

632
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:50,060
community of 60 or 80 people already

633
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,040
reverse engineered the whole thing and

634
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,629
it's easy to build upon so what comes to

635
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,190
mind is for example to create some

636
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,779
channel

637
00:24:54,190 --> 00:25:00,730
being a public/private key SMS function

638
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,230
on this thing or also to extend it with

639
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,970
some other communication system but this

640
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:08,139
would be like an and non internet usable

641
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,000
communication system of the cypherpunks

642
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:12,279
theoretically it's very advanced you

643
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,690
should really take a look this is

644
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,100
another good example because I like it

645
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,580
because it's such an easy heck so

646
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:21,428
there's the Osmo FL 2k processor which

647
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,860
can be used from multiple applications

648
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:27,970
so this is a completely documented chip

649
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:29,830
and it's basically easy usable for

650
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,899
software-defined radio basically you can

651
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,549
do a lot of things we totally find radio

652
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:35,799
because you can create everything that

653
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:37,990
sends things and trend transmits things

654
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,970
it's just limited on there on the

655
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,379
amplifiers and other hardware parts you

656
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,700
use but bass is a very good starting

657
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:45,668
point and the good thing about this is

658
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,279
it costs $5 so there's also already a

659
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:50,889
huge community around this this hardware

660
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:53,769
and the interesting thing is this comes

661
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:57,008
mostly in this kind of USB 3 VGA

662
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:58,929
adapters so there's a few interesting

663
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:00,340
buying guidelines online how you can

664
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:02,799
actually find them you can spot them on

665
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,879
eBay for may be cheaper than $5 the

666
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,908
interesting thing is you could easily

667
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:09,959
build with this for example your own

668
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:11,830
dvb-t pirate radio or video or

669
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,610
television station or something you

670
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:17,529
could spoof gsm base stations in a

671
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,439
second you can do some management Miller

672
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:22,629
tech it's a very good sisters

673
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,490
penetration tool as well in my opinion

674
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:26,019
is a very good starting point is a vast

675
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,929
amount of documentation online about

676
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:30,909
this device so I want to give you also

677
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:33,580
some two other examples where open

678
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:36,129
hardware actually helps with specific

679
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:39,789
opting out of specific elements that

680
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:42,250
were in a way not verifiable on that saw

681
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:44,919
specific elements of verifiability of

682
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,629
centralization that come with all with

683
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,639
device centralization so basically we

684
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:51,219
are trusting a lot into Apple or

685
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:53,080
specific manufacturers in that they give

686
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,940
us the devices didn't they don't

687
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,129
introduce backdoors into the hardware

688
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,720
and software so there's two very

689
00:26:57,129 --> 00:27:00,610
interesting examples which are

690
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,200
identified which explain a little better

691
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,830
why I think open how they make sense in

692
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,160
this context so one project that I think

693
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,270
is really interesting is the safecast

694
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,070
organization they started the crowd

695
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,440
signs Geiger counter which was called

696
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:17,379
another how to pronounce this be guy gay

697
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:21,010
or something it's unsafe cast organ it

698
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:23,710
basically looked like this and it's a

699
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:26,230
Geiger counter so you can actually make

700
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,630
sure to you can identify radiation

701
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:30,760
levels and this was actually used um in

702
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,890
order to verify the information that was

703
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,990
given out after the Fukushima incident

704
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,090
in Japan so people would actually

705
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,290
crowdsource this information will

706
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,060
actually crowdsource what they are

707
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,530
measuring and then would make this data

708
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,750
available and they were there was

709
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:46,240
different researchers who first of all

710
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,380
had access to this data and secondly I

711
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,820
could actually then compare this

712
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,050
information to the information that has

713
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,090
been given up by the government which

714
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:54,550
was different to be honest this is all

715
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:56,350
evident now and we can see how there has

716
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,000
been misinformation are going on and

717
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,580
it's a very easy example how you can

718
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,230
basically opt out of this information as

719
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,419
symmetries basically you are creating

720
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,860
your own truth you know designing your

721
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:09,640
devices and then you can actually affect

722
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:12,280
check the situation another very very

723
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,630
interesting example and this is a talk

724
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,340
that was given on the 34c 3 which is

725
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,930
called vintage computing for trusted

726
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,649
radiation measurements and a world free

727
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:26,440
of nuclear weapons the very interesting

728
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,910
talk Constanza just to see the talk but

729
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,650
this is also interesting from a

730
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:31,360
cyberpunk perspective I mean not that

731
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,300
I'm saying like we have possibly a

732
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,729
nuclear war hopefully not but the

733
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,520
problem is that there is a specific

734
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:43,620
problem to solve and related to trust

735
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:47,110
that they have with disarming nuclear

736
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,580
warheads and the problem is in order to

737
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,229
disarm you need to confirm the

738
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,560
authenticity of these warheads they have

739
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:56,680
an individual unique radiation signature

740
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,360
and the problem is that this information

741
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,430
and most of the validation that is

742
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,020
needed in order to disarm it involves

743
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,210
multiple parties to say ok this is the

744
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,760
correct word and it's actually and now a

745
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:11,050
disarming it when you need specific time

746
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,940
a lot of simultaneous verification and

747
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:15,850
the problem here starts that let's say

748
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,500
we have a another five large parties

749
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,620
that have nuclear warheads at the end

750
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,540
they have some certain

751
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,459
kind of understanding how to disarm you

752
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,159
have to make sure that a certain party

753
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,470
and party B has hardware that can be

754
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,240
trusted at the same time so I delete

755
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,030
these people create their own hardware

756
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,900
and this is where open hardware comes

757
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,129
into play this is a very good

758
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,140
interesting scenario is a very

759
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,960
speculative scenario because due to my

760
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,880
knowledge nobody yet uses an open

761
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,520
hardware to disarm but we should disarm

762
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,520
maybe open Hado can help them and this

763
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,740
paper basically solves and tackles a lot

764
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,600
of these questions and has open hardware

765
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,660
as the answer in order to disarm nuclear

766
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,320
warheads so an interesting choice on

767
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,610
hardware was the Apple 2 board why did

768
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,309
this use this kind of vintage part

769
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,350
because it's completely documented it's

770
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:07,200
very easy to verify you basically can't

771
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,629
can't do anything wrong it would be

772
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,610
accessible after of the sale market so

773
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,340
let's say you would get it in China you

774
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,350
would get it in in in any part of the

775
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,959
world probably might be okay Apple could

776
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:21,510
have built in some kind of backdoor back

777
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,240
then but it's it's so verified that you

778
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:27,629
can easily measure every part of this of

779
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,429
this support and so this original Apple

780
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,620
tool was extended with a few

781
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:32,850
custom-designed open hardware elements

782
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,530
that would be needed for this nuclear

783
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:37,139
disarmament and these are like new

784
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:40,678
produced how the modules for the Apple

785
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:43,110
tool so another hint to a possible

786
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,700
project would be why don't we use these

787
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,770
sorts of devices this very far but

788
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,290
devices to create keys we're all using

789
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:51,240
like very new hard well on the example

790
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,309
of even the crypto hardware wallets that

791
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,290
are there might be back those in the

792
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,960
chips test but there's even basically

793
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:00,360
documented backdoors in the in the chip

794
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,270
so why I thought it was like hard when

795
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,800
like that to create our master keys or

796
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,480
something like that so there's a lot of

797
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,129
applications in my opinion from a

798
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,640
cyberpunk perspective or from a crypto

799
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:13,800
market perspective well we can actually

800
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,450
we could not look at new devices but

801
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,090
look at mintage devices that could

802
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:22,440
actually help them in order to recreate

803
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:25,970
a trust so the solution would be to use

804
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,950
vintage very for the hardware in

805
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,330
combination there's a type with

806
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,040
open-source hardware that's that's

807
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,189
always good so the verifiability is good

808
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,139
but also open source

809
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,570
doesn't mean that the components are

810
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,940
always verifiable so I would have to

811
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:43,720
extend this by saying verifiable open

812
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,430
hardware what is the relevance to

813
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,410
Krypton to the rest in this context and

814
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:50,700
the system because I would say most of

815
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:52,810
you are crypto enthusiasts Hardware a

816
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,230
random number generator this is a good

817
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,909
example so I'm it's randomness this is a

818
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,140
huge topic it's a large debate and I

819
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,570
don't want to go into the details and I

820
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,210
don't want to debate about it but I'm a

821
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,770
big fan of how a number generators I'm

822
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:08,440
collecting them I love them it's amazing

823
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:11,410
and it's just a few of them which I've

824
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,570
also finds like visually appealing this

825
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,980
is maybe more interesting more in my

826
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,169
opinion because it's a libre hardware

827
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,420
but what is libre hardware and what is

828
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:24,030
open hardware so again if we look at the

829
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:26,260
router from worse it's ideal if you have

830
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:28,149
verifiable open source hardware and if

831
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,590
you have also software that doesn't run

832
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,750
any binary code on it

833
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,070
binary blobs so to say so you can

834
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,080
actually check ok it's the software

835
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,149
possibly having a backdoor no it's the

836
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,280
hardware impact along and basically the

837
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,940
problem still and the limit is the

838
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,770
hardware because there's very very few

839
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,830
undocumented or or there's very few

840
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,930
fully documented chips out there so for

841
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:55,000
example to give you a context in most

842
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:56,860
modern-day CPUs we have we have mimics

843
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,650
operating system which is started you

844
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,929
know there could be all sorts of things

845
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,880
the while there wouldn't be kind of

846
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,470
large dot and theta exploits possible

847
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,450
there could always be like meta data

848
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,160
leakage for example and this is a

849
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,810
problem especially if we look at like

850
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,990
privacy driven cryptocurrencies where

851
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:15,790
you secure the complete software stack

852
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,650
but then the hardware is there is the

853
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:21,010
weak points and this is a big problem in

854
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:22,420
my opinion so entering hard well it's

855
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,640
what is of course also problem because

856
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,110
this is and I picked those three

857
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,640
different harder bullets out of the

858
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,820
reason they have a very very different

859
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,710
I'm a trust approach so on the left hand

860
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,540
we see the tracer which is an open

861
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,090
source hard which is verifiable because

862
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,649
I can actually check ok what what is

863
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,959
built I can rebuild it I can write on

864
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,150
another device basically it's it's it's

865
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,830
it's using standard components are

866
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,630
completely verified in the middle we

867
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,460
have the beat box which is partially or

868
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:51,220
only because it uses open-source

869
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,020
software but has an HSM so I have to

870
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,970
trust how the security modules have to

871
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,110
trust the manufacturer of the harm

872
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,650
security model that there's nothing

873
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:00,909
wrong with that and on the on the right

874
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,770
hand side you see the ledger which is

875
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,450
completely closed so this is like very

876
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:06,129
interesting to see are we really happy

877
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,870
with these devices me personally I'm

878
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,820
only happy with with the left one and

879
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,009
the problem is still okay to a trust I

880
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,679
am enough for their specific implemented

881
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,870
chip so I would love to have an Apple 2

882
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,290
to host all my keys to be honest just

883
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,759
saying at least with the treasurer we

884
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,649
have the opportunity to build our own

885
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,590
devices around this hardware so that's

886
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:28,839
already a step forward in my opinion and

887
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:32,050
to conclude this what I've been showing

888
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,560
you in this in this kind of marathon so

889
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:37,510
I was actually arguing that open

890
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,879
Hardware creating open heart would be

891
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:42,129
also a potential opt-out possibility but

892
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:44,049
it is hard you cannot really create

893
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:45,520
Hardware yourself so fast it's a lot of

894
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,290
knowledge you need to know this

895
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,969
knowledge has been or this potential has

896
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,668
been taken away from us by actually

897
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:53,529
closing down hardware much more so a

898
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:55,690
good start is to learn and to really

899
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:58,120
reverse engineer and to take apart the

900
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,940
things you have lying around at home or

901
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,580
in the office in this context I'm gonna

902
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,500
also refer to projects in Russia will be

903
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,340
taking place here at HTTP it's the

904
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,040
Blessed command

905
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,200
it's an kind of a reverse engineering of

906
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,029
an open-source build count of a bill

907
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,529
counting machine in order to figure out

908
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,970
how to use this potentially for the

909
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,850
Lightning Network it's in order to

910
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:20,470
create a light network ATM it's a very

911
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:23,529
interesting project I was talking with

912
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:25,899
the creators also and also the

913
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:29,080
development is easier when you use in

914
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:31,930
your designs and existing fully

915
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,750
documented components so on the example

916
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,549
of the fresco logic FL mm chip that I

917
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,910
was pointing out before it isn't most of

918
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:41,290
this kind of USB 3 VGA adapters this is

919
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,120
a good starting point because you can

920
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:45,370
it's there's a huge community behind it

921
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:48,880
and it's very documented so it's also an

922
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:50,770
easier way to learn is a way to start in

923
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,120
situations where you have to verify and

924
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,770
where this is actually crucial for your

925
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,390
organization or what is this crucial for

926
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:58,060
you because you are storing a lot of

927
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,960
bitcoins on your devices you should use

928
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,640
the specific components

929
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,160
part of your design it's it's crucial in

930
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,990
my opinion and in especially in Syria

931
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,790
trust situations as we saw with the

932
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:11,660
nuclear disarming it's a kind of a

933
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:14,839
different scenario even so here we have

934
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,399
to possibly make sure that we find

935
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:20,480
alternatives so we can actually verify

936
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,599
the hardware again so especially also

937
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,030
when I was pointing out here this

938
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:28,070
alternative crowd-sourced radiation

939
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:29,810
counter it's interesting to see that

940
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:32,210
these kind of products also work I was

941
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:33,500
thinking that this is a is a problem and

942
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:35,510
that people would not rebuild this but

943
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,940
this is a lot of people are using these

944
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,839
kind of devices so this is also

945
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,119
important to understand that we can

946
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,430
solve other issues by understanding and

947
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,599
relearning and and regaining this

948
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,919
knowledge that has been taken away from

949
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:51,500
us so in a way and maybe I didn't argue

950
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,140
this enough open and verifiable hardware

951
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,680
can help to create the crypto anarchic

952
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:59,839
principles but also to somehow not

953
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,790
completely give up on all these kind of

954
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,770
ideas of the zero trust society because

955
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,060
I like the approaches and one of them

956
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,030
also criticizing this on some other

957
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,940
planes I think we have to investigate

958
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,680
what this kind of hardware is available

959
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:15,740
technologies offer us what they can what

960
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,149
they can help us create and these

961
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,220
devices are still missing there's not

962
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:21,550
not a single device out that completely

963
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:24,230
functions where people are communicating

964
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:26,599
really secure and unmonitored as

965
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,400
envisioned in this Cryptologic manifesto

966
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,530
so these devices would have still to be

967
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,950
built so I hope someone actually takes

968
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:35,990
on these ideas 'm I was just presenting

969
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,580
so again also to stress the fact about

970
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,200
the Libre Hardware debate I don't know

971
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,060
if you're not so familiar with it please

972
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,069
take a look it's a very huge debate

973
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:45,070
online so there's even a

974
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:51,200
program actually from the FSF resort

975
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:53,750
foundation which are specifically rates

976
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,189
hardware or basically tells you which

977
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,589
kind of hardware is more liberal than

978
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,910
others so there's a large list online

979
00:37:57,589 --> 00:38:01,070
where there's existing hardware that you

980
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:03,250
can use so if you're in working in

981
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,460
cryptography or working with with

982
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,200
sensible

983
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,000
sensitive data then you should take a

984
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,160
look at this list and comprise your

985
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,720
hardware stack or like make sure that

986
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,848
your hardware stack is comprised of

987
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:18,250
these elements

988
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:21,140
so usually in in kind of harbor security

989
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,910
situations when like high trust

990
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,500
situations people would use for example

991
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,480
this kind of old hardware the problem is

992
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,480
this is the last hardware that is

993
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,869
verifiable from a mobile perspective or

994
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,180
like a portable perspective it's a the

995
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:38,420
ThinkPad X 200 is super old I'm also

996
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,000
using this this myself but the problem

997
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,890
is this is slow so you can use only very

998
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,190
limited graphical features but the

999
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:48,109
problem is how father we want to bring

1000
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,210
the whole verifiability and in my

1001
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:52,130
opinion there is also the problem

1002
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,079
because a lot of people are looking at

1003
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,829
purism right now what I love what they

1004
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,530
are doing and I think they're very

1005
00:38:54,829 --> 00:39:01,099
important addition to this home security

1006
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:03,109
and privacy debate all the hardware and

1007
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:05,569
especially the CPUs they are using are

1008
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:07,848
showing us a lot of different exploits

1009
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:09,950
it's not that it's not pure isms fault

1010
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:12,859
at all it's actually an Intel problem so

1011
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,470
we see in other recent spectra meltdown

1012
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:17,270
and so on incidents that are ongoing

1013
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:18,709
that this is just the beginning you

1014
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,910
cannot really fix this with a software

1015
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:22,520
app that this is actually part of the

1016
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:25,279
hardware so you're basically in a

1017
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,809
way so there's a lot of side channel

1018
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:29,539
attacks there's a lot of it's always the

1019
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:31,549
same kind of security problems that we

1020
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:33,289
have with these devices so and what I

1021
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:35,809
think purism is going into the right

1022
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:38,480
direction we are not at the level of

1023
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:40,099
verifiable Hardware at all right now and

1024
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,650
this is this has to be solved we have to

1025
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:45,160
solve this this yeah thank you so much

1026
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,160
for my talk

1027
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:53,850
and I'm gonna completely don't know harm

1028
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:59,130
timewise because I'm so concentrate this

1029
00:39:53,850 --> 00:40:03,930
so time yeah we still have even time for

1030
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:05,040
questions and there is and thank you for

1031
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,589
your talk

1032
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,040
basically it falls from your talk that

1033
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:12,480
there are three levels of hardware where

1034
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,360
it can be opened

1035
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,570
basically it is cheap itself which is

1036
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,370
integrated circuit the assembly of the

1037
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:22,950
board with the multiple chips

1038
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:26,460
potentially and the firmware can you

1039
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:28,319
just bid elaborate on the because I

1040
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,660
assume that the chips are the hardest

1041
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,600
part or the story is there any way to

1042
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:36,000
verify that an actual chip is

1043
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,700
corresponding to the open documentation

1044
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,730
and how the chip can chips themselves

1045
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,319
can be open hardware I mean yeah very

1046
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,120
good question thank you and basically

1047
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,520
this is the ongoing debate as well and

1048
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,040
we are on the verge of having open

1049
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,660
silicon which is a in its kind of

1050
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,029
beginnings

1051
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:56,220
some people might know that risk five

1052
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,230
and all this kind of different kind of

1053
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,149
really open silicon that is on the verge

1054
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,200
of being like released currently we are

1055
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,090
in the state that a lot of this

1056
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,439
proprietary hardware is really not

1057
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:09,450
verifiable this is true so a lot of t's

1058
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,160
so I could be potential other vectors we

1059
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:13,740
don't know about this is a very good

1060
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,230
point and we have to still work around

1061
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,240
that our technology's not fine off but

1062
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:21,330
in the future and we will see this very

1063
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,149
soon hopefully we will have very cheap

1064
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:26,819
available risk 5 of course open silicon

1065
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:29,400
that you can completely verify yourself

1066
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,370
until then we have to work around that

1067
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,810
and we have to work use old and vintage

1068
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:36,240
machinery in order for our cryptographic

1069
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:38,880
context it's a problem especially in in

1070
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,109
cryptography unlike very in in a way

1071
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,760
this is also reason why specific there's

1072
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,650
hardware limitations and the whole

1073
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,150
crypto economy crypto economic

1074
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,250
principles are working around harbor

1075
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,720
limitations the whole cryptography is

1076
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,520
based on that there is not a quantum

1077
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,290
computer available then recent news we

1078
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,360
saw also that there might be potential

1079
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:59,400
speed ups and specific things that were

1080
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,050
building our security model around this

1081
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,960
might be around the corner we don't know

1082
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,180
but

1083
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,430
as soon as we cannot verify the pair

1084
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:11,200
hardware were using I think we are even

1085
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:14,140
more attackable hello thanks for your

1086
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,169
talk on the topic of vintage father

1087
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:21,700
there was a recent announcement of a

1088
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:26,349
cubes or as certified Lenovo ThinkPad X

1089
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:28,919
230 that runs coreboot I mean it's at

1090
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:31,630
least a bit more modern than the X 200

1091
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,970
there's a lot of debate about coreboot

1092
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:36,670
or liberal boot and I mean core boots

1093
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,890
has its specific limitations and you

1094
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:42,839
will see all the debates online I don't

1095
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:45,310
want to judge here but there's a lot of

1096
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,779
interesting team members at the co-op

1097
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:50,650
boot team just to say the least

1098
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:52,349
you have to look it up yourself thank

1099
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:59,890
you and another question

1100
00:42:52,349 --> 00:43:01,150
ok I really like what you're doing and

1101
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,109
so I don't want this question to be

1102
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,940
misconstrued as like not really into it

1103
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:09,430
but like short term from a pragmatic

1104
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:14,410
approach is there a group of people

1105
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:15,848
looking at how do we sidestep these

1106
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,529
issues so for instance I think the

1107
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:20,800
purism project they have like the

1108
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:22,930
microphone Killswitch what is in the

1109
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,900
same vein as that because that seems

1110
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:29,020
like eminently doable and maybe there's

1111
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:32,859
ways that we can sort of trick or step

1112
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:34,480
around what we perceive as barriers it

1113
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:37,270
depends on which devices you're looking

1114
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,250
at but I would say privacy and

1115
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,440
specifically this privacy awareness is a

1116
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,880
huge market so there's not only purism

1117
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,810
there's a lot of other projects as well

1118
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,599
so little phones are very are coming

1119
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:51,220
there's a lot of prototypes out they're

1120
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,570
not super developed but purism is really

1121
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:56,140
doing a good to step in the right

1122
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:57,880
direction it's a tip I'm amazed how fast

1123
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,759
they were actually producing the product

1124
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,380
also um last year the HDP peda was what

1125
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,050
we were giving a talk about the prison

1126
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,880
system I really like what they are doing

1127
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:08,560
but it depends on what kind of model

1128
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,080
year we are looking at so there's of

1129
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,750
course attempt in specific cryptographic

1130
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,160
Hardware or like other wallets well that

1131
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,470
should be made like more open

1132
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:21,359
I would say this kind of things exist in

1133
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:23,589
every sector you just usually don't

1134
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,720
really see it because they don't have

1135
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:27,670
this kind of huge PR budget and they

1136
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,348
don't have a lot of advertising but

1137
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,729
there's a lot of project out there so

1138
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:33,009
usually in this kind of enthusiasts

1139
00:44:30,729 --> 00:44:37,509
communities you find a lot of projects

1140
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:39,789
like that especially I mean to end to

1141
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:41,589
really reach end-users this is this is a

1142
00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:43,779
tough thing you need a lot of firm to

1143
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:45,328
raise a lot of money you need to put a

1144
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:48,130
lot of money in your hand to have like a

1145
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:49,690
huge PR budget but there are a lot of

1146
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:53,769
projects out there I don't know where to

1147
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:58,630
start even there's a lot of them we

1148
00:44:53,769 --> 00:45:03,640
still get questions thank you for your

1149
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:06,819
talk and I was wondering if not FPGAs

1150
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:11,489
would be the best candidate you know for

1151
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:14,440
a hardware which is so a chip which is

1152
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:19,890
you can use it you can program anything

1153
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:23,710
on it so the problem if you have the HDL

1154
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:26,680
description you cannot trust the

1155
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:30,579
manufacturer that he does not temper the

1156
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:33,308
HDL yeah also true I mean the problem is

1157
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:35,529
like what are we talking about because

1158
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:37,739
this would be like a very specific use

1159
00:45:35,529 --> 00:45:40,450
case where you can use it an FPGA

1160
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:42,729
usually people want to use operating

1161
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:45,249
systems like Android or Linux or

1162
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:47,140
something on devices this is like where

1163
00:45:45,249 --> 00:45:48,819
purism steps in for example so this is

1164
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:51,160
actually soft in specific things where

1165
00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:52,719
we just want to create keys or solve

1166
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,578
specific issues then we can of course

1167
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,769
use specialized hardware although that

1168
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:59,140
it's always introducing another risk or

1169
00:45:56,769 --> 00:46:01,988
any another unverifiable 'ti into the

1170
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,640
game so I didn't get into detail about

1171
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:05,910
that but it's a very good question why

1172
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,170
don't we use and look at other

1173
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:11,379
implementations or other technologies at

1174
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:16,359
all I don't know why actually I mean you

1175
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:18,260
can you can there's nothing that stops

1176
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:23,029
you to program

1177
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:25,970
you know x86-compatible instructions

1178
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:27,770
that see me one on fbj yes very good

1179
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:30,589
point so and then you just have to

1180
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:33,050
verify the fpg and if the FGB is

1181
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:36,470
verified i mean under microscope

1182
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:39,310
whatever then you can do anything on it

1183
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:42,049
very good let's do it

1184
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:48,049
thank you very much some other questions

1185
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:55,889
please if not so thank you very much yes

1186
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:55,889
[Applause]
