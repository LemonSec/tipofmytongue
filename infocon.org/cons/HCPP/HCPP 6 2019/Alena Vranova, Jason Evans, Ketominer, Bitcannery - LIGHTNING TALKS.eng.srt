[Music]

3
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,720
hello there let me welcome you to

4
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,650
another session of lightning talks and

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,070
our first speaker at this session is

6
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:40,589
Jason and Jason is a training engineer

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,250
with SUSE Linux which is super cool

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,110
because these days there are Linux days

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:49,710
this weekend and he chose to be here

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,510
instead of Linux days so I'm really

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,239
happy that you were here and he will

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,489
tell you something about running tour in

13
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,260
containers which is something that I try

14
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,659
to do so many times but it's not that

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,839
easy so I hope I finally learn something

16
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:10,850
so Jason let me hand over to you looking

17
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:12,830
forward to a talk thank you oh all right

18
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:18,149
good afternoon

19
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,590
nobody Oprah that name and today we're

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,380
going to be talking about building poor

21
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:31,350
services quickly and securely using

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:33,960
containers all right so what is tor tor

23
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,070
is a free software and open network that

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,000
helps you defend against traffic

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:42,809
analysis so if we can get a new one all

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,820
right it's on now great so basically

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,560
this is a long description from the tour

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,298
website

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,950
what does tor really tours and anonymity

30
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:54,950
security and privacy network now I

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,270
imagine most of you have heard of tour

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,140
maybe many most of you have probably

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,569
used it now the reason we used horror is

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,009
we want to ask a few questions do you

35
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,350
want corporations to see what you do on

36
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,270
the Internet

37
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,190
do you want your government or any other

38
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,200
government to see what you do on the

39
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,210
Internet

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,920
do you have any opinions beliefs or

41
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,950
ideas that someone might find offensive

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,489
I think some of you might have heard

43
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,600
recently in the UK there's a bit of loss

44
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,970
put out where you can actually have

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,920
called a plea on somebody who offends

46
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,330
you now offense is completely subjective

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,359
what offends me might not have been the

48
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:40,050
next person but your opinions can be

49
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,110
policed tor helps us

50
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,680
protect ourselves it's used by

51
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:50,360
professionals journalists activists

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,230
bloggers law enforcement executives

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,210
whistleblowers whistleblowers is a big

54
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,910
thing your company does something wrong

55
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,970
you need to be able to safely say what

56
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,520
it is without retribution and normal

57
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,500
people normal people who care about

58
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:09,180
security we care about be anonymous on

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:12,450
the internet but it's got problems it's

60
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,790
got bad neighbors every year you hear

61
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,880
about more and more places like child

62
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,560
pornography websites on the on tour this

63
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,019
is this is just the fact this is how I

64
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,780
do it how it is and therefore it's got a

65
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,060
bad reputation there's a lot of people

66
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,600
who don't want you to use tor one

67
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,190
because they don't like the anonyme of

68
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,320
it if they think you should not be

69
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,600
anonymous on the Internet

70
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,930
it's also got a bad reputation because

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,840
so I'll give you example on the

72
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:45,120
paralleling polis Facebook group I asked

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,240
a few months ago does parallely Pulis

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,280
have a tor mirror immediately someone

75
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,810
responded why we're not doing anything

76
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,280
illegal well it doesn't matter the fact

77
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,230
is that you want to be able to be

78
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,420
anonymous and you want your users to be

79
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,190
able to be able to visit you anonymously

80
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:07,589
also we can help change the face of the

81
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,240
Tor network we can encourage security

82
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,430
and privacy advocates to end-users to

83
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,920
harness the power of the network we can

84
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,019
encourage nonprofits nonprofits not just

85
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,729
companies like our organizations like

86
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,760
instituto crypto our anarchy and

87
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:24,570
parallely proneness but also bloggers to

88
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,810
be able to publish on tour as well as on

89
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,340
the free all open Internet you can also

90
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,030
build your own onion service nowhere

91
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,090
that's what we're going to talk about

92
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:40,650
today so what isn't

93
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:42,090
tor tor isn't the dark web what our

94
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,070
onion services onion services are

95
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,880
basically websites that live on the Tor

96
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:50,010
network they are not accessible on the

97
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,820
open Internet unless you use unless

98
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:57,030
somebody uses like a special proxy lie

99
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:00,300
web to tour or toured a web but normally

100
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,340
you can't access them so we're gonna

101
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,520
just give it some basic idea of what

102
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,979
this how this works so Michael has a

103
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,390
website he's got a normal open Internet

104
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:16,020
what a website Alice comes to visit his

105
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:18,360
website but he can't identify her to him

106
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,159
she is just another user he can't see

107
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,810
where she comes from he can't see any

108
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,230
kind of statics about her unless she

109
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,820
chooses to give that but Alice can't

110
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:31,010
identify Michael because he it's on the

111
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:34,880
open Internet yon can't identify Alice

112
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:37,200
whenever he's running an onion service

113
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,810
because again she's just an anonymous

114
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,950
person Alice also can't identify yon

115
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,800
unless he specifically gives that

116
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,120
information this is important thing to

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,700
know because this is different than

118
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,530
normal internet normal internet person

119
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:57,180
goes to your website you check your logs

120
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:58,380
you see their IP if you do it who has

121
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,330
looked up you can see who owns that

122
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,820
domain this is the normal internet there

123
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,700
really is no not an anemone you can work

124
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,880
on it you can make things more difficult

125
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,640
but you don't have an anonymity

126
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,840
how do containers filled in all of this

127
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,419
we're gonna talk about docker containers

128
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,469
specifically a container image is a

129
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,750
lightweight standalone executable

130
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,790
package of a piece of software that

131
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,880
includes everything needed to run it

132
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,410
code runtime system tools libraries etc

133
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,010
it's basically a mini operating system

134
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:32,030
that lives in a file that's a little bit

135
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:35,039
simplistic but that's really what it is

136
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:37,619
that this allows us to run able to run

137
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,790
multiple engine services at once you

138
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,080
don't have to know how to set up the

139
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,930
individual pieces you don't need to be a

140
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,930
system admin to be able to set up an

141
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,000
onion website with containers and you

142
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,510
can focus on your content not on the

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,540
administrative tax tag that

144
00:06:50,510 --> 00:07:00,740
administrative tasks here's a quick

145
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:00,740
demonstration we've got a demonstration

146
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:13,110
yeah missing the slidin okay so we do

147
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,319
have a demonstration it's not here right

148
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,439
now

149
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,389
so basically whenever you you can do go

150
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:24,319
to github you can do a git clone of one

151
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:28,159
of my one of my scripts you do docker

152
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,389
docker compose up

153
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:33,869
wow that's completely gone docker

154
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:36,179
compose up - deep and what we'll do it

155
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:37,769
was a will compile torrents from source

156
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:39,839
that way you know you're getting the

157
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:42,329
latest version and it is downloading it

158
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,189
from from upstream all of this is

159
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:46,439
completely invisible are completely

160
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:47,639
transparent not invisible completely and

161
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,559
transparent so you can see that you're

162
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,089
getting the real tour from the real

163
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:53,849
upstream source and as you and you're

164
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:55,499
always compiling the latest version then

165
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:58,679
it just brings up your service

166
00:07:55,499 --> 00:08:02,249
I've got services first for generic lamp

167
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:04,349
services services for WordPress for

168
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:07,439
whatever we're uh whatever framework

169
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:09,628
that you want to use and since this is

170
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,489
all open source it's very very easy to

171
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,319
look through it's easy to build your own

172
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:18,709
once you've got once you've got the

173
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:23,189
actual process of on how to do this down

174
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:26,939
so how so this is how will we use

175
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:29,849
containers today demonstration so here's

176
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:36,959
a look at our docker compose file come

177
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:40,468
over here we're going to be building our

178
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,149
code from from from source we're gonna

179
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:45,300
be using a local volume which means it's

180
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:47,490
basically a place to save it we're gonna

181
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,500
be adding an array DB database in case

182
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,379
we want some actual databases to run

183
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,819
with it and then we're going to be

184
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:58,529
building lamp which is a lamp stack

185
00:08:53,819 --> 00:09:02,790
which is going to be PHP my sequel Linux

186
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:04,500
Apache my sequel PHP and then docker

187
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,379
compose up and it's done

188
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,310
this script is all you need to be able

189
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:12,430
to print or

190
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,459
oh here's my here my demo okay here it

191
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,209
is

192
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:20,649
alright so we're gonna do a docker

193
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:23,949
compose up - D it's gonna pull down the

194
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:36,279
latest version of Martin or ADB and this

195
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:38,079
is not sped up this is real time so as

196
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,079
you can see it's in this case I had

197
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,939
already pre compiled a lamp and torch

198
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,859
just for the sake of we don't want to

199
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:46,389
spend ten minutes here and use up the

200
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:51,370
entire time for my lightning talk

201
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:53,170
so dr. exec - I T then the name of the

202
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,959
container then this little script I

203
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,209
wrote called beef III onions and there's

204
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,619
your onion address and that's it put

205
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:02,498
your site's up you don't need to do

206
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,850
anything else of course this is just a

207
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:06,279
plain lamp stack so you'd still need to

208
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,410
you know have some actual content there

209
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:12,730
but that's all you really need in order

210
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,209
to build build Oh onion site it's time

211
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,949
to act

212
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:17,979
opt out of surveillance it's time to

213
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:19,959
decide I don't want people watching what

214
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,990
I do on the internet I want to share my

215
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,489
ideas even if they are crazy even if

216
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,430
they're offensive even if somebody

217
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,709
thinks that I'm absolutely no we want to

218
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,430
be able to share those ideas and we

219
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:36,489
don't want anybody telling us we can't

220
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:41,319
here's my tour project.org and then

221
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:43,990
here's my gift my github and on Friday I

222
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:47,579
shirts some symport stickers I hope

223
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:51,089
somebody got some of those and that's it

224
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:51,089
thank you very much

225
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,250
guys we have a minute for some questions

226
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:07,420
if you have yeah I'll give you a

227
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:10,030
microphone second hi thanks for the talk

228
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:15,339
my question is what are the real risks

229
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:18,130
of like using tor and being the exit

230
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,960
node of someone else and having troubles

231
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,600
because the activity of someone else

232
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,890
having like a false positive it is a

233
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,470
huge risk

234
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,030
there is the Tor project has an entire

235
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,250
page of things that you need to be aware

236
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,650
of if you run an exit node you need to

237
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,850
have a legal identity you need to be

238
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,560
able to have some kind of legal

239
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:40,420
representation from when this happens

240
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:42,160
there are special special mailing

241
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,099
mailing lists that you can join to help

242
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,569
with that there's a big risk especially

243
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,080
if you live in the country like United

244
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:53,500
States and especially Germany now middle

245
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,360
notes or bridges relatively safe because

246
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,330
they're pretty anonymous but exit nodes

247
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,430
you got to be careful and what about

248
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,820
Rozsival deniability when i have exit

249
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,709
node and you know doesn't that give it

250
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,600
to me like both of it in a little thing

251
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,970
can I say that I didn't do it you know

252
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,960
and you can that doesn't mean they're

253
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,200
not gonna take our computers in the

254
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,630
meantime so you still have to go through

255
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,700
my cell had to go through a trial I mean

256
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,320
it's it's a big deal okay thank you for

257
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:28,759
a dog okay

258
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:28,759
[Applause]

259
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:37,680
okay so thank you Jason and our next

260
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,329
speaker is Elana Renova so you know we

261
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,939
need some gender equality

262
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:44,150
normos and stuff so Allan is here no no

263
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,670
Allan is really cool girl

264
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm joking nice awesome girl she is

265
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,750
she's actually one of the founders of

266
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,390
satoshi labs and and what's your topic

267
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,970
today how to write a book in four days

268
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:59,220
and publish in 14 that sounds great yeah

269
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:04,430
okay Allen now so let me hand over to

270
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,430
you and enjoy honest talk thank you

271
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,220
thank you everyone

272
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:14,189
so I want to share some experience that

273
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,780
I made recently when I co-authored a

274
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,490
little bit coin book I'm not going to

275
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,740
talk about the book please feel free to

276
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,290
buy it here and and just read it

277
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,260
afterwards but you know I'm not a huge

278
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,620
brighter I can read a little but

279
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,630
actually sitting down and writing along

280
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,150
Texas has always been a problem even my

281
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:37,200
my thesis took me many more months that

282
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:38,850
he's supposed to be and so because we we

283
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,460
wrote the book in four days I thought

284
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,260
you know a lot of people were like how

285
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,440
did you do that and how did you do that

286
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,600
with eight people on the table so I want

287
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,760
to open source the experience it's by

288
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,550
far not perfect and we made some

289
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,010
mistakes but I hope I can you know give

290
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,709
you a little bit of the knowledge you

291
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:01,110
know since I'm in Bitcoin these are just

292
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,940
a few of the questions that I had when I

293
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,600
started and then people keep repeating

294
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,320
right and so when my you know mom

295
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,020
canceled

296
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,530
alena what is this Bitcoin I was always

297
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:15,750
frustrated that there's no simple tiny

298
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:18,630
resource that would give a basic

299
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,330
framework to you know your family and

300
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,700
friends about like why actually Bitcoin

301
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,100
matters and so there were books great

302
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,880
books but too much you know economically

303
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,490
technically heavy so I was frustrated

304
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,070
and I always wanted to have a book and I

305
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,830
want to show you an itinerary or a list

306
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,240
of things that you can just basically

307
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,880
follow

308
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,890
and try to write your book because I'm

309
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,590
sure you have a lot of information in

310
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:49,770
your brain that deserves to see the the

311
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:52,170
paper right and second thing that you

312
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,050
need to for this is a team because

313
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:58,110
writing solo means that you don't have

314
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:01,020
the peer pressure writing solo means

315
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,330
that you can spend 12 18 24 months

316
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,250
sitting and editing and thinking and

317
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:09,030
thinking and thinking until you go crazy

318
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:13,250
right having actual peer pressure is

319
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:16,350
great and also having compatible Minds

320
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:18,930
incompatible skill sets so you can see

321
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,940
the authors are like you may know Jimi

322
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,790
song he's a programmer and he's teaching

323
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,710
programming Bitcoin there are people

324
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,630
like Alex Gladstein who's from it a

325
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,700
human rights foundation so he is

326
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,250
passionate about the why is Bitcoin

327
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,890
important for human rights they're

328
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:37,170
business developers venture capitalists

329
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,560
people who have studied Stanford and

330
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:43,380
Harvard and all these like super

331
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,319
superduper schools people that can do

332
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,230
illustrations such as Louise who did all

333
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,780
the beautiful pictures in the book and

334
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,090
so we we put ourselves together and each

335
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,550
of us had a little bit different

336
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:59,070
motivation so my motivation motivation

337
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,650
was to have a simple Q&A book that

338
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,770
answers the let's say top 100 basic

339
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:07,709
questions about Bitcoin but Jimmy wanted

340
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,750
to get new developers excited right

341
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:14,220
people that code but they don't know

342
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:16,950
about Bitcoin and Lilly or Alex

343
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,110
Lloyd they wanted something for VC's you

344
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,320
know to answer like to put really the

345
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,510
basic framework and so in order to

346
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,480
achieve that we decided to put even more

347
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:31,350
pressure on ourselves so one is limited

348
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,670
space to be in one place because all of

349
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,440
the authors are from a different

350
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,510
continent we're actually from five

351
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,490
different continents which also is

352
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,550
problematic with the time zones and you

353
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:45,810
know scheduling stuff and the green so

354
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:48,750
being in one place actually helped us to

355
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:51,060
be focused to be like a boiling pot it

356
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,590
also allowed us to you know go me

357
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,839
spending my time on

358
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:57,780
swimming-pool someone else was hiding in

359
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,330
their room and we were able to reconvene

360
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:03,120
once or twice a day to just you know

361
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:06,030
discuss stuff that's was there was not

362
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,700
clear I hope you appreciate the sticker

363
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:12,599
of of Alex on his laptop

364
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:15,630
so this looked great and then we also

365
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,089
limited our time because you if you

366
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,850
don't have a specific deadline then you

367
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,919
know how it is you know we all finish

368
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:25,439
will finish and eventually you keep

369
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,480
postponing and I'm saying that we

370
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,070
brought it in four days actually we we

371
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,400
brought it in even smaller time frame

372
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:35,760
and there was no preparation upfront so

373
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,160
we did not discuss particularity

374
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,760
we only knew and I was a common goal

375
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,590
that we want to produce a simple small

376
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,930
easy-to-read book that would explain why

377
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,270
Bitcoin matters right that was the only

378
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:51,960
thing we pre discussed so nobody came

379
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:54,510
like with the you know contents or stuff

380
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,030
like that so that day one was planning

381
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,740
than the two days was really iterative

382
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,899
writing and I will touch on that a

383
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,780
little bit later and the last day was

384
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,930
really anything so it's easy to read and

385
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:09,690
there's no serious errata although there

386
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:14,400
are some still but basically this was

387
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:16,350
this was the thing and so when we

388
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,050
started here the planning the day one

389
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,990
the first thing we started is to each

390
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,730
one describe your target audience and

391
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,310
each one had a completely different

392
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,830
person in their minds I wanted to write

393
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:31,290
something for my mom they wanted to

394
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:34,080
write something for students or visas

395
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:36,510
but that was important to just put it

396
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,300
out there and then we were testing

397
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:43,560
ourselves so we were playing playing

398
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:46,350
basically role-playing I was my mom okay

399
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,419
and I had some basic questions like

400
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,990
isn't this illegal his government gonna

401
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:55,200
turn it off and then we basically flip

402
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:59,580
the rolls and answered or gave a review

403
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,950
of after reading this book now I know so

404
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,710
what my mom feels and would say after

405
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,330
reading that book so we knew mentally

406
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,170
where I need to get from

407
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:11,850
and towards that makes sense and each

408
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,130
one had a different perspective and

409
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,770
that's fine we you don't necessarily

410
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,240
have to agree about okay we're gonna

411
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,870
write it for Elena's mom

412
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,780
yeah everyone has his target audience in

413
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,669
mind and makes sure that everything

414
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:31,760
that's written down is comprehensible

415
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:36,570
for that particular person so how we did

416
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:40,910
was the date continued when we had this

417
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:43,770
clear we started to plan the content

418
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:46,530
what I did okay I lied a little bit

419
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:50,070
about the preparation I wrote some

420
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:52,139
questions on the flight to California to

421
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,929
the house I was sitting on my flight and

422
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,520
I just put together a huge list and some

423
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,160
of the other guys they put their

424
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,580
questions there recently or frequently

425
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,670
received and so we had roughly 75

426
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:09,659
questions in the neck so she that we

427
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:12,990
brought on little post-its and then we

428
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,510
started to just you know put them on the

429
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:18,510
wall and assemble them into logical

430
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:22,080
boxes and eventually we came up with

431
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:25,110
chapters in the structure and with a

432
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,600
plan and the plan looked like this this

433
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,449
was a board that we shared and we

434
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,020
basically each of us started with one of

435
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:36,480
the chapters and after I wrote a chapter

436
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,410
for example the foreword that's Elena

437
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,960
that's me

438
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:43,730
first one then someone else came and

439
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,910
took the first chapter and rewrote it

440
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:49,230
okay and in an interactive way

441
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:51,600
eventually each of the eight authors

442
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:55,710
went through the same through through

443
00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:00,000
all of the chapters okay now we were not

444
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:02,310
polite we were not you know commenting

445
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,410
and suggesting and asking do you mind if

446
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,540
I change the wording because the

447
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:10,440
principle number one is this is a group

448
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:13,440
ownership okay we have a goal and we

449
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,350
cannot nitpick or we cannot fight over

450
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,230
the wording and you also need to kind of

451
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,250
give up some you know ownership and

452
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,580
there was a

453
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:27,140
a lot of different political views we

454
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,879
are not all voluntaries libertarians or

455
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:32,310
anarchists at all so everyone was kind

456
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,040
of seeing a different angle and so it's

457
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:37,500
super important to not feel ownership of

458
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,540
the chapter that she wrote or the the

459
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,030
part that you wrote because in the end

460
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,850
what matters is the outcome as a whole

461
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:48,450
and so instead of like being polite you

462
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:51,480
just go and rewrite the chapter that

463
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,780
you're reading by keeping the most

464
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,880
important stuff adding what's absolutely

465
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:59,940
necessary for understanding deleting

466
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,520
redundant stuff right and generally just

467
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:08,240
making sure it's easy to read and that

468
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:11,520
the flow is is nice what we did not have

469
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,670
instead of except for a good numbering

470
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,950
is an editor on the thing and that's

471
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,590
that I advise you if you if you want to

472
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,380
try this approach really to find a

473
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:25,020
professional editor because none of us

474
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,990
is skilled in writing except for Jimmy I

475
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,300
think is skilled in writing books and

476
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,790
how to narrate a book how to use you

477
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:36,510
know ask them they those are like

478
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:41,909
stylistic things that that would benefit

479
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:45,060
heavily from having an editor public the

480
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:47,340
last day took basically all the day we

481
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,669
were preparing the document which was

482
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:53,129
written to make it formatted well and it

483
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,990
was like a lot of work for Louise

484
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:59,280
because Louise Buenaventura he was the

485
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:02,040
one taking care of that and tell a story

486
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,200
like that's that's one thing that you

487
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,250
know we are heavily in the tech space

488
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,560
and we are pretty much used to read

489
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:14,970
white papers and technical stuff right

490
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:17,610
but our target audience is not so we try

491
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,070
to open the book by telling stories and

492
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,129
putting the framework and you can do it

493
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:27,090
with actual storytelling or you can you

494
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:29,550
know use use pictures okay that's funny

495
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:32,399
formatting and I think Louise has done a

496
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,409
great great job there as well to make it

497
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,610
somehow nice

498
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:40,250
that's an option okay tools well I

499
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:42,530
should not promote Google but I do

500
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:45,800
because it's just great for

501
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:48,139
collaborative writing so we use that and

502
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,450
then of course InDesign and illustrator

503
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:55,220
for the cover also procreate which

504
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:58,310
helped in creating those little

505
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:01,520
illustrations pretty quickly and then

506
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:05,000
the publishing process itself so we were

507
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,850
in a discussion whether to self publish

508
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
or to go with the publisher going with a

509
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:14,179
traditional publisher is better in the

510
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,240
form of like okay they should make sure

511
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:20,300
that you and your book lands in the

512
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,370
actual stores and maybe globally right

513
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,980
but it takes months and months and

514
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:27,379
months so we want it to be fast heavy

515
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,810
done and after leaving the house knowing

516
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:33,110
that it's going to be available on

517
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:35,330
Amazon in just a few days so we chose

518
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,659
Amazon because Amazon just really did a

519
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:41,810
good job here it prepares it helps you

520
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:44,000
prepare when you go to to the Kindle

521
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:47,899
direct publishing there's a cover

522
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,120
creator a converter it basically a tool

523
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,390
that helps you do the DTP work that

524
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:56,989
otherwise would take someone else quite

525
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:59,030
some work we finally after playing with

526
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,710
those tools they're still not perfect

527
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,540
okay be ready

528
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,840
don't don't think that it's gonna happen

529
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:09,350
like that because in the end we ended up

530
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:14,600
just converting everything to CSS using

531
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:19,399
markdown and then exporting to to the

532
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:21,889
final files and you create your profile

533
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,500
on Amazon author central if you are like

534
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:28,130
more authors everyone has to have his

535
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:31,130
own author account with Amazon and then

536
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,980
you basically connect the authors to to

537
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:39,050
the book and if you want to create an

538
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:41,780
audiobook amazon also has this tool to

539
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:44,330
that allows you to upload mp3s

540
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,100
we are working with guys one and I know

541
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,649
if you know this guy he's

542
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:52,639
one of my favorite podcasters he's

543
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:55,490
trying to make me stop he's doing a

544
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,430
crypt economy podcast reading a lot of

545
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:02,300
Bitcoin related stuff so make sure you

546
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:04,970
read the ACX conditions because they

547
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:08,720
have pretty much high bars for the

548
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:10,580
quality of the recording so I hope this

549
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,530
will be helpful and I'll skip this

550
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,980
because the work never ends we're trying

551
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:19,310
to get the book translated then if you

552
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:22,880
want to help either share the book or

553
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:24,290
send some funds or just contact us if

554
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:38,900
you want to help with the actual

555
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:41,810
translations thank you so did you notice

556
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,940
how Alan I came to stage in the room is

557
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,590
suddenly full allowed it okay Alan ah

558
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,830
thank you for a talk it was lovely

559
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:51,620
and our next speaker is Pavel who is

560
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:56,949
representing multi-national more

561
00:26:51,620 --> 00:27:01,100
dysentery that development group of

562
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:03,620
project bit canary and he's kind of a

563
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,240
sad kind of face of this over this

564
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,520
project and it is pretty cool it is

565
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,590
about a lock you can encrypt itself

566
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,690
encrypting stuff into blockchain which

567
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:14,270
which is having it we used in Bratislava

568
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,920
to prove a corruption and I think this

569
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,020
is a really cool use case and we will

570
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:24,350
tell you more about it so Baba

571
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:28,580
it's yours is this thing on can you hear

572
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:31,490
me oh nice so great advantage to speak

573
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,260
about after Ilona I have the room full

574
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,060
otherwise I would have like five people

575
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,240
I guess so thank you for being here and

576
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,940
especially thanks to parylene polis and

577
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,140
uri and pavo for inviting me and given

578
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:48,350
me this opportunity to tell you about

579
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:51,200
our project so this is my favorite

580
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,490
picture but let's start from this one so

581
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,500
don't you just hate it when your

582
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:57,740
imprisonment imprisonment imprisoned by

583
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,990
a government or by some other body and

584
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,840
all your digital assets

585
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:07,450
or all your things you want to you know

586
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:10,000
keep safe getting the wrong hands or

587
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,780
when you suddenly die because

588
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,960
unfortunately despite all the nights

589
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,520
nice talks we had recently in parallel

590
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,770
Nepal is about extending your life

591
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,080
expectancy and stuff we're all but

592
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:25,929
Dustin's one day we will just perish and

593
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:28,970
I think personal freedoms also involves

594
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:31,880
this degree of responsibility when you

595
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,830
think about the moment when you not in

596
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,090
charge but like how to stay in charge

597
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:40,220
which when you're not around so think

598
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:43,399
about this for a moment like what kind

599
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:46,250
of strategy you have for the this moment

600
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,429
when you're not around anymore so this

601
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,890
is our solution we've created a system

602
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:55,340
called bit canary it allows you to keep

603
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:57,590
your secret on on the blockchain and not

604
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,879
in very specific implementation it's a

605
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,220
theorem but we're not buying it to this

606
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,300
video we can use any other smart

607
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:08,300
contract and part compatible blockchain

608
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:10,070
this system allows you not just to keep

609
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:13,760
your secret on the blockchain it's

610
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:17,300
delayed publication so in a nutshell it

611
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,690
works like this when you so you're an

612
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:24,230
Alice you have a secret you put it on a

613
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:27,350
chain using one key and another key is

614
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:30,559
split between custodians code keepers

615
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:33,740
and you perform periodic check in which

616
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,770
can be whatever action which requires

617
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:39,559
your authorization but in our case is

618
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:41,900
just send an ether to a smart contract

619
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:43,520
so while you check in in everything is

620
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,620
fine and your secret is on the chain and

621
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,059
nobody can access it but then when

622
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:50,030
moment comes and you missed your

623
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:52,639
check-in so again that's this is how you

624
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,830
usually miss your check-in because you

625
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,890
just cannot be there but then what

626
00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:02,720
happens is your secret is decrypted

627
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:06,140
custodians provides the the parts of the

628
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,840
key and then secret can be accessed to

629
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:12,730
whoever has the sequence the second key

630
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:14,409
your trusty so this is this is system

631
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:19,120
sorry sorry for skipping the science

632
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:22,270
starts this is like system described

633
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,159
like only on one foot so since I still

634
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:29,850
have couple of minutes I can go in

635
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:34,000
specifics we use as I said a theorem and

636
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:36,610
smart contracts we use two keys one is a

637
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,650
symmetric another symmetric the this

638
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:42,939
symmetric is split between keepers and

639
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:45,250
we use some kind of hybrid approach

640
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:50,040
there is there are product projects like

641
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:53,650
Dark Crystal or recent trees or Shamir

642
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,740
secret backup which is very cool we also

643
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:59,140
use Sameer by the way but in systems

644
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:03,669
like Dark Crystal for example you elect

645
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:05,679
your custodians you pick people who you

646
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:09,190
trust like your relatives your friends

647
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,660
your whoever and then you give them the

648
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:13,600
parts that should discharge of your

649
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,030
secret this is working up to a point

650
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,370
again if you really like if you person

651
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:21,190
of the high profile then finding new

652
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:23,168
families really it's quite simple and

653
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,419
like you can enforce your family and

654
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:28,630
friends in the same manner as you can

655
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:32,980
enforce yourself to disclose your secret

656
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:36,210
but if you have apart from your family

657
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:39,250
and trusted keepers you have also some

658
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:42,610
economically incentivized keepers simply

659
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,530
put notes like you can you can beekeeper

660
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,530
in our system you can run a note on your

661
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:51,790
on your computer in your cloud and just

662
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:53,918
earn money or an ether just you get this

663
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,200
effort for keeping somebody else's

664
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,910
secret so in this case you have fine

665
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,750
balance between people who incentivize

666
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:04,690
by social bond and between people who

667
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:09,540
just incentivize by money which is good

668
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:13,720
enough we think but no but there is end

669
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:16,178
so this what we suggest you suggest you

670
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:20,220
opt out from centralized services

671
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:23,799
obviously notaries human agents

672
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:26,049
centralized password storages it's just

673
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:26,920
amazing how many people still use Google

674
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:30,280
Docs or

675
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:33,190
Gmail for keeping secrets there I know

676
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,740
of a very sad story some friend of

677
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:38,800
colleague of mine great photographer and

678
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:42,460
artist he deceased last year and nobody

679
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,560
can access his Google Drive and the

680
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,420
family tried to access Google Drive and

681
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,210
get his pictures his artworks from the

682
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,920
Google Drive and Google reply sorry we

683
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:53,130
don't care your family it's personal

684
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,860
information there is no process for that

685
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,600
that's all so that's I think it's not

686
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,669
good it's not good enough again for

687
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,879
people who really care about freedom

688
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:06,340
like freedom of the time when you're not

689
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,140
there is really important so the most

690
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,360
important part why I'm here

691
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,840
this project is in Maine net but it's

692
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,060
still not production ready and we

693
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,310
eagerly looking for for the feedback

694
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,000
from the community we want this code to

695
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,820
be audited

696
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,330
we want this DUP decentralized

697
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:27,879
application be tested it's there it's on

698
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:33,570
the website you just need a browser to

699
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:36,580
access it and some ether some test ether

700
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:38,379
to play with it please drop us a line

701
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,300
tell us what you think about that we

702
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,920
just want to build something which is

703
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,649
useful we're also looking for

704
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:47,500
partnerships so to be part maybe some of

705
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:49,600
some wallets it will be really I think

706
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,780
useful integration same goes for our

707
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:57,310
keeper node it can be useful addition to

708
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:59,290
any hardware node so just be in touch

709
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,750
that everything it's just application

710
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:04,870
it's not really interesting but it's

711
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,640
yeah it's how it looks so drop us a line

712
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:09,040
be in touch and tell us what you think

713
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,520
about the project that's all I have

714
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,520
thank you

715
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:23,750
we have time for one or two questions so

716
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:26,510
if you have yeah in your diagram I saw

717
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:29,059
that the secret was first encrypted with

718
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,889
your key and then encrypted with this

719
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:33,500
key that gets shorted it does that mean

720
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:35,480
it's encrypted with both it's yes it's

721
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,579
encrypted with both it so if you're

722
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,799
taken away basically it's still

723
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:42,649
encrypted twice and it can't be

724
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:45,619
decrypted with sharded so given that

725
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:48,888
given the assumption situation like as a

726
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:52,490
use case let's assume he has a trustee

727
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:54,530
and this trustee has a symmetric key so

728
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:57,049
the secret is encrypted with the public

729
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,819
key of trustee and then with this

730
00:34:57,049 --> 00:35:01,700
symmetric key which is charted between

731
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:03,259
keepers so when common moment comes and

732
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:08,029
you skipped and you miss your check-in

733
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:10,670
you need to construct to reconfirm the

734
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:14,500
keepers and then also use your trustees

735
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:16,579
key because otherwise if keepers can

736
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,410
theoretically gather together and then

737
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:22,609
just decrypt your the keeper secret

738
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:25,009
given the right incentive does it answer

739
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:25,960
your question okay maybe one more

740
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:38,420
question

741
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:41,329
anybody oh yeah I mentioned that to keep

742
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,130
us will change over time because even if

743
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:46,069
the incentive is economically maybe

744
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,540
someone drops out server dies how do you

745
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:49,750
manage cavitation in that case

746
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,099
absolutely yes this is one of the

747
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:54,079
weakest point of current design because

748
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:56,780
right now we do so-called keep your

749
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,020
rotation that's code exactly that so you

750
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:02,960
need to reconstruct your contract and

751
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:04,790
GAE bring Eddie's back online to get

752
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,589
secret again so this is really a

753
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,660
cumbersome procedure so you cannot do it

754
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:10,308
automatically so we were thinking about

755
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,910
design which you allow some you know

756
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:15,650
some very very generous threshold for

757
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:18,078
keepers so you have enough just enough

758
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:21,079
keepers so even people they will start

759
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,710
to drop out and to be there with time

760
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:27,109
you know people change their motives we

761
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,380
cannot control them then still others

762
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:29,089
will

763
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,000
just enough keepers to reconstruct the

764
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:36,769
secret also deportation system and stake

765
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,359
system can help but yeah that's that's

766
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:40,640
one of the crucial points we're working

767
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:44,450
on right now we just need to yeah we

768
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,420
need to in a lot of keepers ideally like

769
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:52,009
in blockchain like Bitcoin blockchain

770
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,759
40000 would be enough yes but thank you

771
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:55,849
for this question

772
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:56,480
okay thank you Pavel for a talk amazing

773
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:58,369
give him

774
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,019
thank your eyes parallel for others

775
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:02,019
thank you okay thank you

776
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:10,900
you
