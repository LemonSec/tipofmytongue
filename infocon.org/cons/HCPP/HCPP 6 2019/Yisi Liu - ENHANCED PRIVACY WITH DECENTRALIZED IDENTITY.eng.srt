27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,590
we go so firstly what is privacy so

28
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,740
everybody is talking about privacy in

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,229
the blogging world and II like the the

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,440
web 2.0 world everybody's talking about

31
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,200
privacy but what is privacy so by

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,360
definition it is a fundamental right

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,429
that is essential to autonomy and the

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,590
protection of human dignity

35
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:03,149
well that's to wait that's too dry I

36
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,819
don't want to explain it I don't even

37
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:09,899
understand this sentence at all

38
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:14,090
but specifically that um no one will

39
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:16,830
ever ask that why do you have a

40
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,640
understanding that links kernel book on

41
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,520
your shelf at home right because they

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,420
should never know that that fact and why

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,550
would they know that but like not a

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,399
friends will know that but maybe like

45
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,599
Google or Facebook will know that and in

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,349
this entire world it is crazy right now

47
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,649

64
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:37,668
data breach and another like scandal

65

like a failure of secure implementation

80
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,448
of their system so why would they like

81
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,729

82
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,940

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:25,330
that over like 1 billion like WeChat and

97
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:28,880
I guess people in here know we had

98
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,010
somehow yeah they leaked like over 1

99
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,710
billion which had conversations on the

100
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:37,550
Internet and they are like open access

101
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:41,960
to everybody and and this is the like

102
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:46,310
the the details of the conversation in

103
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:49,520
the MongoDB it was like really um it was

104
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,460
actually it was flirting it was yeah

105
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,169
well it was flirting it's nothing like

106
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,450
sensitive is nothing about the

107
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,360
government it's nothing about the like

108
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:02,810
securities and stuff it was just daily

109
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,080
flirting between like a girl and the boy

110
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,400
but they have like all of these data

111
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,169
opens for open access online and

112
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,570
according to which had or Tencent

113
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:17,720
because like we chat is belong to

114
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:21,050
Tencent the tenant officer told us that

115
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,500
they will never ever ever store data on

116
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,880
their server but here we go they they

117
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,040
have this all of these like

118
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,190
conversations on the internet open

119
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:34,880
accessed and this is the the other like

120
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:38,590
metadata of the that like database and

121
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,800
you can see that's everywhere and it

122
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:46,669
like influenced over 1 billion users in

123
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,820
China and it's over sorry over 300

124
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:53,300
million messages were leaked we're

125
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,580
influenced by that and governments well

126
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,440
I'm not just blaming like WeChat or

127
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,659
something or giant Chinese government

128
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,640
because like I'm from China I don't

129
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,270
really want to blame my government for

130
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,530
it

131
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:08,359
but not just like Chinese government but

132
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,219
all of those like the other lay

133
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,070
governments in the world are doing the

134
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,220
same thing because such as like the

135
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:20,450
prism project from the US which was

136
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,090
leaked by Edward Snowden liking 2015 or

137
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,940
something so like governments are

138
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,799
reportedly on doing this all the time

139
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,290
they want to control people they want to

140
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,300
control what we're doing online we're

141
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:35,540
like talking about online they won't

142
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:39,380
tell like influencers to like to move

143
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:42,320
towards their like desire to go but we

144
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,100
don't want that happen why is this

145
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,450
important

146
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:51,620
right well the above like three things

147
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:54,050
were three events were just there and it

148
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:57,470
wasn't like that affecting your daily

149
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:00,770
life especially if you're in China they

150
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:03,950
were doing they were okay cuz like yeah

151
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:07,520
the leaking assassins are okay and then

152
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,700
because it's in the US but I'm gonna

153
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,380
show you something that's really

154
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,560
important that's you can find them

155
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:19,640

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:56,050
it's in our life and second this is in

169
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,750
case you guys don't really know this guy

170
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,969
sorry I have to pull this guy out yeah

171
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,370
all the time I do presentations just

172
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,490
like Mark Zuckerberg so this is the CEO

173
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:10,130
of Baidu which is like Chinese Google

174
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,160
where Chinese search engine and he said

175
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,170
in 2018 this is a really famous quote of

176
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,929
a man he said on

177
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,569
Chinese consumers favor efficiency at

178
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:22,369
the expense of privacy rubbing Li well

179
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:25,549
and in some of the artificial

180
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:28,850
intelligence conference so he he said

181
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:32,989
this because Baidu is abusing all of our

182
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:35,509
like privacies and personal data like if

183
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,939
you search on Baidu I'm not sure because

184
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:40,249
I saw some advertisement when you are

185
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:43,368
like searching on Google but um Baidu

186
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:46,910
it's really really like a bad situation

187
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:49,100
here so if you search some like if is

188
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,809
for example you if you're searching that

189
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:55,970
um hey I'm I am not feeling well today

190
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:58,399
you are seeking for help it'll like

191
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,459
return you like tons of likes of to

192
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,660
Huysmans paid advertisement which come

193
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:08,179
from like like different sources were

194
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:11,118
like like personal even personal clinics

195
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:14,689
that was like killing people and this

196
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:17,389
has been like done by Baidu a few times

197
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:20,059
like at least like two people were

198
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:23,059
killed by that of Times manang by do

199
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:26,029
while they were searching for some like

200
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:29,209
diseases where were things and this is

201
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:32,540
really critical and the next one is even

202
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:34,969
like worse well it's not even worse but

203
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,189
even more spreading so maybe you guys do

204
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,970
not like really recognize like Chinese

205
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:44,959
for sure but um this is like Dede its

206
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:48,829
Chinese version of uber and this is like

207
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:51,410
a like screenshot from like two

208
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:53,689
different devices so the last one was

209
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,639
from iOS and the other was from Android

210
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:58,339
from two different accounts and two

211
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:02,059
different devices and they were like on

212
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:05,749
currying like a a root or an estimation

213
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:09,350
of price from the single like the same

214
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:11,629
like sewers and destination and they

215
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:15,379
returned like different prices for that

216
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:18,649
and their CTO told us that it wasn't

217
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:21,199
like deliberate deliberately doing this

218
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,829
it's based on algorithms but what

219
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:24,258
algorithms

220
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:27,349
they're like crewing the same pretty

221
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,070
much the same like exactly the same 100%

222
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,830
same

223
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,650
root but God like different like prices

224
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:36,350
well this is deliberate like price

225
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:41,569
discrimination in DD and the other one

226
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:43,640
is sea trip it's an online it's like a

227
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,650
Chinese version of Expedia if you in

228
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,870
case you guys don't really NIH's

229
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,030
that they will return like different

230
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,210
prices from the same room being the same

231
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:57,230
hotel this is really like something

232
00:11:53,210 --> 00:12:00,740
because like they were reportedly to use

233
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:03,320
like big data to help us to at least

234
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,870
they say that they said that our

235
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,410
algorithms are based on big data to help

236
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:13,250
you get more efficiencies but right now

237
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:16,280
we are being attacked where we are like

238
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:20,840
against by our own data power on big

239
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,860
data generated for them ok so why is

240
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,820
this important

241
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:28,330
so we are on in conclusion we are under

242
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:32,420
surveillance without being notified

243
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:34,850
obviously we we are actually I think my

244
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,310
talk where everybody's talk here is

245
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,700
being monitored by some government or

246
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:45,500
some some people some people thinks it's

247
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:47,960
it's worth to listen to and our data is

248
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,890
collected and shared across platforms

249
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:54,890
it's not just like on the same like on

250
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:57,890
one platform they were shared this data

251
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:01,280
for more like for more goods were more

252
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:05,270
benefit by sharing that data across

253
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:08,780
platforms and the data which was

254
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:11,240
generated by us is is used where is

255
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:14,600
abused by them to fight against us is

256
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:18,230
it's not like helping us to achieve a

257
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:22,520
better life it's it's fighting against

258
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:25,250
us this is really like disgusting to

259
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,530
think about it because they have been

260
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,300
claiming that big data is for us is for

261
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:34,730
the people but obviously it's not and

262
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:38,060
finally our privacy is by all is being

263
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:40,400
violated without being without letting

264
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,768
us know we don't even know that because

265
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,379
like our privacy

266
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:49,929
being valid at any time every single

267
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:52,809
second and what has been done well this

268
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:55,988
is I don't really want to talk like so

269
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:58,779
much on like a privacy and identity but

270
00:13:55,989 --> 00:14:02,079
this is really worth mentioning that on

271
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:04,239
to regulations have been done in the

272
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,910
past few years so sorry for the

273
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:09,819
formatting I just realized that just

274
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:13,209
minutes ago so the first one is GDP are

275
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:15,910
like it's really good I think that's the

276
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:18,638
best regulation in the world right now

277
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:23,499
for protecting people's data because of

278
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:25,839
its right to abelev area so people can

279
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:28,360
just ask Google or Facebook to delete

280
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,369
their like data from their servers and

281
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,769
from their data points from their

282
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,949
algorithms from their models this is

283
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:39,819
really good I don't think like big data

284
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:43,209
is good but we always have the right for

285
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:45,488
it to up to forget about us and the

286
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:50,018
other one is the the one in California

287
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:53,350
in which that you can ask everybody or

288
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:56,529
ask the companies in California that

289
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:59,259
where was my data and how did you use my

290
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,929
data these two regulations are really

291
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:04,619
good right now in the world and we are

292
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:08,170
expecting more to help protect our data

293
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:10,540
protect our privacy but these are

294
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,059
generated were like published by the

295
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,980
government we cannot control it we

296
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:17,259
really have to find a way to control

297
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,980
ourselves because that's the most direct

298
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:25,929
way to do this so my my second topic

299
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:29,220
here is okay sorry huh here's a list of

300
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:32,919
like a table of like the defines

301
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,779
generated by GDP are and in case you

302
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:38,529
guys don't really know that like Google

303
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:42,339
has been fined for 50 million euros and

304
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:46,720
British Airways was fine 183 million

305
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:51,549
pounds and so does Muriel's and Morikami

306
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:54,309
to be fined to really protect our like

307
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:55,510
data but this is really so I don't think

308
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:59,579
that works out

309
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:02,410
eventually and my second topic here is

310
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:04,560
after like say talking about privacy for

311
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,149
a little bit let me check the time okay

312
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,739
we really have to talk about like a

313
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,620
prattle like what is the identity

314
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,079
because without identity we don't really

315
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,060
have the privacy but what is like

316
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,920
identity here again so this is a

317
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,768
definition I don't really want to read

318
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,250
it at all this is so like dry again I

319
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:27,339
don't even know what it means but let's

320
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,779
take some example here so if we are

321
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:32,320
putting like penguins

322
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:36,459
we pretty much look the same here how do

323
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,279
we like recognize who is who like saying

324
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:40,869
like because like I just had a really

325
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,810
good conversation with mark

326
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:46,750
there's a this in the new we were saying

327
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:49,660
hey I just got something like we really

328
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:52,540
have some bad time recognizing like

329
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:56,260
people's faces but how do we like

330
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:58,779
recognizing people well I will mention

331
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,149
like the social identity and digital

332
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,430
identity so what is social identity it's

333
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:06,069
your social appearance it's your

334
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:08,129
occupation is your like faces for

335
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:11,309
example and your your your age

336
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,780
everything but these things are

337
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:17,168
recognized and verified by the

338
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:20,709
government it's something it's garma

339
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:24,069
stuff but the second okay the second I

340
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:26,620
would imagine is this so this is just

341
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:30,730
some random comic till like converting

342
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:32,979
like a man to a digital format sorry I

343
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,190
wasn't that obvious but what is your

344
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,440
social what is your digital identity for

345
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,230
now we can think about all we can think

346
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,020
about is your Google account your

347
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:47,320
Facebook account its what do you look

348
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:50,590
like on the Internet and then they are

349
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,178
verified were like like authorized by

350
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:56,770
the third parties by those are like

351
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:59,230
called large companies and on but what's

352
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:05,129
wrong with current there's no identities

353
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:09,500
well there is a lot to talk about and

354
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:11,900
the identity here or in general

355
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,540
it's a key enabler to your privacy

356
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:18,830
because without identity what is privacy

357
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:21,530
and the users of densities user

358
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:24,199
densities trust is largely dependent on

359
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,870
those like third parties on those like

360
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,390
giant companies because your trust your

361
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:33,320
trust on Google is dependent on Google

362
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,400
if they like if they are do not have

363
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,350
trust anymore

364
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,720
your can't doesn't have that either and

365
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:44,300
users need to register like multiple

366
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,190
cons across platforms on the Internet

367
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,830
you have to register your Google account

368
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,930
your Facebook account like you have to

369
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,810
register millions of different kinds on

370
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:56,750
millions of different platforms and

371
00:18:52,810 --> 00:19:00,350
these platforms control your data

372
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:03,380
themselves and they are they are

373
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:05,300
apparently abusing them right now but

374
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:12,530
they are supposed to protect that for

375
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:16,100
you right so I will refer these look

376
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:18,350
kind of like the current digital intent

377
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,560
ease as they one-to-one mapping

378
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:25,429
well I guess you know you guys know what

379
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,909
mapping is so it's a one account to one

380
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:30,920
platform and one needs to remember all

381
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,820
his passwords to all of those like

382
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,590
different platforms up obviously and

383
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,110
platforms control and store all the

384
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:42,379
personal like users personal information

385
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:44,959
such as your you are your your contacts

386
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,880
your your personal data and they write

387
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,150
it down on their website and your

388
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,440
passwords but what happened in the past

389
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,450
few years sorry

390
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,680
we have to like talk about these giant

391
00:19:53,450 --> 00:20:00,440
companies again again but they have been

392
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:03,440
really abusing our password this is so

393
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,620
stupid to store the passwords in plain

394
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,500
tags and it's not just Facebook it's

395
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:13,070
also like Twitter Google even Google

396
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,010
g-suit were found like storing like

397
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,710
passwords in plain tags in their product

398
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:22,129
and this is on github Twitter and the

399
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,400
Robin Hood you guys well yeah I think

400
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,400
you guys know all of

401
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:31,200
but they are like really having a really

402
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,000
bad like security level on this day why

403
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,430
would they do this because they don't

404
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,400
they don't really care they don't really

405
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:42,380
care your privacy or data they just care

406
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:46,350
how you guys can make money for them and

407
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:50,940
the second well for like solving this

408
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:54,600
problem some toes emerged such as um

409
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:58,110
like one password and LastPass these are

410
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:01,290
just password measurement tools at all

411
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:04,010
like you you as the user will only need

412
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:07,020
to like mmm remember one master password

413
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:09,379
instead of like remembering all of those

414
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:13,139
like different passwords at all and

415
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,970
it'll like store that for you but still

416
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,300
like it doesn't solve the problem you

417
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,940
still need to register like multiple

418
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,889
accounts for multiple platforms and your

419
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,820
data is still there and your information

420
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:30,480
still there is just a management tool so

421
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,010
I will refer to okay so this is like how

422
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,440
it looks like in the password

423
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:37,170
measurement tool this is one password

424
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,990
you just all of those linked information

425
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,120
are stored there so what is the

426
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:45,780
difference between like storing one

427
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:48,570
password instead of storing all of those

428
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:52,170
different platforms right so the second

429
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:55,830
on like type of like digital identities

430
00:21:52,170 --> 00:22:00,000
is I want to talk about is one too many

431
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:04,199
mapping which was done by Obon ID which

432
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,200
was founded in 2005 I guess and you can

433
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,600
find your facebook login or Twitter

434
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,840
logging what Google logging are offering

435
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,840
the Obon ID protocol and this is a

436
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,110
really good strategy because now you

437
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,050
just need one single like a conte on the

438
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,879
internet and you can authorize the other

439
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:27,240
platforms that there are the services

440
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,520
but data can't but does it really like

441
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,450
solve the problem yeah it's kind of

442
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,480
because like you will just need one

443
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:39,090
single identity on the Internet

444
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,559
then it'll like authorize the others

445
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:46,559
audiences for you but the fingers the

446
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:49,559
trust of your like identity is still

447
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,230
dependent on their platforms on your

448
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,690
identity providers such as like Google

449
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,600
and Facebook and still likes third

450
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,030
parties if you don't trust them you

451
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,590
won't lose your joy you will lose your

452
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:07,830
trust where like like reputation on the

453
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,020
Internet and still like it doesn't solve

454
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:14,010
the problem that data are still like

455
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:20,520
stored on individual platforms instead

456
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:25,440
of like somewhere like safe so this is

457
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:27,990
like Google login here or Google and

458
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,980
Facebook log in for some platforms and

459
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:34,200
the thing is single sign-on is is what

460
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,970
they call their do way and they're

461
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,919
pretty much the same to like one

462
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,049
password you just need to remember one

463
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,020
password to authorize all of them okay

464
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:45,629
I've already talked about that but what

465
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,870
is the last year well a lot of things

466
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,870
are still missing right because like

467
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:55,649
identities of steal centralized and

468
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:59,070
controlled by like third parties like

469
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:02,250
say your identity providers you still

470
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,200
cannot control your own identities but I

471
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,120
don't think that's that makes sense

472
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,970
right because like you are you and you

473
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:13,879
cannot control yourself this doesn't

474
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:16,980
work out at all and this is why I'm like

475
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:20,520
introducing you like the new one where

476
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:23,549
the thing I thought is working well and

477
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,059
war will be working is decentralized

478
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:30,030
identities I will refer that to a many

479
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:33,928
to many mapping so for example you can

480
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:36,809
have like one identity to authorize like

481
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:40,410
multiple platforms but that's already

482
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:45,809
being done by us like open ID and that's

483
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:47,970
just 10% the de property or the value of

484
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:52,049
design trans identities

485
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:55,080
the next the res like 90% was provided

486
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:58,769
by the second feature that you can like

487
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:02,220
actually create millions of like tons of

488
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:05,250
different identities or personas on the

489
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:08,279
same single platforms you don't have to

490
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:11,039
like now if you register for it like

491
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:13,470
Google or Twitter you can it'll require

492
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,879
you a lot of things such as your your

493
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:19,379
your cell phone number and which is

494
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:23,100
controlled by the government in many

495
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:25,740
countries such as like Japan each cell

496
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,080
phone number is like authorized by the

497
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,090
government and the China is reportedly

498
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,539
doing this pretty much the same thing

499
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:36,360
and it's bettering European America but

500
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:40,769
still it really centralized where

501
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:44,279
government control thing and you can now

502
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:46,710
like authorize yourself you can you can

503
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,830
pretend to be like anyone on any

504
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:52,769
platform freely without like any

505
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:55,799
restrictions were like permissions from

506
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:57,950
from different like platforms this is I

507
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:01,889
believe this is the power of

508
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:04,649
decentralized identity and one can

509
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:07,649
create intensities at any time without

510
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:10,018
any restrictions and you're like

511
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:12,600
personal information is controlled by

512
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:14,639
yourself you can control you can specify

513
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,759
which part of the information where

514
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:21,299
which part of my contacts is shared on

515
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,750
the Internet to which like platform but

516
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:27,389
the thing is the data is still like

517
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:30,059
stored on the like their platforms

518
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:32,428
you still like even though you have like

519
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:35,460
your decentralize identities you still

520
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:37,440
need to like generate data on their

521
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,809
platforms you're just still like

522
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,789
generating your there is you're still

523
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,799
like creating posts on Facebook and

524
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:49,769
still like they're right there it

525
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:53,158
doesn't like work out either and I will

526
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:56,669
like conclude the design shows identity

527
00:26:53,159 --> 00:27:00,690
as a cryptographic key pair all you need

528
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:01,470
to do is to create a Bitcoin like where

529
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:06,570
any

530
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:09,629
like Kripke pair a it can be like on the

531
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:12,418
elliptic curve or it doesn't matter you

532
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:15,090
can also create an RSA key pair or ideas

533
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,340
they keep her to do that it doesn't

534
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:22,199
matter as long as is a cryptography key

535
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:24,029
pair and creation only requires math it

536
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,159
doesn't require any like server

537
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:31,740
connections where we're we're like

538
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:35,549
increment enquiries I'm going to do is

539
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:38,220
to all slightly like create a keeper on

540
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:42,230
your computer were anywhere you can also

541
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:45,659
create a private key yourself and

542
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:48,059
calculate the public key with it on any

543
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:51,960
elliptic curve since it's just simple

544
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:55,860
math multiplications here and no one

545
00:27:51,960 --> 00:28:00,120
know you don't have to very get verified

546
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,219
by any like third parties and you can

547
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:07,590
control which information to be sure to

548
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:09,899
which platform and this is what w3c s

549
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,720
are proposing right now is called

550
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:15,239
decentralized identifiers is just a

551
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,759
document listening you're your own

552
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,480
identity on the on the on the top and

553
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:24,259
then you can specify which services to

554
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:30,000
be authorized by you on the internet and

555
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:34,309
these are like stored like oh so okay

556
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,919
I'm not gonna just say what is the trust

557
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:41,970
so yeah you can publish a document

558
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,220
anywhere but how do you authorize where

559
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:49,379
how do you prove that this document is

560
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:52,289
as as trusted is cannot be altered by

561
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:54,178
the other people there we go we have the

562
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:57,240
blockchain we have a distributed letter

563
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:59,220
you can like pose any like updates or

564
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,100
creation well they're pretty much the

565
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:05,179
same thing creations and update

566
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:09,299
deletions on the blockchain so yours was

567
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:12,869
now is dependent on the blockchain me

568
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:15,490
myself is a believer of the Bitcoin

569
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:18,668
although I don't really buy back

570
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:22,450
I still believe that Bitcoin has the

571
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:25,840
most like a trust over all of those like

572
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,940
different block chains and the trust is

573
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,699
beautiful these globally distributed

574
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:34,230
letters I'm going to do is just post

575
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,760
your like authorization also has changed

576
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:40,510
authorizations or updates on those

577
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:43,960
letters and I will say this is a choice

578
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:47,049
of mathematics cuz yeah is mathematics

579
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,080
if you trust mathematics and you believe

580
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:53,549
okay it provides like safety to that it

581
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:57,668
is there the trust is right there and

582
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:59,830
but we're is a privacy then so I've been

583
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:05,679
talking about trust but still like no

584
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:08,168
privacy right the IDS apparently lemon a

585
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,370
dear that the need of like a third

586
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:14,650
parties and the data is still like

587
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:17,199
stored on those like different platforms

588
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:20,460
that's a still the problem has he a huge

589
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,590
problem even though you have like great

590
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:28,299
di D systems you still need to generate

591
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:30,370
data on like those platforms and on we

592
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:34,750
have like seeing some like solutions

593
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:37,629
such as salad which was the product were

594
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:40,510
a project led by an Tim berners-lee who

595
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:44,980
was like the inventor of the world wide

596
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:48,340
web and it's mango is to say hey

597
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:51,909
applications instead of storing like

598
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:54,760
those the users data on your servers it

599
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:55,570
has to be like stored on their personal

600
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,830
pods

601
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:02,320
personal like data storages and you guys

602
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:06,220
if you guys need the data you should

603
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,799
like make a request to the users but

604
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,840
this is gonna take a long time to go

605
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,600
I'm just propose I'm just mentioning

606
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:18,549
their here but it has a real a long way

607
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:21,549
to go now we have to can we really opt

608
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:24,970
out this is my third topic which is

609
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:27,520
based on what we have been done in the

610
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,240
past to solve bowls like privacy and

611
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:34,330
Trust problem

612
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:37,390
and we can but I believe a lot of people

613
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:40,260
here I can't do that the rule really opt

614
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:43,510
out the system but we probably cannot

615
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:46,750
let everybody really opt out the system

616
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:50,470
this that was still like um used like

617
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:55,150
Facebook where like Twitter or any other

618
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:58,270
like messenger apps right to enable

619
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:01,510
users to control and so our attempt was

620
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:04,510
not to let people leave their platforms

621
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:08,170
now leave their safe zones comfort zones

622
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:10,840
which is let them stay there and we

623
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:14,470
provide some tools to build upon those

624
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:17,370
like platforms such as our two products

625
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm just mentioning there here there are

626
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:22,330
fully open source on the free well

627
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,429
that's why I'm mashing here if it's a

628
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:27,399
commercial one that I don't I'm not even

629
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:33,190
well be here so one is called mass book

630
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:35,140
it's a like browser extension and to be

631
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:38,650
used on social networks and the other is

632
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:41,410
an a mobile app called Tessa queue which

633
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:45,040
will be like presenting later and

634
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:47,710
decides so firstly we will present mass

635
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:52,060
book so what is mass book it's as simple

636
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:54,430
as a browser extension it it'll enables

637
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:57,669
users on Facebook where other like

638
00:32:54,430 --> 00:33:01,210
social network to post to create

639
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:03,190
encrypted post on those like social

640
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:06,670
networks you don't have to leave the

641
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:10,810
platform long to do is to like installer

642
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:13,960
extension and like create your post

643
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:18,600
where behave regularly as you have done

644
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:22,150
in the past and let's see how it works

645
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:25,389
okay sorry that's next slice so one mass

646
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:30,010
book it's okay we have nothing to hide

647
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:32,650
but we have the right to to to hide from

648
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:35,290
those like giant companies to have hide

649
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:40,050
from the evils and this is how it works

650
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:41,649
so this is my my facebook account and I

651
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:46,210
posted my

652
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:49,720
public key here as between two to two

653
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:53,890
lakhs and you can actually like create

654
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:56,410
encrypted post here it's on so these are

655
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,300
like the Chinese version but we have

656
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,640
like both English and the Chinese

657
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:03,220
version and the same time I'm just

658
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:09,159
presenting that I'm too lazy to create

659
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:11,320
another one so it's a like header a to

660
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:15,370
like normal people it's like some random

661
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:18,399
bytes like 300 characters but with our

662
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:21,668
accession it'll like decrypt the real

663
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:24,130
message here it's a morning kosgeb I

664
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:27,940
made this for another like event sorry I

665
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:30,730
was too lazy and this is how you do it

666
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:36,010
it's still like on the love to use you

667
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:39,520
have to create a pose like field and you

668
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:42,700
can like say whatever you want the plain

669
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,000
text here and choose whoever you want to

670
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:48,279
share with for now it's on default to

671
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,668
sharing that with all of your Facebook

672
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,250
friends but you can choose as

673
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:57,700
specifially which well whom to share

674
00:34:54,250 --> 00:35:01,090
with and you just click the Create the

675
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:05,109
post and it'll automatically copy paste

676
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:07,750
the cypher text in the real one the real

677
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:11,710
text field and then are going to do is

678
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:13,690
to post it on your Facebook and yeah

679
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:17,080
this is how it works

680
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:18,340
I don't I'm not sure I should explain

681
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,000
that a little bit here guys

682
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,510
but it's on the plane it's just so

683
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,470
simple

684
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:28,300
your that the users was trying to create

685
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:32,319
a post on Facebook which is hello world

686
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:35,500
and it's encrypted by aes-256

687
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,830
or any other symmetric key and this is

688
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:41,950
the u.s. effort tags and here we will

689
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:46,090
need to create a like an ephemeral key

690
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:49,589
pair to to our church he'll like for

691
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:53,050
secrecy and it'll like post your

692
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,740
combined the ephemeral public key in

693
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,790
your like payload and

694
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:02,299
posted on Facebook and I'm going to do

695
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:06,050
is so we're doing like encrypting the

696
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:08,060
messages with an asymmetric key and we

697
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,600
need to share this metric key with your

698
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,790
friends

699
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,839
that's where we are using like

700
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:18,920
asymmetric encryptions and here we were

701
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:22,130
using ECD edge which stands for elliptic

702
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:25,100
curve diffie-hellman it sank I will not

703
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:29,330
just describe it in detail but all of

704
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:33,440
those like shared encrypted keepers or

705
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:36,310
publi encrypted secret are are stored on

706
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,560
a decentralized database which is gone

707
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:43,220
the dowsers also here mocking at all

708
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:46,430
we were probably using his fantastic 12

709
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:49,009
to do this so we don't have a server we

710
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:52,460
don't have anything all we have is a

711
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:58,869
extension and everything is synchronized

712
00:36:52,460 --> 00:37:01,460
on that database and the second one

713
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:05,650
presenting is called tensor queue

714
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:08,960
it's a mobile app it's as simple as a

715
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:11,090
keyboard input method you can like

716
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,270
encrypt your messages and decrypt them

717
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:18,080
in wherever you want it's just a

718
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:20,450
keyboard it's it's nothing it's we

719
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,670
believe it's a general access point to

720
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:26,359
all the text field you can encrypt your

721
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:29,990
messages everywhere like this so why

722
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:33,590
Tessa cube well anyway encryptions are

723
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:36,080
not everywhere we have like an to end

724
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:39,260
encryption zing whatsapp and in

725
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,690
telegrams secret chat and in second all

726
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:44,420
but not all of them we want to achieve

727
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:46,040
end to end encryption in all of those

728
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,160
like different instant messaging apps

729
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,020
especially like messengers because like

730
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,560
people are using Facebook messengers

731
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:58,790
everywhere well at least it's in the US

732
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:01,640
and people will not be willing to leave

733
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:05,300
messenger because if I had like a

734
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,480
thousand friends and like 99 percent of

735
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:11,390
them are still on Facebook why would I

736
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,060
and need to like migrate to another apps

737
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:16,670
such as second oh where I only have like

738
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,099
five friends you will still need to like

739
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:22,940
stay in the same like instant messaging

740
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:28,040
app such as like messenger or like

741
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:30,500
WeChat right we want to introduce

742
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:34,460
end-to-end encryption Zehra where with

743
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:37,940
our app so it's this is another like

744
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:41,000
show presenting so you still like the

745
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:44,119
pink plaintext here and pull out the the

746
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,160
keyboard and you choose whom to encrypt

747
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:54,230
to and click encrypt and then it's

748
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:56,270
encrypted right there so you can also by

749
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,849
receiving some like cipher texts you can

750
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:02,540
also pull out the keeper to decrypt it

751
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:07,670
and we are now still using sorry we're

752
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:10,430
now still using the dpgp because it has

753
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:14,030
been running for like over 20 years it's

754
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:16,368
quite popular in the world but there are

755
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:19,310
like so much like there's so many issues

756
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:22,579
with it because it's not like a but not

757
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:26,119
just about like safety it's also about

758
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:28,400
like the tedious payload there so we

759
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:32,930
don't want to do that anymore we want to

760
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,730
have like a more efficient one so I will

761
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:38,480
present it later I will I will

762
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:42,319
okay times no not that much time is left

763
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,480
so this is a comparison of like secure

764
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:49,310
messaging apps in case you guys are

765
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:52,940
interested it it's in the WWC QM

766
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:56,089
messaging apps calm so this is a really

767
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:59,270
like good comparisons of like different

768
00:39:56,089 --> 00:40:02,690
messaging apps you will see if it's ant

769
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:05,150
and encrypted or if they have like

770
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:07,609
connections with the government okay I

771
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,760
will also open source this slice so you

772
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:14,420
guys don't really have to so um yeah Wes

773
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:17,119
you like using open PGP but in our next

774
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:20,350
version we're forcing users to use like

775
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:24,990
ECC's because it's more efficient

776
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,990
you use the same level of security and

777
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:31,630
here we are adopting the decentralized

778
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:35,379
identities because you can like use your

779
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:38,800
own like Bitcoin because our default one

780
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:41,620
is that 256k 1 which is Bitcoin curve

781
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,050
you can directly bring your Bitcoin um

782
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,910
private key here but I don't recommend

783
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,590
you to do that because it's too

784
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,720
dangerous if you have a 1 million

785
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:53,350
dollars you don't really want to use it

786
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:57,520
to encrypt your like like funky messages

787
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:59,529
but yeah and one social account is apart

788
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,670
from their keys you can control them you

789
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:06,880
can control your personas you just you

790
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:09,250
don't have to manage your like is like

791
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,070
the keys and that your social accounts

792
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:14,410
are not tight it together you can

793
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:19,980
control them you can control connections

794
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:22,720
and everything and also the data is

795
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:25,840
encrypted since the data is encrypted is

796
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,799
no longer on like point X on the

797
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:33,400
Facebook all the other platforms in this

798
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:36,610
way we achieve a middle layer of data

799
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:40,360
ownership and why did we choose this

800
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:42,250
path it's let me just do it quickly why

801
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,100
do we choose this because people are not

802
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:47,650
willing to leave obviously and we

803
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,720
provide users an opt-out option to

804
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,440
protect their privacy without forcing

805
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,629
them to leave their comfort zone and

806
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:59,170
we'll provide easy users and easy access

807
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:02,890
into Krypton are key they can it's as

808
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:06,450
like it's as easy as if you are using

809
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:09,310
like blocked rings and we converted

810
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:12,460
existing Internet giant companies or

811
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:15,220
platforms into an infrastructure that's

812
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:19,330
our key point here and as we have done

813
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:22,240
with like HTTPS SSL was those ISP

814
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:24,130
companies so they used to own our data

815
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,009
because they can see everything going on

816
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:29,530
going through their like bands but with

817
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:32,170
SSL errors every packet is encrypted

818
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:33,130
they can no longer see them and it

819
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:35,770
becomes a

820
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,850
infrastructure down and we are doing the

821
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,710
same thing right now

822
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:42,040
we're converting those like Facebook or

823
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:46,470
Twitter as an infrastructure as a CDN as

824
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:49,450
a AAA they are storage platform and

825
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:52,029
awesome you guys were just taking

826
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:54,939
advantages of themselves we don't have

827
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:56,880
to break them we don't have to like

828
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:01,270
create a new platform we're just

829
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:04,360
piggybacking on their platforms and this

830
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:06,160
is how it looks like if you have like

831
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,520
different like millions of different

832
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,440
personas yourself you can do it I

833
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,710
believe everybody has their like

834
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,940
different like appearances in the world

835
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:23,260
in the work at home and everywhere else

836
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:25,960
so you can actually be like that on the

837
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:29,170
internet freely without any restrictions

838
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,690
and that's all my presentation today and

839
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:33,640
you can you guys can check out on these

840
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,890
two and yeah

841
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,339
thanks so much for for listening yeah

842
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,339
thanks

843
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:45,220
with about seven minutes for questions

844
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:56,920
already one in the back already

845
00:43:45,220 --> 00:44:00,069
I didn't get if mass book work like TCP

846
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:03,670
where when the message is encrypted you

847
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:08,440
see just something that is not legit

848
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:11,410
legible readable sorry or if it's

849
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,220
something like random text that doesn't

850
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:14,890
make sense

851
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:17,859
or maybe no it's like PGP it's still

852
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:21,400
like encrypted and you're gonna sure do

853
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:23,259
you think is possible like choosing one

854
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,499
pattern and like I want to post

855
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:29,079
everything as if I am I don't know I

856
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:30,819
have a flower shop so I think that the

857
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:34,109
government thinks that I am selling

858
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:38,099
flowers or something like that right

859
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:42,578
well it's it's still possible right

860
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:45,460
because we believe that no one would

861
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:48,269
ever want to encrypt their like all of

862
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:51,549
their messages sound on the internet and

863
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:54,069
what they are really willing to do is to

864
00:44:51,549 --> 00:44:56,799
encrypt some like key things were

865
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:59,859
sensitive information and you can do

866
00:44:56,799 --> 00:45:01,569
like partial encryptions on that only a

867
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:04,180
like you can still like posting

868
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:07,538
advertisements your flower shop but

869
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:10,029
hiding the real address of that and only

870
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:12,059
encrypted that to some designated

871
00:45:10,029 --> 00:45:15,849
friends where designated customers and

872
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:18,730
yeah we're just providing a tool to help

873
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:24,089
you in crypt something on the internet

874
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:26,859
and it's up to you how to use it okay

875
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:30,239
thank you for the talk ah just a quick

876
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:31,390
question what's your business model

877
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:35,079
thanks

878
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:39,489
so I've been asking this question for

879
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:42,519
for for long and sorry we apparently we

880
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:45,519
still don't really have a matured

881
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:47,979
business model or we don't even have a

882
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:49,988
business model but we are just we're

883
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,470
willing to at least we are willing to

884
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:56,190
like share those liked well to err

885
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:58,379
- to all the users for now we are sorry

886
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:01,920
I didn't mention but we are a vc-backed

887
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:06,140
company and we are now still using like

888
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:10,380
visas money but we believe we can like

889
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:13,410
achieve some something really like

890
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:16,339
influential and useful to all the users

891
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:19,759
so I didn't answer your question but

892
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:23,160
sorry I I don't know either

893
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,800
hey we don't make money so far so you

894
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:28,200
mentioned that you know by encrypting

895
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,200
user data you will turn platforms like

896
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,419
Facebook into infrastructure and those

897
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,220
platforms many of them their business

898
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,290
plan is to basically take the data and

899
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,359
do anything with it yes so they have the

900
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:42,599
incentive to obviously to block all of

901
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,819
this stuff and imagine if we were making

902
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:49,230
Facebook right now and users were to

903
00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:51,720
freely encrypt the data what would be

904
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:53,760
some business models for companies to

905
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,618
you know that want to make a Facebook

906
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,119
but they don't you know they don't have

907
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,450
access to the data and what would they

908
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,770
do

909
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:06,078
well I will say that a our full cannot

910
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:08,700
be blocked because it's an extension and

911
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,980
to block it it's because like they're

912
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:14,609
like just encrypted messages encrypted

913
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:17,880
content if you really want to like block

914
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:20,970
it you will have to block users but why

915
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,579
would the face if Facebook is really

916
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:27,029
starting to block users is gonna be

917
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:31,109
disaster to them I believe and for

918
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:33,900
companies like in the future I haven't

919
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:38,098
thought about that yet I saw early that

920
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:40,920
if a company cannot directly take users

921
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:43,890
data how well they're like this is a

922
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,770
plan well be well this question is

923
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:50,520
really tough and I believe that on in

924
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:54,329
the future companies that can still like

925
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:56,369
query or request users data but they are

926
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:58,890
gonna pay something because like these

927
00:47:56,369 --> 00:48:01,050
data are generated by ourselves by by us

928
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:03,960
right and they're gonna pay us for

929
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:05,160
something and their need our permissions

930
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,710
to do that

931
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,960
and we believe they're still like to

932
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:12,869
pretty much the same like business plan

933
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:17,339
as before but it's gonna be like tougher

934
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:19,529
than before and I'm sorry but regarding

935
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:24,538
the business plans and stuff I don't

936
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:29,519
really like know that much sorry okay do

937
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:31,799
we have any thank you sure okay I would

938
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,439
be I'd be really quick okay thanks for

939
00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:36,960
your talk I just have a quick point it

940
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,119
seemed that reputation was was missing a

941
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,279
bit from being linked with identity say

942
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,210
legitimate business interest like maybe

943
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:47,400
with DD someone is a very rude passenger

944
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:50,220
they slam my door and beat my car up and

945
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,750
are rude to other guests so perhaps they

946
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,569
would like to charge a higher fee

947
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:57,569
because they have a bad reputation right

948
00:48:54,569 --> 00:49:02,640
um or you know some other case like that

949
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:04,589
and with with encrypting messages in the

950
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,509
way like privacy is a private or

951
00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:08,730
encryption is a private act right right

952
00:49:06,509 --> 00:49:10,890
if if my friend has all these encrypted

953
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:13,740
messages and some clear text messages on

954
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:16,078
there on their Facebook say then I know

955
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,729
that there's there's stuff that they

956
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,890
don't want me to know but I'm not

957
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:21,660
yeah I'm not in the group right right so

958
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,578
these these two things I just wanted to

959
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:26,038
ask if these are things that you've

960
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:28,440
considered either proxy data that looks

961
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:31,079
normal as was asked as well or

962
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,900
reputation for well I would choose the

963
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:37,140
letter I did a sorry to former because

964
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,809
we are now working on well we already

965
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:42,420
have does like think because like to

966
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:46,079
like to and then another step to convert

967
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:49,279
the ciphertext to some like normal

968
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:53,130
attacks or plain tax but this is not

969
00:49:49,279 --> 00:49:55,559
helping us advertise our product because

970
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:58,079
we're still like in the early stage to

971
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:00,720
like to tell people where hey where mass

972
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,509
work and then come use it but once we

973
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:06,180
have like many users where adequate

974
00:50:03,509 --> 00:50:10,440
users will convert it to the fully

975
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:13,379
encrypted way to to pretend it to be in

976
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,930
normal text but it isn't is it hidden

977
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:18,359
yes so we have one minute and two

978
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,109
questions I'm not sure we got to get to

979
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:21,808
you about what

980
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:26,339
right we can go fast sure thanks great

981
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:28,799
talk mass book decrypts the message and

982
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:31,589
substitutes the HTML correct right

983
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:32,190
can't Facebook submit the decrypted

984
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:33,839
message

985
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,819
well JavaScript back to its server oh

986
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:39,749
yeah I didn't mention this but we are

987
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:42,538
using shadow root it's a it's a part

00:50:57,269 --> 00:51:01,140
very interesting talk and I would like

995
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,910
to quickly confirm so you're a Chinese

996
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,828
citizen and you're currently a resident

997
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:07,109
of Shanghai yes

998

did I understand you correctly okay so

999
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:12,420
how does how do you find yourself

1000
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:15,450
positioned in that you're researching

1001
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:18,809
these privacy protecting technologies

1002
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:20,549
and services but you are under a very

1003
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:22,739
oppressive government when it comes to

1004
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:25,019
user privacy because the WeChat we know

1005
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:27,779
all the messages are monitored and

1006
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:30,359
actually they're censored and how do you

1007
00:51:27,779 --> 00:51:34,680

1008
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:35,220

1009

answer

1010
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:42,480
well we are I believe we're a dangerous

1011
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:45,720
position but we're we're here to help

1012
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,289
people and we consider ourselves a

1013
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:53,220
global citizens so yeah

1014
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:56,130
just please go ahead okay do you know

1015
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:59,730
that Facebook has react on UMass book

1016
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:03,660
and the messenger blocked any any

1017
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:06,480
messages with math book calm in the

1018
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:09,538
messages right okay so quick question um

1019
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:13,739
data we have filed a a like trademark

1020
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:17,700
and a has been reported by Facebook this

1021
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:20,130
but they will not gonna win this because

1022
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:24,739
like they don't really own the trademark

1023
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:28,049
of book and we're mass book and they're

1024
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:30,509
due to their like anti-spam divert

1025
00:52:28,049 --> 00:52:31,990
iseman regulations they have already

1026
00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:34,050
spent

1027
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:37,200
our mass Bochum and mass about the aisle

1028
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:39,970
but I don't think that they're direct

1029
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,598
direct reaction to our product it's just

1030
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:47,709
some like anti spammy like mechanism

1031
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:50,830
there but we are like migraine does to

1032
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:53,290
like the pure tax mass book and it's

1033
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:56,650
working perfectly and if they're really

1034
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:59,500
gonna ban a single word in liking on

1035
00:52:56,650 --> 00:53:02,530
Facebook it's again it's gonna be a

1036
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:07,330
disaster to them we're gonna sue them
