2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:29,880
I would like to welcome you to the next

3
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,050
talk and especially welcome professor

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,690
Robin Henson who is a professor at

5
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,410
George Mason University and he's an

6
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:44,220
author of two interesting books which

7
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:47,220
are sorry of more books but two or two

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,440
of which are here and they're both very

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,570
interesting and very different the

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,580
elephant in the brain is about hidden

11
00:00:51,570 --> 00:01:02,130
motives in a in our brains in our minds

12
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:06,329
and tells about the reasons that we

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:10,320
think we do some things is not the

14
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:13,559
reason we that that is really behind

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,589
behind our actions the age of M is very

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:22,130
interesting books a book and it talks

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:24,659
about an a future scenario where

18
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,609
emulations of human brains become

19
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:32,219
possible and how it will change society

20
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:33,809
if you like to read science fiction this

21
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:39,689
is similar but it's not science fiction

22
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:44,520
it's more like an interesting text book

23
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,678
like or scientific examination of this

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,819
scenario but many of you will probably

25
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:54,600
know Robin Henson because of his concept

26
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:58,950
of you Turkey which is a way to use

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,038
prediction markets to discover the best

28
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,380
possible policies and scenarios in

29
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:10,110
governance but also also in companies

30
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:13,560
and what I really like about his ideas

31
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,110
is that as Paul Rosenberg said if we are

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,660
going to opt out to something we should

33
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,810
really think about what we are opting

34
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,180
out to and Robin Hanson has some very

35
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,660
unique and clever ideas that we should

36
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,850
really consider about how this news

37
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,440
society that we are going to opt out to

38
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:37,280
should look like and we should consider

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,500
these options which are not very

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,620
intuitive well many people would not

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,310
just make them up it's it really takes a

42
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:50,700
lot of effort to come up with such

43
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:53,280
unique ideas and what's interesting is

44
00:02:50,700 --> 00:03:02,760
that they might actually work so please

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:06,930
welcome professor Robin Hanson I didn't

46
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:10,079
get the memo on the dress code and I'm

47
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,240
not gonna talk about crypto I'm gonna

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,720
talk about an idea for how we could

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,870
radically change a part of society but I

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:23,370
don't know how to do it without my

51
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:26,330
opting out sorry so the story here is

52
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,710
that in the old Soviet Union or China

53
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:32,430
they had the government run the food

54
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,990
system and the government told you what

55
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,400
food you were gonna get every week and

56
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,980
they decided what food to make and how

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,600
to make it and that's a very inflexible

58
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,399
system that doesn't allow you

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,079
individually to adapt to your

60
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,750
preferences and it doesn't allow a lot

61
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,300
of innovation and that's what we've been

62
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,700
doing with the crime system for

63
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,130
centuries now it's been a very centrally

64
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,200
run government system where everybody

65
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,019
has to get the same system in the same

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,899
way and it doesn't allow much innovation

67
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,860
or adaptation and the idea is to do

68
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,840
something a little better or different

69
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:10,739
so law has been around for at least

70
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,200
10,000 years and the basic structure of

71
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,109
law through almost all that time almost

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,880
everywhere has been relatively simple

73
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:19,859
there's some sort of a judge and then

74
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,140
there's two sides a complainer and a

75
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,130
defendant and these two sides have been

76
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,800
treated equally

77
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,780
typically in history they each have to

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,050
go do whatever work they can to collect

79
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:35,010
evidence make their own arguments and

80
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,990
then if one side wins the complainer

81
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,438
wins usually the other side has to give

82
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,939
them cash and

83
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,819
that's been the system for a long time

84
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,649
it has some problems of you need some

85
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:48,629
money to be able to sue you might try to

86
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:51,389
make up evidence and as we'll talk about

87
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:57,119
people might specialize in trying to get

88
00:04:51,389 --> 00:05:00,119
away with things but in the last few

89
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:03,689
centuries we invented and have adopted a

90
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:05,669
new crime system this new crime system

91
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:07,169
instead of having laws that come from

92
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:09,508
tradition and general cultural

93
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,489
perception it comes more formally from

94
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,860
agency rulings and legislature rulings

95
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:18,179
it tends to be focused on intentional

96
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,839
harm it tends to have two sides being an

97
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:23,039
ordinary person and the government and

98
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,039
if there's a victim they're not really

99
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:29,068
involved in the process very much and

100
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,878
the government hires this prosecutor

101
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:34,079
they hire detectives they set up all

102
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:37,679
that side of it they use all of their

103
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,079
budget to push on one side and the other

104
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:43,018
side maybe gets a public defender who

105
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:46,229
mostly says you should settle and then

106
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:48,329
the government punishes by choosing and

107
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:53,969
paying for prison or other sorts of

108
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:55,199
punishments why is crime law different

109
00:05:53,969 --> 00:06:00,808
why did we make up this new system

110
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:03,959
what's the point well law is relatively

111
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:06,149
easy when it the thing that goes wrong

112
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,479
arises out of ordinary interaction so if

113
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:10,589
your neighbors tree falls on your yard

114
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,449
they didn't do it on purpose they

115
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:13,769
weren't planning it you know your

116
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,059
neighbor you can find them you can find

117
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:16,729
evidence about them they can't easily

118
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:18,959
run away you can get their assets

119
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:21,568
ordinary law works pretty well for that

120
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,239
case but if you think about a bandit say

121
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,339
who hides out between the towns waiting

122
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:28,378
to pounce on people there's somebody who

123
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,229
are specializing and trying to get away

124
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:33,300
with things they're choosing a lifestyle

125
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,039
where they hide themselves they hide

126
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,439
their assets they hide evidence about

127
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,599
them and that makes it harder for the

128
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,129
usual legal system to deal with the

129
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,459
bandits and other people who specialized

130
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,289
in crime so in the ancient world they

131
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,990
just turned up some knobs to deal with

132
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:52,498
that which dealt with it okay they

133
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,699
killed people sometimes or if you

134
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:55,979
couldn't pay a fine they would sell you

135
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,229
into slavery

136
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,599
they would hold an entire family clan

137
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:03,389
liable for any one of them what they did

138
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:06,150
and clans wanted to produce reputations

139
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:08,310
for being treated well and so they often

140
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:11,638
put resources and for the most part that

141
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,159
worked out that is they could discourage

142
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,199
some relatively large harms through

143
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,879
those mechanisms but in the last few

144
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,919
centuries we've been reluctant to adopt

145
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,919
those things we don't sell people into

146
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,810
slavery anymore and so instead we

147
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,758
adopted this police system which is

148
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,139
focused on these kind of specialists

149
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,680
people who are trying to get away with

150
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,389
things and so the government puts money

151
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,340
into trying to find them and the

152
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,349
government puts money and effort into

153
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,758
catching them and punishing them and if

154
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,409
you they don't have money we can use

155
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,389
other forms of punishment and that's

156
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:45,509
been a way to deal with crime to deal

157
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:46,889
with this aspect of people specializing

158
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:49,039
and getting away with things which the

159
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:52,080
old legal system didn't do so well for

160
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,449
now this crime law system has a number

161
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,508
of major problems that you're probably

162
00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:00,330
aware of the government is powerful and

163
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,909
it's corruptible so the police get a lot

164
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,250
more budget than the defense even public

165
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:07,860
defender there can be bad incentives

166
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,990
when the government gets money from

167
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,430
things like often in history they have

168
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,469
made things up so they could get more

169
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:18,029
revenue or prison labor there's a lot of

170
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:20,520
parties in the government who can just

171
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,440
excuse people from crimes not just the

172
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,698
police but the prosecutor all sorts of

173
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,159
people along the line could just say

174
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,460
nope you're off the hook because they

175
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:31,319
choose not to prosecutor pursue and as

176
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,319
you may know the police often create a

177
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,329
blue wall of silence where whatever

178
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,430
rules they're supposed to follow if they

179
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:40,468
don't follow them the other police don't

180
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,799
catch them on it they don't pursue them

181
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:45,120
and in particular say in many to police

182
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,800
departments the internal affairs

183
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,930
department whose job it is to catch and

184
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,550
find when police do things wrong they

185
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,719
report to the same Chief of Police who

186
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,649
would be embarrassed if that were to

187
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,690
become public and so we have police who

188
00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:00,899
don't necessarily have to follow the

189
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,120
rules and this ability to push for plea

190
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,980
bargains gives prosecutors enormous

191
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,140
threats they can take any one person to

192
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,190
say we're gonna throw the book at you

193
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,420
unless you give in and

194
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,130
I can take any of your friends and

195
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,469
demand that they give evidence about you

196
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,660
unless they'll push them and this

197
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,790
becomes a very powerful system force so

198
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,640
we know that we've tried to limit the

199
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,780
force but it's been awkward we hold the

200
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,780
higher standard of proof from the

201
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,760
government we avoid say using fines or

202
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,890
prison labor we have rules of what

203
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,569
police aren't allowed to do we have some

204
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,760
rights that we put in constitutions but

205
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:36,660
those rights aren't actually enforced

206
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,580
very well and this entire centralized

207
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,110
state-run system again it doesn't adapt

208
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,000
very well to individual circumstance and

209
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,570
it doesn't innovate very well it's just

210
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,880
a central bureaucracy so I'm gonna

211
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,560
describe an alternative proposal and I'm

212
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,750
gonna give the name vouching to it and

213
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,390
it's gonna be inspired by lots of

214
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,130
examples of vouching in the ancient

215
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,960
world often a stranger comes to town

216
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,730
we're not sure we trust the stranger

217
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,370
unless somebody in town says I vouch for

218
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,830
them if some if they do something wrong

219
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,680
I will stand in for them we do that

220
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:10,050
today in computer security so we do that

221
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,910
today with bonded contractors Det

222
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:17,490
co-signers happens in the mob made guy

223
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,500
vouchers for somebody we tend to require

224
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,300
liability insurance if you're on the on

225
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,950
the road and you have a car accident you

226
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,050
have to have this insurer ready to vouch

227
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,480
for you basically to pay on your behalf

228
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,449
for somebody else's harm if you caused

229
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,460
that in the car accident this is the key

230
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,840
idea I'm gonna build on I'm also gonna

231
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,730
on the side build on the idea of

232
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,610
bounties that we could enforce things by

233
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,400
putting up bounties and having private

234
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,200
parties in force by collecting evidence

235
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,670
and then collecting the bounty when they

236
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,500
convince the courts that something's

237
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:51,209
true so if I'm gonna make a big crazy

238
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,250
proposal I shouldn't propose to change

239
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,500
everything that should be a basic

240
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,790
principle of a proposing change so I'm

241
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,620
gonna draw a line around what I'm not

242
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,469
changing and then I'm gonna change

243
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,430
things inside that circle and I'm not

244
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,200
saying we shouldn't change things

245
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,089
outside the circle I'm just saying for

246
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,950
modularity purposes I'm gonna focus on

247
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,630
this change and then later on we can

248
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,300
change other things so what's inside the

249
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,939
circle what's outside outside the circle

250
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,859
is what is a crime are drugs a crime

251
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,089
prostitution a crime I'm going to leave

252
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,660
the government still making that

253
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:23,580
decision still leave the courts deciding

254
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,530
are you guilty there's a court you go to

255
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,060
the court you present evidence they

256
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,390
still make that decision the same way to

257
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,790
decide are you guilty or not and the

258
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,370
government again sets priorities like we

259
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,900
do now but more explicitly which kind of

260
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,820
crimes are we trying to discourage how

261
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,439
much and which kind of crimes are going

262
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,180
to make sure we catch and detect if they

263
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,530
happen

264
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,989
that's what's outside the circle we

265
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,810
leave that the same inside the circle

266
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:52,050
what I'm changing is how we punish

267
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,270
people how any one person gets punished

268
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,829
for any one thing what sort of

269
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,600
limitations there are an individual's

270
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,190
freedom what kind of evidence can you

271
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,920
get about people do people have curfews

272
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,700
etc what kind of privacy rights people

273
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,949
have who can check your emails etc and

274
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:11,130
how we decide to investigate any one

275
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:13,230
potential crime who decides what a

276
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,610
priority is how they go about it what

277
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,310
resources they put in those are all

278
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:20,130
gonna change

279
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:23,630
all right so my proposal has three main

280
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:26,430
parts the first and the key one is

281
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:31,439
everybody must get someone to vouch for

282
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:35,160
them to cover all of your legal

283
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:39,000
liability that is if somebody Sue's you

284
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:42,930
and wins they stand ready to pay they're

285
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,490
on the hook to pay and until you get a

286
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,770
new voucher they're still on the hook so

287
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,110
it's a long-term commitment until you

288
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,730
get somebody to switch and because this

289
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,980
voucher is standing ready to pay the

290
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,020
official punishment for all crime can be

291
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,900
a fine that is the voucher pays the fine

292
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,870
but that's not the end of the story you

293
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:03,060
and your voucher had a contract and that

294
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,490
contract specified what happens to you

295
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,369
and you're caught and found guilty so

296
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,950
that contract could specify prison it

297
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:13,410
could specify torture exile whatever it

298
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:16,890
is and we will enforce that contract you

299
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,209
chose with your voucher what would

300
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:22,800
happen to you if you were caught and

301
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:25,200
found guilty in addition you and your

302
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,839
voucher decide monitoring what sort of

303
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,260
evidence can they get about you do they

304
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,060
get to read your emails do they get to

305
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,340
limit your behavior where you can go

306
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,959
when that's part of the contract and

307
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,000
you can also pick coleye ability you and

308
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,770
a group of friends can say we will be

309
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,130
liable together if any one of us is

310
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,920
found guilty we will all be punished and

311
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,540
that would also convince the the voucher

312
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,829
that they should offer you a lower

313
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,870
premium because they're gonna charge you

314
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,460
for this they're on the hook to pay

315
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,290
money on your behalf so you're gonna

316
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,670
have to pay them a premium for them to

317
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,189
be your voucher and you're trying to

318
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,229
figure out with them how can we lower

319
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,300
premiums which is the same as how can

320
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:07,290
you convince them that you're not a high

321
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:09,599
risk that it won't happen so that's the

322
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,360
idea with a voucher and fines and the

323
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,940
last part is every crime when is are

324
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,440
found guilty a fine is paid and part of

325
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,800
that fine can go to pay a bounty hunter

326
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,160
and so now the way the crime is caught

327
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,469
is everybody who is reached the

328
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,839
qualifications is entitled to go looking

329
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,130
for crimes and if they find one and

330
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,450
collect evidence and can come to the

331
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,400
court and convince the court that that

332
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,430
crime actually happened by that person

333
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,990
then they get paid the bounty and so now

334
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,599
the blue wall of silence is broken

335
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,030
because if you're about to get a big

336
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,100
bounty that you've been working months

337
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,319
on you're not that inclined to give it

338
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:50,780
up because some other guy in blue says

339
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,520
please please you will want your bounty

340
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,319
and of course this means laws will

341
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,130
actually be enforced there could still

342
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,140
be discretion by judges in terms of how

343
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,160
whether someone's guilty or how strong

344
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,620
the punishment should be

345
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,850
but the police the prosecutors the other

346
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,350
parties they're not going to be

347
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,810
exercising discretion they're going to

348
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:16,110
be enforcing the law as written on

349
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:18,810
everybody whether you're rich or poor so

350
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,000
one of the advantages here we're gonna

351
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:23,400
cut corruption and bias we're going to

352
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,630
enforce all the law it's gonna be on

353
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,630
everybody equally

354
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,479
today we have a big problem that when

355
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,520
people go suing they look for deep

356
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,750
pockets what they if there's any big

357
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,160
company associated with something went

358
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,020
wrong they go sue them even if they were

359
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,520
only tangentially related because hey

360
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,430
you got to sue the deep pockets now

361
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,689
everybody has a deep pocket everybody

362
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,000
who's involved in anything potentially

363
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:48,300
has a deep pocket so the courts can come

364
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,500
after whoever's actually responsible

365
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,240
you'll be able to search in this big

366
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,710
space of possibilities to find ways that

367
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,630
actually are effective so many people

368
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,310
say and I believe them that prison isn't

369
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,530
actually very effective at deterring a

370
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,660
lot of people from crime

371
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,280
what is the vouchers and their clients

372
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,240
will search for finding ways well what

373
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,870
will discourage them

374
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,820
and in essence many of the things we now

375
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,710
decide with constitutional rights that

376
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,440
we all have to decide together when of

377
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:16,660
police allowed to look in a car or etc

378
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,460
now you will decide that with your

379
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,500
voucher you will decide what

380
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,000
constitutional rights you have if you

381
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,660
want more than other people you can pay

382
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,900
for them you're going to have thought of

383
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,310
problems here yes we can think of things

384
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,890
that could go wrong well let's go

385
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,719
through them obvious one people say well

386
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,010
if it's a fine then rich people can just

387
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,960
pay the fine and they get excused right

388
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,900
but as you know in many European

389
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:44,080
countries I don't know if here fines can

390
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,180
vary with income or wealth so sometimes

391
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,160
a speeding ticket is so many days income

392
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,170
worth of a fine

393
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,280
so the which rich don't get off

394
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,329
if the fines vary with wealth or income

395
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,880
we might worry that people would make

396
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,380
bad choices and choosing clients we

397
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,070
could regulate that as we regulate many

398
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,900
other choices

399
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,730
what if clients don't understand the

400
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,369
contract it's a big decision to make

401
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,610
perhaps early in life so maybe we make

402
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:10,629
them get tests regulate that make sure

403
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,099
people are clearly making a

404
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,480
knowledgeable choice do we think

405
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,599
vouchers will collude we can use any

406
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,920
trust law how do we know that everybody

407
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,629
has a voucher it's important that

408
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,250
everybody does I think it's feasible

409
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,810
like today pretty much all cars have a

410
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,400
license plate because it's visible we

411
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:27,159
could do things like that with say RFID

412
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,720
tags you might worry well won't hunters

413
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,030
make up evidence in order to win cases

414
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,830
well of course but that's been the

415
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,660
ancient legal system for 10,000 years

416
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,490
the courts have always had to be

417
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,130
skeptical that this person suing to get

418
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,570
money might be making stuff up so the

419
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,370
court should continue to be skeptical

420
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:46,929
when one side Susan asked for money that

421
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:49,149
they might be making stuff up of course

422
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,460
if we're only changing things inside the

423
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,710
circle we're at risk for things outside

424
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,810
the circle being wrong so if it's bad to

425
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,520
have drug laws but we do this system

426
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,139
will enforce the drug locks it will be

427
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,780
more effective at making people stop

428
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,390
using drugs when the loss

429
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,590
you can't use drugs this isn't changing

430
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,650
everything this is changing how we

431
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,659
enforce crime not how we choose crime

432
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:14,920
law I have lots of thoughts about that

433
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:16,090
but this is limited choice many people

434
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,470
are worried that if there's less

435
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,879
discretion it won't favor them because

436
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,260
most people seem to think then when say

437
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,940
a police officer pulls you over on the

438
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,560
road if they use discretion that will

439
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,240
favor you I don't know why most people

440
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,700
seem to think that can't really be

441
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,960
favouring everybody but this would have

442
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:34,260
less discretion there's the obvious case

443
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,670
of what happens to an ex-con who's poor

444
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,629
somebody who is jihad a record of

445
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,900
committing crimes

446
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,370
doesn't have a lot of money there

447
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,070
they're gonna be charged a high premium

448
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,989
if they're getting the same contract as

449
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,629
everybody else but the system now allows

450
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:51,160
us to vary the contract so of course if

451
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,570
we steal sorry for this person the rest

452
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,270
of us could all subsidize this we could

453
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,560
all use redistribution and subsidize

454
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,230
their premiums that's always a

455
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,730
possibility but now we know we were

456
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,740
doing it for a particular reason for a

457
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,350
reason we might choose who you want to

458
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,020
subsidize and who we thought was worthy

459
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:10,780
but if their subsidy isn't enough they

460
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,300
can now choose to change their lifestyle

461
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,220
to reassure us so it's like choosing

462
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,720
someone to go on parole can we can be

463
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,580
convinced they are safe to go on parole

464
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,800
well now the voucher is basically saying

465
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,449
what sort of arrangement do I feel safe

466
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,820
with so for example if you work on a

467
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,920
remote logging farm you only go into

468
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,510
town once a week and an escorted group

469
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,280
they can read your emails your premiums

470
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,140
are gonna be low you'll be able to

471
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,330
handle that are your freedoms restricted

472
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,090
yes but that was the whole point of say

473
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,460
parole or things trying to say if you

474
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,659
you look like a bad risk maybe we don't

475
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,360
want to treat you like everybody else

476
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:47,170
maybe we need to find a way to limit our

477
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,760
risk and of course there's the issue of

478
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,650
how exactly to set the fine versus

479
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,879
bounty you set the difference between

480
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,260
the fine and the bounty two different

481
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,510
you get problems in two directions and

482
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:59,310
so I'd rather keep those numbers close

483
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:01,660
to each other which is quite feasible so

484
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:04,179
I've just given you a crazy sounding

485
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:08,440
proposal you can't do it with blockchain

486
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:10,630
that I know of and it's not something a

487
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,520
small group of people can necessarily do

488
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,160
on big things it's about crime which is

489
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,800
something that large societies do I

490
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,580
claim that we created the crime law

491
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,530
system over and above the usual law

492
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,790
system because there was a specialist in

493
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,580
crime people who went out of the way

494
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,860
like a bandit to hide themselves their

495
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,240
assets and their evidence and so we

496
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,340
created the centralized system which

497
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,590
we've had for centuries where of

498
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,060
centralized government bureaucracy makes

499
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,340
all these decisions about what to

500
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,639
investigate how who to let off how to

501
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,709
punish etc and that's not very conducive

502
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,140
to innovation or adaptation individual

503
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,570
circumstances and so I've proposed an

504
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,580
alternative that still leaves the

505
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,100
government in charge of what's a crime

506
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,560
and whether anyone accusations correct

507
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,419
and how to set the priorities for any

508
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,950
one crime which is the fine how much

509
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,300
we're discouraging it the bounty how

510
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,890
much we make sure we find it and catch

511
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:08,800
it and within those priorities we're

512
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,930
changing and privatizing basically how

513
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:15,100
we discourage crime and how we detect it

514
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:18,280
bounty hunters find the crime vouchers

515
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,050
discourage the crime everybody must get

516
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,120
someone to vouch for them an ancient

517
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:25,300
tradition in many context somebody

518
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,590
vouches for you your voucher basically

519
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,560
the criteria for them is they have to

520
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,510
enough money to pay the fine they can't

521
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,830
pay the fine they can't be a voucher but

522
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,530
if they can pay the fine they're they're

523
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:38,860
qualified you make a contract with your

524
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:40,750
voucher that says if you're caught they

525
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,790
pay the fine but then other things

526
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,290
happen to you and even before you're

527
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,970
ever caught they may have access to

528
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,280
emails they may be able to give you an

529
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,590
ankle bracelet whatever it is that you

530
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,170
and they can agree on the rest of us can

531
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,290
say you guys have the incentive to

532
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:58,180
reduce these fines we can trust you to

533
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,920
make those choices because we're covered

534
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,320
if something goes wrong we're paid the

535
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,850
fine and we know that you don't want to

536
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,540
pay the fine so you're gonna try to find

537
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:09,250
a way to make that not happen and we're

538
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,230
then we can get rid of the blue wall of

539
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:15,310
silence we actually enforce whatever

540
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:17,080
laws we put on the books we actually can

541
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,610
adjust the parameters whoever we think

542
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,889
is a larger crime we can change the fine

543
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,149
whatever fine and the bounty these knobs

544
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,100
that define the bounty they can be

545
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:26,830
adjusted for individual circumstances

546
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,870
terms of time of day kind of victim etc

547
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,110
as we like that's all part of outside

548
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,870
this

549
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,030
circle I've drawn inside the circle is

550
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,939
how we respond to those choices how we

551
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,610
discourage crime maybe we can let you

552
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,160
choose with your voucher how to ensure

553
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:52,178
the rest of us that you will not commit

554
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:54,820
crime and that's my proposal thank you

555
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:59,200
very much there are questions back there

556
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:02,379
okay wow so many questions okay you were

557
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:07,660
paying attention well so I'm gonna front

558
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:09,910
runner okay so my first question is if

559
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:13,120
you can tie this to the concept of you

560
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:16,390
Turkey and maybe describe it my idea

561
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,729
would be can vouchers make decisions

562
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,880
based on prediction markets on what your

563
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,919
premium is for example but maybe I'd

564
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,410
rather go in the direction of choosing

565
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,330
the laws and crime and fine levels from

566
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,970
few turkey that is few Turkey as a way

567
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,830
to use betting markets to choose laws so

568
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,450
that we get an outcome so we decide what

569
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,790
we want is the outcome it might be GDP

570
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,530
plus leisure plus whatever it is we do

571
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,480
agree together on what we want society

572
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,700
to do what we result the result to be

573
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,010
and then we use betting markets we

574
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,380
basically ask speculators somebody makes

575
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,879
a proposal if we adopt the proposal well

576
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,740
on average we think we'll get more the

577
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,690
thing we want and if the Betty the

578
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,240
speculator say yep we'll get more of

579
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:57,309
that if we raise the fine on murder or

580
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,860
lower the bounty on murder or whatever

581
00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:02,649
it is then we just do that so this would

582
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,979
be a flexible way to choose all these

583
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:08,080
crime laws with the eye toward producing

584
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,570
some outcome and so then we're not based

585
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,129
on ordinary voters misconceptions of how

586
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:16,418
the world works if if in fact raising

587
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,870
the punishment of murder doesn't

588
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:22,150
actually help then we wouldn't do it

589
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,590
making drug laws drugs illegal if that

590
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,030
doesn't actually help to get the

591
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,290
outcomes we want from society then we

592
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,720
wouldn't do it we wouldn't be based on

593
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,280
ordinary voters believing that drug laws

594
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,400
would help it would be based on what

595
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,059
speculators think who know a lot more

596
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,990
okay thank you

597
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:39,639
Robin a quick question for you this is

598
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,970
based on what I understand after

599
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,539
proposal sumption here is your kind of

600
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,489
assuming

601
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:46,779
as an information symmetry generally

602
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:48,639
speaking in governor's there's an

603
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:50,440
information asymmetry the people who

604
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:52,178
enforce have higher information say

605
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,129
think about the government they have

606
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:56,499
more information about everything than

607
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:58,059
an average citizen so if you are

608
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:59,619
proposing such a proposal that you're

609
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:02,649
proposing currently do you think it's

610
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:04,720
going to work I'm not understanding so

611
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:06,100
information asymmetries are all across

612
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,239
live everywhere they're in the current

613
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,709
criminal law system they would be in a

614
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,299
new one so what asymmetry you think is

615
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,600
the petitioner Olly if you want to end

616
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:15,729
force in any sense it assumes that the

617
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,959
set of people who are you know say

618
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:20,019
saying that something has been broken

619
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,720
has access to the bigger picture whereas

620
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:25,059
on an average if you are a citizen or an

621
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,039
amorous normal person the resources that

622
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:30,190
you have at your disposal to do the

623
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,679
discovery is bounded so in the

624
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,419
traditional legal system if you want to

625
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:35,950
sue somebody it's your job to go collect

626
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:37,119
evidence and their job to collect

627
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,320
evidence and then you present the

628
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,359
evidence to the court and the court

629
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,769
makes the decision obviously initially

630
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,259
people don't know things they go collect

631
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:46,149
evidence and the information asymmetries

632
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:47,409
reduced via the process of collecting

633
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:49,209
evidence and presenting it to the court

634
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:51,220
that that's how the legal system has

635
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,229
worked for 10,000 years and it's works

636
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,389
for everything else other than criminal

637
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:57,639
law just fine and it even works okay in

638
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:59,049
criminal law so we have the standard

639
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,809
system for dealing with information

640
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:04,210
asymmetry ie detectives go detect

641
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:06,908
evidence and information they collect it

642
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:10,649
they present it to a court okay

643
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:10,649
I've probably caught it wrong then sorry

644
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:30,300
have two questions the first one is when

645
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:33,450
somebody cannot find a person who watch

646
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:36,180
for them what happens you said about

647
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,580
this license plates but if I don't want

648
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:44,490
to have a license plate I just don't buy

649
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:48,540
a car and if I just can't find anybody

650
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:51,180
who watch for me what do i do do you yes

651
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:54,840
there will be three suggests there will

652
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:56,610
be a public option like with health

653
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,250
insurance which Shephard and Sanders

654
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:03,300
proposes so those were the two questions

655
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,980
right but what happens if I can't find a

656
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,060
person who watch for me and then you

657
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:11,640
also asked about the IDS ah no it's just

658
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,500
like a consideration so you know as you

659
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,600
may know today there are people in

660
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:20,130
prison and then we asked should they be

661
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,510
paroled and sometimes they say no but

662
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,730
that's a very bureaucratic centralized

663
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:28,940
decision process here it's a much more

664
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:32,460
flexible process in the sense that you

665
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:34,500
have to get the previous people who you

666
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,570
know had the decision to agree so the

667
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,340
two basic options for long term

668
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,929
commitments are one we have a public

669
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,209
option as you mentioned there can be a

670
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,280
waiting area concept a place where if

671
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,800
nobody will vouch for you you go there

672
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,930
and you know it's not very pleasant but

673
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,330
you hopefully for a while find a way to

674
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,100
get somebody vouch for you or we just

675
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,139
make it be long term contracts which I

676
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,389
find more attractive that is say at the

677
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,730
age of 18 you get a voucher and this

678
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,870
voucher is stuck with you until you can

679
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,210
get it unless you can get another one

680
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,159
you you can't they can't walk out

681
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,320
governmentís you are sure second

682
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,440
government issue to our chair no no not

683
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,790
government issue holy so at some

684
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,560
early stage in your life your parents

685
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:17,159
will get you a voucher and this voucher

686
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:21,659
is yours for I'm an orphan so again I am

687
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:24,510
an orphan that's a pretty small edge

688
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,560
case here yeah but steels are service or

689
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,470
an orphanage

690
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:31,110
wherever you are surviving then we'll

691
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,910
get you a voucher that that is having a

692
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,800
voucher as part of being an alive

693
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,000
citizen in this society you need food

694
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,080
you need a place to live you need a

695
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,779
voucher it's

696
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,668
I'm not speaking about like a majority

697
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:44,369
of society but obviously there will be

698
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:46,340
some like small minority probably very

699
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:48,629
small minority probably just like

700
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,928
thousands of people like in single

701
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:54,090
digits thousands who cannot find anybody

702
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:56,519
who watch them what happens to these

703
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:59,549
people as you said a public option is

704
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:03,869
one option okay ah I favor a different

705
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:06,179
option but that's a slight detail the

706
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:10,799
second question you said that rich

707
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:14,489
people pay higher fines today which I do

708
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:16,559
not find very good but still rich people

709
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:20,940
have to disclose like everyone has to

710
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:23,369
disclose their income to the state in

711
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,999
their income declaration like text

712
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:30,629
declaration and the state nurse who is

713
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:34,049
region who is poor and if state finds on

714
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:38,488
the basis of the income wealth it has

715
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:40,158
information provided by a person and if

716
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:44,669
the person doesn't provides information

717
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:50,100
his becomes criminal so in this system

718
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:53,009
how do you know how much money a person

719
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,600
have should he disclose it publicly or

720
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:56,340
how how it works

721
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,830
that choice is independent of my

722
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,869
proposal so the current system if it

723
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,220
punishes you it could make that

724
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:03,389
punishment contingent on things like

725
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,859
your wealth but then it will need to

726
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:07,109
find that out somehow and that's also

727
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:08,879
true of this alternative whatever the

728
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:10,259
fine is depended on they will have to

729
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:11,759
know that thing in order to set the fine

730
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:13,649
dependent on it that means they will

731
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,629
either have a regular records to it or

732
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:17,668
get records in this context to find out

733
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:19,320
that's just generically true of legal

734
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:20,549
systems they can only make rulings based

735
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,809
on things they know yeah but the

736
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:27,239
difference is that today I disclose my

737
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:32,119
income information to the agents of

738
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:36,919
State who obliged to keep it secret and

739
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:39,359
in this system well I'm not sure but it

740
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,669
logically follows maybe there are other

741
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,830
ways but it logically Falls that I

742
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:46,559
should disclose it publicly to everyone

743
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:49,199
to know how much money I earn I don't

744
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,820
see that so so today again there are

745
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,590
countries we are fine depend on you well

746
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,030
the courts when they implement those

747
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,470
fines they have to find out your wealth

748
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,020
presumably they look up the government

749
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:00,510
records this isn't any different again

750
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,030
if you're going to have a fine depending

751
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,290
on something information they'll have to

752
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,030
have that information or have a way to

753
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,860
get it that that's just true of the

754
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,450
system today of the system of any other

755
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,240
system we could possibly imagine so it's

756
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,560
it's not a reason to like or dislike the

757
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,050
system because that's just a common

758
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,960
feature of all legal systems thank you

759
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:21,389
but the court in your proposal is still

760
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,820
run by state yeah the same court so I'm

761
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:26,010
not outside the main circuit how how

762
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:29,010
courts are run what who sets those

763
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,640
decisions that's outside the circle so

764
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:34,830
basically have proposed a system where

765
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,300
most citizens will be subject to mega

766
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:39,149
corporations who are under watching

767
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,639
systems because surveillance has an

768
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:43,560
sevilla economy of scale which means

769
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,320
that it is very profitable and very

770
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:48,179
logical that surveillance of normal

771
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,639
population is centralized in large

772
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:53,730
corporations that basically can then

773
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,530
make their own rules and so basically in

774
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,290
a sense what you have proposed hearest

775
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,720
punishment of basic human rights to

776
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:04,770
large corporations that are essentially

777
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:08,550
immune to checks and balances I think

778
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:12,870
you are making the concern of number

779
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:14,280
four what if the vouchers were had such

780
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,100
enormous scale economies that there were

781
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,330
a small number of vouchers and they

782
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,540
therefore didn't compete very well and

783
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:23,850
they took over and ran everybody so

784
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:27,330
today private police and private

785
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,679
detectives and private insurance is a

786
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,659
pretty competitive industry it's not

787
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,880
taken over by a small number of huge

788
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,100
firms today in these industries they

789
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,660
have a lot of competition I don't see

790
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,459
any reason to expect that to change here

791
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,680
but if it did we could use antitrust law

792
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,150
just as we would for a unless we do it

793
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,710
today for Facebook and Google which

794
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,180
would be logical contenders to do

795
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:48,450
exactly that because they have to date

796
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:50,150
already I don't think being Facebook

797
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,890
helps you be a voucher I really don't

798
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:54,750
it's nothing else but an insurance

799
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,490
system that you're proposing there and

800
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,350
that is exactly what Facebook and Google

801
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,660
and whatever is getting into because

802
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:03,179
they have the data to calculate the

803
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,050
better premiums and the data gives them

804
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,940
a competitive

805
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,560
advantage divorce newcomers on the

806
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,680
market that is why they are currently

807
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:14,149
centralized I actually expect churches

808
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,150
to have a competitive advantage here

809
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,810
organization that you have strong ties

810
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,270
with where those people will actually

811
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,770
watch out for you and intervene in your

812
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:25,500
life if they see you going wrong

813
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:27,240
Facebook is Google or not those sorts of

814
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,120
deeply involved people in your life well

815
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,860
think of your employer or your family or

816
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,449
your church those would be the

817
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,250
organizations that would be best suited

818
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,920
to be a voucher because they need to

819
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:40,830
know not just know things about you they

820
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,780
need to be involved in your life that is

821
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,490
exactly what Facebook and Google are for

822
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:49,080
the most people on this planet right now

823
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:51,180
the so if they I'm sorry I'm sorry they

824
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,919
have the closest relationship to most

825
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,810
people right now I guarantee you right

826
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,340
you don't have to choose Facebook for

827
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,800
your voucher if you don't like Facebook

828
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,679
don't choose them if somebody else wants

829
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,419
to choose Facebook let them but you have

830
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,680
the entire world of organizations

831
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,200
available to you to choose as your

832
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,210
voucher anybody who has money to pay

833
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,389
your fine can be a voucher you pick

834
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,520
anyone who meets that criteria that's

835
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,929
the rule here you pick anyone who just

836
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,500
has the money they're willing to back

837
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:21,990
you up

838
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:24,659
they're your voucher okay so what about

839
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:28,199
celebrities like you have you mentioned

840
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,928
churches in America have these guys the

841
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:33,359
priests who run mega churches and they

842
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,370
have millions of followers they can

843
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,890
persuade people to vote for them and

844
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:40,560
they can be untouchable because they

845
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:44,120
have mission from Jesus and you know

846
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,040
millions of people vouch for their

847
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,480
sanctity or whatever and if you can

848
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,400
convince millions of people to hand you

849
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,830
money every week you've got a money pump

850
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,200
and you know that's a problem right

851
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:57,990
there this is only a side effect of that

852
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,600
so that you can use this big pile of

853
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,399
money to pay for vouching is just a

854
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,450
small thing compared to the larger

855
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,770
problem that you got all these people

856
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,700
handing any money maybe there would be

857
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:11,400
some guy who will persuade somebody to

858
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:15,180
like vouch for them and then they will

859
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,490
kills people life on the live TV and you

860
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,140
know he's untouchable because

861
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,540
if we don't like that we can raise the

862
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,790
fine for killing people on live TV we

863
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,970
can raise it as high as we like turn

864
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:29,099
that knob to the max you know that's

865
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:30,720
outside the scope of my Kozel deciding

866
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:32,760
that that's a bad thing and we want it

867
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,250
to stop it's just one more edge case

868
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,569
from the boundary of inner and outer

869
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:41,369
circle circle so if you have like for

870
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:47,700
example a bunch of hobos on the street

871
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:49,829
and who who checks for them who asked

872
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,020
them who vouches for you guy on the

873
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:54,150
street so it's worth remembering what

874
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,540
the existing legal criminal law system

875
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:59,190
is like remember so police have rules

876
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:03,619
they don't have to follow they can be

877
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:05,730
bribed you can be pressured into

878
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,280
admitting guilt when you aren't guilty

879
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,720
because you don't who can't afford to

880
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,430
sue the police who have a lot more

881
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,839
resources than you and they can take any

882
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,040
of your friends and make them testify

883
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,430
against you by threatening them in the

884
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,990
same way that's the world you have now

885
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:20,308
I'm not proposing this as perfect I'm

886
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:27,839
proposing it as better than what you

887
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:29,190
have now hello yeah thanks for an

888
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,790
interesting talk

889
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:34,740
my concern and I like to hear we had say

890
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,960
about this and this comes from 10 years

891
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,540
of working in the police is that there's

892
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,339
a possibility that the system if you

893
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,089
overcome the logistical issues might

894
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:44,609
actually work

895
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:46,680
too well and so what do you think about

896
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:48,930
the potential danger about the way this

897
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,569
might create a world where is every

898
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,490
incentive to enforce every possible law

899
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:54,690
and create laws for everything that you

900
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,808
can imagine because now this is this

901
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,069
amongest financial incentive on a medal

902
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:03,390
level about what they might do for

903
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:06,299
society so the whole world we live in is

904
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:09,058
a set of systems I'm changing one system

905
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:11,930
within that world if other systems are

906
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:14,369
bad enough that could be worse so I have

907
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:17,009
libertarian colleagues who think that in

908
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:19,020
general we should put bricks around the

909
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,670
legs of the police we should do anything

910
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,040
we can make them ride bicycles anything

911
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,569
we can to make the police less effective

912
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,880
would be good because they don't think

913
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:28,380
laws should be enforced so if you're

914
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,240
that sort of person then you don't want

915
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,140
a more effective criminal law system you

916
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,209
just want to throw

917
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,460
Oh sand in the gears of the machine and

918
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,430
I'm not throwing saying I'm putting oil

919
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,230
in the machine making it run smoothly

920
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:42,029
but hopefully we can fix the other

921
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,340
problem in addition to fixing this

922
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:46,650
problem and make better ways to choose

923
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,170
the laws and as was mentioned few turkey

924
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:52,380
is one of my best proposals for doing

925
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:55,080
that but yes if other systems are bad

926
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,610
enough you might not want this to works

927
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,710
right so for example if your military

928
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,180
commanders are too gung-ho to fight wars

929
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:05,040
you might not want them to have more

930
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:06,810
effective weapons right but some people

931
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,920
work on more effective weapons thinking

932
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:13,230
that their militaries aren't too bad

933
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:18,360
another yeah hi

934
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:21,770
so yeah loved your talk who vow is for

935
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:25,020
the vouchers so if you have a church

936
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:28,650
let's call it Scientology for example

937
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:31,170
and more example yeah for example and

938
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:34,590
let's say they actually vote for all

939
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:37,020
their followers but then it's found out

940
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:39,480
that they're actually conspiring so they

941
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,880
are like the church itself becomes

942
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,240
liable for some criminal offense so who

943
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,100
would vouch for the church so I've

944
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,049
chosen this word vouching because it has

945
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,490
a nice amount emotional punch but if you

946
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:53,460
notice technically it's an insurance

947
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:55,950
company and in insurance today we have

948
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,990
something called reinsurance most

949
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:00,060
insurance companies don't just go based

950
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:02,580
on their capital they go on having a

951
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,980
reinsurance contract to cover their risk

952
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,210
which is why you can trust an insurance

953
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,160
company that might not be around if

954
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:11,910
they're reinsured so here the vouchers

955
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,740
themselves should be vouched and there's

956
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:15,839
a technical question of how exactly you

957
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:19,350
set the maximum out they should be you

958
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,760
know ready to pay and it's not clear

959
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:22,319
there should be a maximum but if there

960
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,410
is there's a question there but the

961
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:30,420
basic idea is the vouchers are vouched

962
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:34,109
just as today insurers are insured hello

963
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:36,690
I'm here thank you you have put a great

964
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:39,390
proposal of privatizing a low in

965
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:44,470
enforcement to industry I like it very

966
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:47,470
much how do you see do have a row

967
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:52,750
Mireya an idea how to implement it

968
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:57,040
without involving state or state legal

969
00:39:52,750 --> 00:40:00,130
system because existing police or law

970
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:04,180
enforcement in general has zero

971
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:06,640
incentive of doing this thank you well

972
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,919
in general for innovation as with future

973
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,220
key I think the proper path is smaller

974
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,930
to larger scale trials so you don't go

975
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,399
immediately to getting a new

976
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:19,060
constitution that changes everything

977
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,590
you try smaller scale versions so we do

978
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,270
have a smaller scale version in terms of

979
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:24,220
how we do automobile insurance for

980
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:26,140
example we could continue to have other

981
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,419
smaller scale versions we could say have

982
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,680
bounty hunters who get parking fines we

983
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,660
could move in those directions there's a

984
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,359
lot of margins on which we could slowly

985
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:37,240
experiment more private organizations

986
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,940
can use this when they have internal

987
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,279
rules that they enforce even a church

988
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,050
for example if they say anybody in the

989
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,480
church who finds a violation gets paid a

990
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:48,099
bounty everybody in the church must have

991
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,230
somebody vouch for them in order to

992
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:51,760
cover they what they might do wrong in

993
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,160
the church then a church could do things

994
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,190
like this there's a very wide range of

995
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,569
possible trials in my work on few Turkey

996
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,160
I've found that it's relatively easy to

997
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,839
give abstract arguments that persuade

998
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,118
people it's very hard to get them to

999
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,980
actually move and do anything and my

1000
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:07,480
hope is that by talking about crime at

1001
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,710
something people more emotionally care

1002
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,990
about and they might actually do

1003
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:14,230
something because they have felt and

1004
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:17,470
feel the pain of being hurt by crime or

1005
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:19,240
being punished for crime on either side

1006
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:21,970
it's both paint both sides are very

1007
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:25,089
painful and maybe that emotional energy

1008
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:26,890
of just seeing how broken it is and it

1009
00:41:25,089 --> 00:41:29,290
could be better would induce people to

1010
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,180
do more small-scale trials but the

1011
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,589
possibilities are all over the map one

1012
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:35,410
person suggested which I do think makes

1013
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:36,910
sense as a replacement for parole but

1014
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,160
that requires more again government

1015
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:41,440
involvement into choosing but you could

1016
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,759
think of you first start this a person

1017
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,119
who wants parole needs to get Eve out

1018
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:53,740
your two to convince the prison to let

1019
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:55,330
them out of prison yeah yeah the person

1020
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,979
on the bag that was working for the

1021
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:58,029
police finest to another very similar

1022
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,130
question but I

1023
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:04,870
you didn't really answer so I will

1024
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:07,500
double down maybe I'll rephrase I think

1025
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:09,910
what you're proposing to me since

1026
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:13,420
somehow like an interesting proposition

1027
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:16,450
but based on the fact that we will we

1028
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:19,270
would all agree on what constitutes a

1029
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,379
law that we should respect or not and I

1030
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:23,050
think it's not really the case

1031
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,760
especially in democracies well you know

1032
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:27,280
every five years the laws might change

1033
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,460
and so on and I take it as a given that

1034
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,790
a large part of the population is not

1035
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,650
agreeing on what law is actually you

1036
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:39,970
know should be respected or not and when

1037
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:42,610
you privatized basically law enforcement

1038
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:45,250
and when everyone has an economic

1039
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:47,290
incentive to spy on each other I'm

1040
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,260
curious if you can comment or whether

1041
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:55,900
you explored in your thought experiments

1042
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:58,060
the impact on the basic social

1043
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,120
structures that we take for granted such

1044
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:04,120
as a friendship group of friends and so

1045
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:07,450
on so I will just make a very practical

1046
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:09,819
example if I you know go out and smoke a

1047
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:11,710
joint with some friends because we all

1048
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,870
agree that the law is written that we

1049
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:18,610
are not supposed to smoke but we all

1050
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:21,670
find that what would become of my group

1051
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:23,530
of friends if they all have an economic

1052
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,260
incentive to take a picture of me

1053
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:29,710
smoking a joint and then send that to a

1054
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:31,420
vote to a booty-booty hunter in a way

1055
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:34,180
that is anonymous I would never even

1056
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,610
know which friends is betraying me so

1057
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,710
yeah can you comment on you know what

1058
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,030
impact it would have on like so

1059
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:42,130
everything that we take for granted

1060
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:44,320
right now there's two issues here one is

1061
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,910
what happens when law is more strongly

1062
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,590
enforced and the other is what happens

1063
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:50,560
when the people around you might testify

1064
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:54,070
against you or give evidence about you

1065
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,170
so on the first part when something can

1066
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,060
be made more efficient you can use that

1067
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:01,780
more efficiency in two different ways

1068
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:04,299
so we could either keep the laws we have

1069
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:07,570
now enforced at a similar level and just

1070
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:11,450
greatly lower the cost we we suffer from

1071
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:13,400
enforcing the law or we could enforce

1072
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,410
suffer a similar level of cost and

1073
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,630
enforcing the law and then have laws

1074
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:19,819
more strongly enforced we we can choose

1075
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,799
anything along that spectrum as our

1076
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:23,480
option we don't have to change to a

1077
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:24,859
different world in terms of how often

1078
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,930
things get forced or caught

1079
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:29,509
we could hold that constant and just

1080
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,770
greatly reduce how long people spend in

1081
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,690
prison and how much we're spending on

1082
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:37,160
that etc that would be one of the

1083
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:40,220
options now today in law you are all

1084
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,808
typically have to stand ready to testify

1085
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,240
against any of the rest of you with a

1086
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:48,650
very limited number of exceptions so

1087
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,629
spouses or therapists have or priests

1088
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:53,869
have some exceptions but all pretty much

1089
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:55,730
all the rest of you are compelled to

1090
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:58,579
testify against any of the rest of you

1091
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,500
if the police demand it and the courts

1092
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:03,349
demand it so you're already in the

1093
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,609
situation where your friendships are

1094
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:06,319
threatened by the fact that you could

1095
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:08,890
each be forced to testify against the

1096
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,890
other now

1097
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:17,480
we could of course in your contract with

1098
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:18,828
your voucher you could specify that you

1099
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,380
don't have to testify against your

1100
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:23,390
spouse or whatever it is that is those

1101
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,710
are part of the parameters now with it

1102
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,930
we don't decide everybody has to agree

1103
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:30,950
on together that you could now decide

1104
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:32,808
separately because the system allows you

1105
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:34,430
to choose the level of rights you have

1106
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:36,980
there and then it compensates through

1107
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:38,240
the level of fine you can decide if you

1108
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,359
want to protect you and your friends

1109
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,709
that way you can do that and then you

1110
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,210
may pay a higher fine but you would

1111
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,970
probably actually get a lower premium in

1112
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:49,099
the sense that if you pick Co liability

1113
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:51,230
say you and a group of friends say we

1114
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:53,900
will each be liable if any one of us is

1115
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:57,530
caught now you don't want to tell on

1116
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:00,859
each other but you also want to prevent

1117
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:02,329
each other from doing things so if you

1118
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:05,420
think about that counterfactual you can

1119
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:07,869
imagine having less to fear from your

1120
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,069
friends and associates telling on you

1121
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:12,140
but of course more to fear that they

1122
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:14,990
will pressure you not to violate crime

1123
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:16,520
laws which would be good if crime laws

1124
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:19,790
were good and obviously bad if crime

1125
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:22,490
laws were bad but again you don't have

1126
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:24,259
to change the level of enforcement of

1127
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,830
crime in general you could just lower

1128
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,110
the

1129
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:33,440
that we suffer from enforcing the laws

1130
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:36,740
that we have I think the comparison of

1131
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:40,670
our width car liability insurance is not

1132
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:42,859
correct because in car accident you no

1133
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:45,800
more talking about not intentional

1134
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:49,190
accident you know it go to running

1135
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,470
someone intentionally and carry

1136
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:55,220
insurance liability insurance covering

1137
00:46:51,470 --> 00:47:00,799
the other party from not intentional

1138
00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:04,399
damage and that's one thing and I don't

1139
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:08,510
like the idea that you are putting in

1140
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:11,480
one bag the criminal laws and people who

1141
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:15,530
would never think of doing any crime and

1142
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:19,730
you automatically putting that light on

1143
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:22,570
every single one saying you will have to

1144
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:26,720
choose a company which you will pay for

1145
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:29,390
to keep an eye on you even if you never

1146
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,480
ever had a intentions to doing something

1147
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:35,180
bad which I don't have to today and with

1148
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,150
your system everyone which no intention

1149
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:41,120
will have to do it not only the crime

1150
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:46,940
potential people but everybody which is

1151
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:49,580
limiting my my all my things freedom if

1152
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:51,080
you don't want them mixed we could have

1153
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,210
you get a separate voucher for

1154
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,400
unintentional versus intentional things

1155
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,590
I'm not sure there's much advantage of

1156
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,880
separating those two making you get two

1157
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:00,920
different vouchers for two different

1158
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,630
categories of things but that would be

1159
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:07,760
possible if it just offends you to have

1160
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:09,260
them those things mixed up but I mean I

1161
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,060
think there's this key intuition that

1162
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,380
people often have today in terms of

1163
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,009
their relationship to States and

1164
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,630
citizens

1165
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:17,210
so for example one of the intuitions

1166
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:18,950
that people have about immigrants is why

1167
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:20,810
should we put ourself at risk

1168
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:23,660
to those people coming in here and then

1169
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:25,160
maybe committing a crime that is those

1170
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,960
people don't have the right to come and

1171
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,670
put us at risk but do you have the right

1172
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,260
though I'm a citizen so I do have the

1173
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:32,180
right to put you at risk in a sense that

1174
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,400
until I've actually done something you

1175
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,259
can't at all consider the possibility

1176
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,700
that I might do something I have a right

1177
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,480
to walk anywhere I want and do anything

1178
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,859
I want and you

1179
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,780
just cannot limit my freedom overall

1180
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:43,660
until I actually do something whereas

1181
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:46,310
with the immigrant you might say they

1182
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,629
they should have to prove that they are

1183
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,980
trustworthy before they're allowed to

1184
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,690
cross the border so think this organ

1185
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:53,930
approach Allah says we're gonna treat

1186
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:55,280
everybody suspiciously everybody is

1187
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,899
going to be someone who might

1188
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,460
potentially do something wrong and that

1189
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,050
we're all going to want them to assure

1190
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,180
us and the fact that you are a citizen

1191
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:04,580
of the same nation does not give us more

1192
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,990
assurance that than if you were an

1193
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:08,509
immigrant we're just going to want

1194
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:10,009
everybody to reassure us you and if you

1195
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:11,540
think about vouching through history has

1196
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:14,270
definitely covered lots of cases where

1197
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,590
people do things intentionally vouching

1198
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:18,259
in history did not just cover

1199
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,990
unintentional things insurance even

1200
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,690
often covers intentional things actually

1201
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:24,709
but vouching definitely has covered

1202
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,040
intentional things that was kind of the

1203
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:27,260
point

1204
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,880
often what if this person from out of

1205
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:31,190
town intentionally does something to

1206
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,020
people in town we need somebody locally

1207
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,810
who will vouch for them and cover that

1208
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,650
case where they do something

1209
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:39,259
unintentional to do something

1210
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:41,840
intentional so yes it's changing the

1211
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:45,080
default of how you're entitled to be

1212
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,640
treated but of course it's the

1213
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:50,060
equivalent in the sense if we subsidize

1214
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,980
you with a pre with a you know premium

1215
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:55,400
subsidy that means that you can have a

1216
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:57,619
very lacks plan then it's kind of

1217
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,420
equivalent to the current system in the

1218
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,950
sense that you could walk around do

1219
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:03,440
anything you want and there's very few

1220
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:05,660
limits on your behavior because this

1221
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,130
voucher is being subsidized right so you

1222
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,990
with my proposal

1223
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,119
there is the option to subsidize various

1224
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:12,410
people's premiums and my proposals

1225
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,170
independent of who you choose to

1226
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:16,910
subsidize how much and so if there are

1227
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:19,010
some people say you know what that

1228
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:20,540
person was a soldier and they they

1229
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:22,160
helped the nation so they should get

1230
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,200
this entitled treatment of not being

1231
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,210
successful you know suspected they

1232
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,890
should be above suspicion fine you can

1233
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:31,400
achieve that outcome through a subsidy

1234
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:34,129
you say fine you get this public option

1235
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,470
say of you make a public option for X

1236
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,630
soldiers who say X soldiers get the

1237
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:41,569
public option you know vouching that

1238
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:44,680
covers the following terms that would be

1239
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:47,960
a thing you could do and people who

1240
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:49,850
don't intend to commit crimes pay for a

1241
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,460
crime enforcement right now through

1242
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,839
taxes anymore so people who don't

1243
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,369
car accidents you have to pay for auto

1244
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,930
insurance people don't intend to have

1245
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:59,150
their car house burned down have to buy

1246
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:02,359
house insurance yes yep

1247
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:04,660
one last question over here yes I have

1248
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:07,040
this concern which is of economic

1249
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:09,020
substance let's say you know the

1250
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,109
stagnation in the u.s. to some extent

1251
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:14,330
the stagnation of income let's say of

1252
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:17,660
workers some extent is attributed to the

1253
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:19,190
lowest lower mobility of Labor people

1254
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,470
are less willing to travel to other

1255
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:23,780
states where opportunity exists so that

1256
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:25,848
they can claim higher wages now it seems

1257
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:29,359
to me that the system that you are

1258
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:31,430
proposing lowers someone's propensity to

1259
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,650
move to another place to seek economic

1260
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:35,899
opportunity because in that place going

1261
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:38,000
to be a stranger it would be much more

1262
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:41,300
expensive for this person to find a

1263
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,560
voucher so there is this one thing but

1264
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,750
the concerns about but also for

1265
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,520
countries that rely on tourism like mine

1266
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,859
that we accept three times our

1267
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,720
population for one week or two weeks you

1268
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:53,598
know to visit our country what would

1269
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,990
happen with those tourists who provide

1270
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,760
them with this kind of coverage so as

1271
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,950
you indicate tourists would also need to

1272
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,000
get temporary vouching if they come into

1273
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,680
a place where everybody needs to be

1274
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,890
vouchers then tourists would also need

1275
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,419
to be vouched but someone was previously

1276
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,950
concerned about the vouchers being to

1277
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,390
large organizations with too much

1278
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:12,799
encompassing you're apparently concerned

1279
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,089
about the opposite that they beat small

1280
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,670
organizations and wouldn't have a

1281
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:19,310
national scope I would expect them to

1282
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:21,770
have sufficient national scope that you

1283
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:24,849
could move from one place to another and

1284
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:26,480
keep the same voucher I in fact I

1285
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:28,430
specify that they'd be long-term

1286
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,619
contracts and so the long-term contracts

1287
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:33,348
unless the voucher specifically told you

1288
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:35,359
you can't move you could move and then

1289
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:37,760
you'd still keep the old voucher that is

1290
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:41,210
they'd still be held to the contract so

1291
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:43,280
again my best default concept is these

1292
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:46,760
are long-term contracts you can get out

1293
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:50,330
of it but they can't and they're they're

1294
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:52,160
priced accordingly and so you would have

1295
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:55,400
if your contract gave the freedom to

1296
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,990
move then you could move and of course

1297
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,599
you know all through history we have

1298
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:02,089
known that cities have been places where

1299
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,580
more crime happened right why exactly

1300
00:53:02,089 --> 00:53:05,849
because you can't know exactly everybody

1301
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,380
in the city and have

1302
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,029
a network of connections that will keep

1303
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,559
them in line that is one of the cost of

1304
00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:12,329
cities has long been and it's a real

1305
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:19,199
cost and it should really be taken to

1306
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:20,880
account ok celebration music end of the

1307
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:30,660
celebration music thank you very much

1308
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:33,390
for your talk and discussion and the

1309
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:36,868
next session here will be the movie

1310
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:40,529
libertas and the presentation of the

1311
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:43,309
