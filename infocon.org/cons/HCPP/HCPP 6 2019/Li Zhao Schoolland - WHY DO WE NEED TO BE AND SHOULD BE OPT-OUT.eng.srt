together in Bogota in Colombia and that

10
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,739
was that is the reason why she's here by

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,670

made in China this is my family I was a

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:48,020
nicest picture before the Communists

23
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:51,729
took everything away from us this

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:58,449
picture was taken in living room of my

25
00:01:51,729 --> 00:02:01,860
grandparents okay

26
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,150
oh that's okay on that side my

27
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,000
great-grandparents and the person sit in

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:10,590
the front is my great grand grandmother

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,260
she has founded feet about this big and

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,600
my parents are on this side and soon

31
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,720
after this wedding picture was taken

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,420
this room no longer no longer belong to

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,650
our family the government said each

34
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,268
family don't need that many rooms and

35
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,760
you have a living room and dining room

36
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:34,060
and bedroom that's too many so they

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,298
placed some other families into our

38
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,110
house and this room particular room had

39
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:48,130
one family with six children and two

40
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:54,069
parents and so that's what the calmness

41
00:02:48,130 --> 00:03:03,100
did after they got in power I was born

42
00:02:54,069 --> 00:03:05,350
in 1958 yes I'm old over 60 and my

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,920
father was a medical doctor my mother

44
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,620
was a English professor sound like a

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,600
very nice family but they later on all

46
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:19,900
became crimes and punished by the

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,090
government oh by the way I'm not going

48
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,769
to read the words on the slides because

49
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:33,430
I have a lot to talk so go ahead and the

50
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:37,269
street and during the time I was a baby

51
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:42,430
in China it's called the period of Great

52
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:47,890
Leap Forward and the Great Leap Forward

53
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:50,620
means the China want to bypass United

54
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,630
States and Great Britain they didn't

55
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,989
know how to sew

56
00:03:52,630 --> 00:04:01,269
Mao Zedong had the idea if we produce

57
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:05,620
enough iron if we produce iron the the

58
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:08,230
total production of iron exceeded Great

59
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,470
Britain and United States then we became

60
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,340
the world power so then we will bypass

61
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:18,130
them

62
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:24,820
so how do we produce enough iron let

63
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:27,100
whole country produce iron so I remember

64
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,190
my mother was a university professor

65
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,389
they all stopped teaching university

66
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:39,370
professors and students all started to

67
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:50,050
produce iron built this little thermos

68
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:50,889
and to to do that let me go back a

69
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,860
little bit

70
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:56,889
the reason the Communists took power and

71
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,979
got a lot of people behind them was they

72
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:02,950
promised the government will take care

73
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:06,120
of everybody and we will give you a

74
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:10,690
total equality we will take the land

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,990
from the landowners and give it to the

76
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:17,919
landless people and we will take the

77
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:20,950
people who has money take their wealth

78
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,440
away and redistribute that sounds so

79
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:27,039
amazing to the people didn't have

80
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:36,520
anything so they all rallied behind Mao

81
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:40,390
so start supporting him and my little

82
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:43,900
brother he might until today my mother

83
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:48,430
still so sorry that when you after he

84
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:52,419
was born he hardly ever had milk and yes

85
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:59,680
56 days it's the government decided

86
00:05:52,419 --> 00:06:05,979
maternity leave and because my parents

87
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:08,500
constantly were taking away for example

88
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:11,650
my father will be sent to countryside to

89
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,650
help the peasants my mother will have to

90
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:18,880
take the students to the countryside to

91
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:22,060
work as Labor's so they were not able to

92
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,230
take care of us and the Communists

93
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:32,020
didn't believe in families so that's why

94
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:34,800
I was in a boarding daycare center which

95
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:40,469
means I get to go home maybe once a week

96
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:45,400
as a baby only less than two months old

97
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:49,690
so we really never experienced the kind

98
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,150
of family life or love of parents

99
00:06:49,690 --> 00:07:00,370
because the Communists didn't believe

100
00:06:52,150 --> 00:07:03,729
that the Communists portrayed a vision

101
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:07,990
of a good life under their their

102
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:10,510
leadership some people told me those

103
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:17,340
posters just like the posters today in

104
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:21,300
North Korea and but the reality was

105
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:27,989
people were dying of starvation or

106
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,990
overworked or beaten to death one of my

107
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:39,700
my grandfather's brother-in-law he was

108
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,039
the chief engineer in a mining company

109
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,190
one of the biggest mining company he was

110
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,110
Western educated and the communist

111
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,010
government put him in prison just

112
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:54,760
because he was Western educated I think

113
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:57,340
in 1963 my grandfather was called to

114
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,349
claim his body from prison and be young

115
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,859
recognition because he was starved

116
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,780
tortured and they couldn't even my

117
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,610
grandfather if if they didn't tell him

118
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:12,900
this is your brother-in-law he wouldn't

119
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:17,470
recognize him and we didn't have

120
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:21,750
furniture I I think we didn't have table

121
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:28,260
so that was our table my brother and I

122
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:31,210
sit there and the reason there was no

123
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:35,169
furniture is because when they tried to

124
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:38,260
make steel they they didn't have coal

125
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,120
enough coal to burn so they start

126
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,270
burning they cut down

127
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:48,880
the trees and start burning furnitures

128
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:51,970
and also they didn't have enough iron

129
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,970
roar we all knew if you want to predict

130
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,580
produce iron you need to have iron roar

131
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:02,490
they didn't have enough fat so what they

132
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:08,070
did was to melt down the ready-made

133
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:11,440
products like pots and pans doorknobs

134
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,140
shovels anything made of iron they melt

135
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,839
them down and and cling them as a

136
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,900
production and they burn the furniture

137
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:30,070
to melt them down so the whole country

138
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:34,390
became just ruined equality is something

139
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:38,500
that come this break about it and they

140
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:41,500
got a lot of support so now today when

141
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,589
you when I hear about people talking

142
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:50,920
about equality I get scared I got goose

143
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:53,880
bumps and starting from 1950 to China's

144
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:59,410
start to nationalized everything

145
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:04,450
factories stores farmland everything was

146
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:07,480
nationalized and they the propaganda

147
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:10,600
told people when unite nationalized you

148
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,420
have higher production you have a better

149
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,850
life everybody will have enough to eat

150
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:24,069
nobody's need to worry about the thing

151
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:30,370
and but the reality proved the opposite

152
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:32,940
and at the beginning everybody was happy

153
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:36,580
working together and eating together

154
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:39,240
eating together means nobody allowed to

155
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:44,040
cook their own meals at home anymore

156
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,950
everybody have to give the government

157
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,490
everything you have the grain such the

158
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:54,010
chickens and pork pigs and vegetables

159
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,950
whatever you have you have to

160
00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:00,760
give it to the unit either you're

161
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:03,700
working unit or your village then they

162
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,250
were assigning somebody to cook the meal

163
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,520
everybody ate together at the very

164
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,920
beginning everybody was happy because it

165
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,500
was like a feast every day China was

166
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,469
still poor that time now the family had

167
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:21,220
food but they didn't have enough food so

168
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:26,610
usually the mother of the family will

169
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:30,760
plan we have this much of flour or rice

170
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:33,910
we will plan we eat certain amount each

171
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,220
day so it will last long time until next

172
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:40,230
time we can have some so they have

173
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:43,660
planning but when you give to the

174
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,600
community they don't plan they cook

175
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,839
everything up and like a feast they say

176
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,050
oh wow everybody was so happy like New

177
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:57,360
Year's feast every day but very very

178
00:11:53,050 --> 00:12:04,270
soon maybe only a few weeks everything

179
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:10,420
went out no more food so the government

180
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:14,199
came with new policy and said everybody

181
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,870
start eating less and to help the

182
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,680
country we have to eat less and also be

183
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:24,670
creative find other things substitute

184
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:30,579
for food so in the tray of that boy

185
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:34,209
those are clay and grass and some

186
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:36,430
sometimes are Oh bye bye then all the

187
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:40,240
temples in China Buddhist temples were

188
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:42,189
closed so they have a big container of

189
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,440
ashes from the past

190
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,620
I don't know hundred years of 200 years

191
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:52,450
a lot of ashes all of these those things

192
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:57,700
were food at that time basically it was

193
00:12:52,450 --> 00:13:00,130
anything that didn't kill you it's you

194
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:06,070
should eat as food just to fill your

195
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:07,810
stomach and today lot of people talk

196
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,709
about Chinese they said Oh

197
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:14,109
these people eat everything that can fly

198
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:17,888
except airplane everything has legs

199
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:24,069
except table and chairs now you know why

200
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:34,899
because the situation forced us to be

201
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:37,839
that way those people are getting tree

202
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:39,730
barks of the tree of course they don't

203
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,980
have knifes or shuffles anymore because

204
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:45,579
they were melded so they have another

205
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:50,769
tricks to get the tree barks and to eat

206
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:54,388
and my father was sent to a countryside

207
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:57,999
to help the people people were dying as

208
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:59,680
hundreds every day I remember walking on

209
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:03,550
the street seeing people just laying

210
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:09,599
that dead on the sidewalk and he was

211
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:09,599
called to the village chiefs home and

212
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:16,269
when he walked in he saw this guy laying

213
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:19,990
in bed couldn't move I have a very

214
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:22,629
ballsy stomach and he couldn't talk

215
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,420
anymore said what happened I asked the

216
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:27,759
family they said well he suppose he's

217
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,420
the Communist Party leader he's supposed

218
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:35,439
to let other people have food first

219
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:37,899
but he got so hungry he couldn't stand

220
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:45,670
up anymore he went home he laid down and

221
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:48,519
start to take this pillow the inside of

222
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:51,729
the pillow start eating that pudding in

223
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:55,889
his mouth of course that's will not

224
00:14:51,730 --> 00:15:03,429
digest it just stuck in his tummy

225
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:07,120
if that happens every day and the whole

226
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:10,839
nation was in starvation we called and

227
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,970
they are swollen and they're so fatigued

228
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:18,269
they couldn't do anything they couldn't

229
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:18,269
work they could just sit there

230
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:27,009
and the theft became a biggest crime

231
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:31,509
during that time because people are so

232
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:34,929
hungry especially kids so they will go

233
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:41,069
to the government warehouse a village

234
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:46,869
warehouse to grab something to eat and

235
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:50,949
anything the route they will take up to

236
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:52,059
eat I remember my brother will find a

237
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,929
hole on the ground

238
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:58,539
he knew this film ice in there he will

239
00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:01,358
block this side of hole and burn some

240
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:04,509
grass on the other side and force the

241
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:09,309
mice to come out and they roasted to eat

242
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:12,220
I I didn't eat it I was not that hungry

243
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:17,858
so I didn't eat mice but my brother did

244
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:22,929
and another very popular punishment is

245
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:25,479
bury people alive they did they invent

246
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:28,029
it that way when you get buried up to

247
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:31,179
your neck you just couldn't breathe

248
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:36,549
anymore and people just watch you too

249
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:40,709
until your last breath and die those are

250
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:40,709
all true stories

251
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:59,189
because everything was nationalized so

252
00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:04,129
the government became the planner of the

253
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:13,500
whole economy of the country so during

254
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:20,990
1950 up to the middle of 1980 China was

255
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,990
on today's standard how extreme poverty

256
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:27,949
compared to Latin America or even Africa

257
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:46,110
first the government fabricated a model

258
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:50,210
saying okay this village they can

259
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:54,860
produce very high yield of the crops

260
00:17:50,210 --> 00:18:01,230
each year actually they they cheated

261
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:07,879
they put all the seats and all the

262
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:15,679
fertilizer all the water in one pot one

263
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:20,159
piece of land and then it was a human to

264
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:24,870
get air through the thick plant so

265
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:28,320
produce a very high yield of harvest and

266
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,418
they invited mounted on to visit most of

267
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,158
them say oh you're gray so that's become

268
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:39,000
the coda and standard for the whole

269
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:44,580
country and also Mao Zedong says God

270
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,809
didn't make the world perfect we people

271
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,250
have to correct

272
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:52,408
God's mistake so the mountains are

273
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:55,639
troublesome we have to change the

274
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:59,669
mountains we have to make mountains into

275
00:18:55,639 --> 00:19:01,799
farmlands that's why those terraces now

276
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:02,520
in a lot of people go to China today

277
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,150
these

278
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:09,180
they go there as a tourist attraction I

279
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:13,320
hate it so much because all the work put

280
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:16,770
in there I remember going to the

281
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,889
mountains every day to dig to cut down

282
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:23,910
the bamboos and trees and then put the

283
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:26,460
move the stones and make it terraces and

284
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:28,590
there was no water so we have to carry

285
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:34,500
the water from below

286
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:38,850
walk up to pour the water into the

287
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:41,550
terraces and they're so small the little

288
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,909
each pieces it couldn't use machines so

289
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:53,129
all men till the land doing all the

290
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:58,740
harvests in there and planting and they

291
00:19:53,130 --> 00:20:00,660
also said rivers are not planned very

292
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,990
well because they take a lot of land

293
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:07,940
some rivers are whiny take a lot of land

294
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:11,430
so we have to change the rivers as well

295
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,700
there was a river in our village whiny

296
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:18,780
River it's been there from the beginning

297
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:21,860
of time and our religion chief said oh

298
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:24,680
this we we don't have enough production

299
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:28,500
because we didn't have enough farmland

300
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,600
actually that was not true but they

301
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,300
couldn't understand why the government

302
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,649
told us what to do and not we're not

303
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:43,560
getting the same result so they made us

304
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:48,030
to take a new river straight and we

305
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:52,710
worked day and night duck this river on

306
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:57,720
the day that River finally finished

307
00:20:52,710 --> 00:21:00,600
which celebrated and then they blocked

308
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,750
the old river and redirect the water to

309
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,870
the new river within a few minutes all

310
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:11,940
the water disappeared because the new

311
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:15,250
River the riverbed was dry the soil now

312
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:19,230
all the water just soaked in

313
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:23,740
and then become a river you've got

314
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:28,180
running but the old river the riverbed

315
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,620
was sand it couldn't it didn't have soil

316
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,550
you couldn't plan anything nothing

317
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:37,629
growth in scent so we lost the old river

318
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:41,200
we wasted land just for new river and we

319
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,800
had no more water the entire area had no

320
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:49,900
more water

321
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:53,470
I remember the area we were living the

322
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:58,420
soil is was not good for planting rice

323
00:21:53,470 --> 00:22:01,420
but the government's that all the land

324
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:03,910
of salsa Yangtze River have to plan rice

325
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:09,790
north of Yangtze River have to plant

326
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:12,930
wheat the area I was living the soil was

327
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:17,080
very cliquey it was good for tobacco and

328
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:21,490
peanuts but those are considered cash

329
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,860
crops they were not a market allowed so

330
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,470
you can't you were not allowed to plant

331
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,979
anything that you have to sell or you

332
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:36,250
can sell so everybody have to plant food

333
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:38,920
for yourself so when we put the harvest

334
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:42,870
we're never met Lakota government gave

335
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:46,720
us so we plant two times a year and

336
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:49,600
still not enough so become triple

337
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,420
cropping plants three times a year the

338
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,330
soil never get rested there's not not

339
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,370
enough nutrients oil and not enough

340
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,919
water

341
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:04,449
there's no fertilizer I remember in the

342
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:11,050
terraces the soil is so hard so we were

343
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:12,640
just personally step on the soil we

344
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,639
walked back and forth back and forth

345
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,810
just step on the soil make it softer

346
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:24,360
then we plant at the end of the year we

347
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:28,240
harvest less than we the seat we put in

348
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,100
the government came in asked the farmers

349
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,900
to give

350
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:36,959
the amount of food agreeing that to meet

351
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,809
the coda when the farmer worked all year

352
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,820
long they give everything hundred

353
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:45,149
percent to the government is still 10

354
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:48,928
meter coda so they end up have to borrow

355
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:54,150
the food from the government year after

356
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:57,450
year they are always in debt let me tell

357
00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:00,059
you how poor we were the farmers work

358
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:05,309
all year long plant rice but they could

359
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:11,309
only afford to eat cooked rice one meal

360
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:14,340
a year that was Chinese New Year one

361
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:16,020
meal a year and only the manga to eat

362
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:20,809
because that area

363
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:24,240
women and men don't have equal status

364
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:27,570
the rest of the year they have a big pot

365
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,740
of water they put one handful of rice

366
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:34,350
into it making a soup I remember when I

367
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:39,210
had the bowl of soup every day I could

368
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:41,908
count the greens in nice soup that

369
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:45,090
little and there's no market nobody

370
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:50,159
allowed to grow vegetables so we have

371
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:52,199
salt and I remember I plant some chili

372
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,900
pepper because it doesn't require all

373
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,570
the land I just find the little sidewalk

374
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:02,250
and plant some chili pepper chili pepper

375
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:09,030
and salt mixed together and that's we

376
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:15,270
add the taste to that watery soup and we

377
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:18,389
get 2 litres oil per year 2 liters per

378
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:21,629
year so what we did we have chopsticks

379
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:26,820
dip into the oil bottle and drop two

380
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:28,950
drops in that salt and pepper mix now

381
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,379
you go to China you see their food there

382
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:34,370
fill with oil because now they have

383
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:39,480
enough people are just go overboard

384
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:42,168
because just because we can afford not

385
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,690
because they love it

386
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:46,260
that was our life and I thought to

387
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,669
myself

388
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:55,320
farmers were the producers of food even

389
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:59,000
we were this poor what about the whole

390
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,000
country what's wrong

391
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:09,139
our neighbor have six people in the

392
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:13,408
family they only have one pair of pants

393
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:15,719
everybody in the house naked because I

394
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:18,080
have no clothes of course they didn't

395
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,659
have electricity it's always dark and

396
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,240
whoever need to go out get to wear that

397
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:27,809
pair of pants and that pair pants

398
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:34,639
already nobody knew what original fabric

399
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:39,649
because those patched up in cities

400
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:42,529
that's the vision of the Communist Party

401
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:47,010
Mao Zedong's vision of cities

402
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:57,149
industrialized and the reality almost

403
00:26:47,010 --> 00:27:00,779
like that and all the production was

404
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:05,639
plan so the government said we we know

405
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:09,450
what's best for you what you need so

406
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:13,289
we'll make enough for you and they have

407
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:17,130
all these posters lot of products and

408
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:21,450
lot of food but reality was everything

409
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:23,779
was in shortage so this on this side

410
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:27,500
this night in 1962

411
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:31,769
starting from 1962 until all the way to

412
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:35,130
almost the end of 1980 everything have

413
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:36,809
coupons I think probably in the Eastern

414
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:44,190
European countries you might have that

415
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:49,289
to food we have green oil meat even

416
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:53,190
pastry a bread and clothing we have for

417
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:55,590
shoes for clothes for fabric for yarn

418
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:59,720
and other

419
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:04,560
we have almost everything matches

420
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:08,580
cigarette salt sugar everything is a

421
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:12,659
ration even with coupon is that with

422
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:16,740
coupon you have to fight to buy by them

423
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:19,410
I remember my brother and I we were so

424
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,810
little sometimes we got to the front of

425
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:24,450
the line those big people just kick us

426
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:27,629
out we end up getting anything

427
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:31,770
and this just tiny small basket or

428
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:43,800
potato that many people are fighting to

429
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:46,710
to buy with a Koopa this is that the

430
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,520
last thing the food shortage is no

431
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:52,190
longer true in China but this is still

432
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,750
true today

433
00:28:52,190 --> 00:29:06,330
one person want the entire country think

434
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:09,330
exactly as he thinks cheating things

435
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:13,139
like that most of those like that that's

436
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:15,510
why the Cultural Revolution because also

437
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,360
don't think the problem of China is

438
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:31,110
people don't have correct way of

439
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:37,379
thinking my father just said the joke

440
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:42,030
about my wife to another doctor doing a

441
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:47,180
surgery and right after that the other

442
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:52,889
doctor turned him in because to gain

443
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:56,990
political favor or to be safe for

444
00:29:52,890 --> 00:30:02,240
himself you always have to do something

445
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:06,210
that to prove that you are your good and

446
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,480
so by turning somebody else in that if

447
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,480
you

448
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:17,820
some credit some protection today is the

449
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:18,449
same they encourage people to turn each

450
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:26,369
other in

451
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:32,149
for this Social Credit thing this is how

452
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:38,279
the right guard treated the

453
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:46,559
intellectuals or the people they don't

454
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:49,700
like they have a big sign made of plat

455
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:57,720
would usually very heavy and the wire

456
00:30:49,700 --> 00:31:00,809
usually is a thin metal wire will cut

457
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:06,090
into your skin and you're supposed to

458
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:10,190
carry that all day long maybe 12 12 15

459
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:13,379
hours a day 20 hours a day whatever and

460
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:16,769
so the longer you carry it in hurts and

461
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:20,158
you the lower you bend because in

462
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:22,619
Chinese culture when you bend means

463
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:26,340
you're kowtow to other people you're

464
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:28,738
inferior so the purpose is for you to

465
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:36,559
really lower your head as low as

466
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:38,539
possible and this is called the

467
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,928
jet-propelled

468
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:47,029
position they just pull your arm as high

469
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:50,940
as possible so you bend very low and

470
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:54,779
they divided people into two kinds black

471
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:59,269
and red we are all black people black is

472
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:03,629
at the beginning we call five black

473
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:08,940
landowners rich people counter

474
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:13,709
revolutionaries bad people and right

475
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:16,679
wing the number four is the funniest is

476
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:18,960
called bad people we say who is bad

477
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,499
people anybody they don't like is bad

478
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,259
people

479
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:23,929
so until today we often joke oh you're

480
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:27,330
number four

481
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:32,360
the bad people and later they expanded

482
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:37,019
to nine educated speak foreign language

483
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:39,360
educated in the other country returned

484
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:41,909
from other country have been to Taiwan

485
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,758
have been to Hong Kong everything added

486
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:49,620
on and became nine categories our family

487
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:52,799
was in all these categories they're

488
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:55,709
educated my mother's my father they all

489
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,789
spoke English and my grandparents spoke

490
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:01,500
English they're capitalists they were

491
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:04,700
bank owners they're factory owners

492
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:11,100
they're store owners and so we are very

493
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:13,139
black when we going to for example two

494
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:18,059
train station there's two exits two

495
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:21,240
entrances one for red one for black one

496
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:24,450
time I asked my mother I said why can't

497
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:30,360
we just pretend we're red because nobody

498
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:32,940
no knows us here and I don't want to go

499
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,049
to the black because the black people

500
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,480
can spit on you kick you beat you up and

501
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:41,789
they push you away and sometimes they

502
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,899
won't let you get on the train I said I

503
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:48,658
don't want that my mom said well no

504
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:52,320
because they can tell we're not red

505
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:54,720
because our manners educated people have

506
00:33:52,320 --> 00:34:00,418
different manners and if they find out

507
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:04,279
you cheated you're dead so we didn't

508
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:07,919
even fear to pretend we're not black and

509
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:11,699
in school black kids are not allowed to

510
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,060
participate any in any extracurricular

511
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:17,790
activities until today I didn't know how

512
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,649
to sing or dance or draw or anything

513
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:23,239
because we're not allowed to learn all

514
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:27,210
these things because we're black and

515
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:31,439
only red kids red kisses you have to be

516
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:38,119
eight generations illiterate didn't own

517
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,119
anything very poor then you're red

518
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,980
by the way she's in Kings father had

519
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:51,779
these kind of treatment to I don't know

520
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:54,120
what's wrong with him he just didn't

521
00:34:51,780 --> 00:35:02,220
remember or he he didn't think that's

522
00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:05,310
bad and these things the way they write

523
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:11,970
your name is it's also indication of

524
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:16,140
your crime if they write it in the

525
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:21,000
correct direction and you are not so

526
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:24,620
severely bad if they put your name the

527
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,070
character upside down or tilted your

528
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:32,580
your little your crime is deeper if you

529
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:37,350
have a cross it's even worse your the

530
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:40,020
cross is red means death penalty so for

531
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:43,380
me and my my little brother we didn't

532
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,480
know what my mother's crime was every

533
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,810
day we tried to go onto the street to

534
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,710
peek how her name was written on the on

535
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:59,790
the on the wall or on her sign and we

536
00:35:52,710 --> 00:36:03,500
will know her faith and people just yeah

537
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:07,259
execution daily hundreds of people and

538
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:11,330
those people are a shot dead already

539
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:17,250
of course bearing a life that's another

540
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:20,310
common thing a lot of people after day

541
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:25,050
after day especially elderly people they

542
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:28,860
just drop dead on on the stage and they

543
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:32,220
also not only put you on tables and

544
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:35,810
chairs on stage to criticize you after

545
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:39,930
that usually they give you a gong you

546
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:43,830
chant it march on the street and say I'm

547
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:48,220
so-and-so I'm like my crime was this and

548
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:50,560
that and people just bystanders just

549
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:54,509
spit on you kick you and threw stone on

550
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:59,759
you like that every day my mom was

551
00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:04,000
marched around campus on the street and

552
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:07,510
one day we and my brother and I oh by

553
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,319
the way that time our schools were

554
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:14,079
closed so we didn't have school to go to

555
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:17,440
so we were we're at home and we heard

556
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,990
noise coming to our house we knew

557
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,450
something's wrong then we walk out we

558
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:26,828
saw the red guard dragging my mother

559
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:30,339
coming to our our house and they they

560
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:35,050
they made a circle like this and forces

561
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:38,470
my brother and I in the front and told

562
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:44,890
us tell us what did your parents teach

563
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:48,970
you to against the communists of course

564
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:51,098
my parents never told us that and we

565
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:53,799
just didn't say anything

566
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:56,200
I hope my brother's hand we refused to

567
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,980
say anything and they start beating up

568
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:03,700
my mom in front of us say no this is

569
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:07,150
evidence you taught your children to

570
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:14,049
refuse the Communists they just beat her

571
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:18,930
up in front of us another day a group of

572
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:22,359
Red Guard came to our house and just

573
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:25,180
ransacked everything and took all my

574
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:28,720
father's shoes to a pile in the front of

575
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:30,578
the house to burn it and you look at you

576
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:36,730
you have more than one pair of shoes

577
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:38,859
you're you're such a bad people and then

578
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:40,990
my mother's clothes and western style

579
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:43,660
clothes they're shredded into shreds and

580
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:45,490
the pictures they burn all our photos

581
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,049
they said look at these people they

582
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:51,189
dressed so nicely they still have a

583
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:54,460
smile on their face how evil so they

584
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:58,050
burn all the other things and force my

585
00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:01,050
brother and I watch it and my

586
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:01,050
great-grandmother

587
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:09,299
she never worked on her life

588
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:13,169
and she was forced to to weed the long

589
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:25,180
outside in in the Sun in the public and

590
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:30,609
she died very soon after that and people

591
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:34,269
just yeah execution is daily then our

592
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:36,910
family was sent to the countryside as I

593
00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:40,919
said earlier that's how we kill the land

594
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:50,078
we didn't have animals we just carried

595
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:52,509
things we were constantly being

596
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,029
relocated a lot of people asked me where

597
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:57,699
are you from from China as I can tell we

598
00:39:55,029 --> 00:40:01,029
didn't we couldn't decide where we want

599
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:05,249
to live the government just makes you

600
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:08,410
live here and live there everything was

601
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:11,680
controlled by the government even who

602
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:14,259
you date how many times you can husband

603
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,180
and wife can sleep together everything

604
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:19,569
was determined by the government

605
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,788
you had no freedom people often ask me

606
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:25,690
how did why do you dress so nicely I

607
00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:28,180
said just because I can because the

608
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:31,779
first 20-some years of my life I

609
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:35,288
couldn't I have no choice my hair style

610
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:38,940
my clothes I didn't have choice now I'm

611
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:38,940
celebrating my freedom I

612
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:51,469
so this is my horror story but it didn't

613
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:55,999
end it very bad poorly so we had a

614
00:40:51,469 --> 00:40:58,009
better ending and now my brother lives

615
00:40:55,999 --> 00:41:00,439
in Kansas in the United States my

616
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:03,409
parents they're 86 years old

617
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:07,038
they lived in Dallas Texas and they're

618
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:10,519
retired and my husband and I we live in

619
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:22,159
in Hawaii we are very happy we count our

620
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:25,578
blessings every single day they do a lot

621
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:31,269
of things to us they could if we don't

622
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:36,189
say no if we don't opt out just like

623
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:42,078
today in Hong Kong the new law of no

624
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:46,069
covering on your face no mask people

625
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:50,390
came out of tens of thousands everybody

626
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:55,130
was wearing a face mask today they say

627
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:57,158
no and but unfortunately there's not a

628
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:00,349
lot of support especially

629
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:03,919
internationally I heard the president of

630
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:06,559
Czech Republic us think China is such a

631
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:10,449
great model they want the country look

632
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,449
up to see the king and to China

633
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:33,300
[Applause]

634
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:36,750
so Thank You Lee for in very impressive

635
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:41,820
presentation and I think we have a time

636
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:46,770
for questions don't hesitate and ask we

637
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:50,490
want about the situation in China Hong

638
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:54,180
Kong u.s. the thing I'm talking about

639
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:56,790
it's not very long ago and today a lot

640
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:00,509
of things still the same that's why it's

641
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:03,540
the scary part and people don't realize

642
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:05,700
they look at the high-rises and all the

643
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,850
infrastructures beautiful shops and

644
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:16,759
expensive things in China those are on

645
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:16,759
surface people live in fears still yes

646
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:27,960
do and do you know if these things are

647
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:31,680
happening currently in North Korea we

648
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,530
have a very limited technology about

649
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:38,040
what's going on there very very few so

650
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:40,530
and we even had a speaker about that but

651
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:44,690
he cancelled so anything you know it

652
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:48,240
would be very useful yes I saw some

653
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:49,010
films and footages and photos from North

654
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,770
Korea

655
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:56,850
all Chinese laughed my generation they

656
00:43:52,770 --> 00:44:01,890
said exactly the same we we can just

657
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:07,620
imagine exactly the same but I have met

658
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:10,770
many defectors from North Korea they

659
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:16,020
told me there's some hope in my opinion

660
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:21,750
there's some hope because the North

661
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:31,460
Korean government officials realized the

662
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:36,630
power of money and good life so they are

663
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:39,559
very corruptible I never thought

664
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:42,939
corruption is good but in North Korea

665
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:47,390
is good because I give you two examples

666
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:52,848
one example is my friend her name is

667
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:56,689
praise she's Christian her family next

668
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:59,150
time you invite her she how they escaped

669
00:44:56,689 --> 00:45:02,149
one by one and all these terrible things

670
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:06,349
and now they're supporting Christians in

671
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:09,019
North Korea and one day I was visiting

672
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:11,539
her she said oh we just one church got

673
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:14,328
in trouble my father had to go to

674
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:16,640
Washington DC I said for what Oh to to

675
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:20,449
raise funds to send to North Korea

676
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,299
I said why she said if we give them

677
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:25,969
enough money those Church people

678
00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:27,229
detained they will be fine no problem oh

679
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:30,199
good

680
00:45:27,229 --> 00:45:34,009
hurry up sent money there to corrupt

681
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:39,140
those those people another guy I met he

682
00:45:34,009 --> 00:45:42,769
his parents was very powerful in North

683
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:45,589
Korea he went to China as delegate for

684
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:49,569
some kind of things in China he said he

685
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:52,130
just walked into South Korean embassy

686
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:55,038
defected I said what about your family

687
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:57,229
when you defect your family going to be

688
00:45:55,039 --> 00:46:00,739
in trouble and put into concentration

689
00:45:57,229 --> 00:46:07,218
him he said no we our family had enough

690
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:10,849
money we just pay I said okay that's at

691
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:13,910
least better than we were we had no way

692
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:16,339
of doing anything because the whole

693
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:19,969
country is closed and also China built a

694
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:24,859
lot of power satellite tower near the

695
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:28,400
border and also use drone to drop

696
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:31,189
cellphones so people had cell phone and

697
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:37,189
they get connected to outside the world

698
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:43,069
and I knew a person also smuggle South

699
00:46:37,189 --> 00:46:46,578
Korean TV dramas because when they watch

700
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:48,439
that they say what you can have life

701
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:50,080
like that you can fall in love with

702
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:53,549
people

703
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:58,690
you can choose who you want to love and

704
00:46:53,550 --> 00:47:02,290
marry to that huge impact those South

705
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:04,030
Korean drama in North Korea a lot of

706
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:08,279
people of course because they caught

707
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:11,560
watching it those dramas and put in the

708
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,320
concentration camp and some died one guy

709
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:17,650
escaped he was a medical doctor now his

710
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:22,410
mission is sending also the other group

711
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:22,410
people are collecting thumb drives and

712
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:35,050
fill with information and sent to North

713
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:35,980
Korea so technology wonderful this

714
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,910
reminds me

715
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:42,400
one article I wrote last year and the

716
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:47,259
name of the article is how corruption is

717
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,630
or can save lives human lives and I I

718
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:52,090
mentioned specifically the situation in

719
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:54,490
Panama because in Panama you have like

720
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:58,360
really a lot of immigrants from

721
00:47:54,490 --> 00:48:01,629
Venezuela and just thanks to bribes

722
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:04,420
these Venezuelan people paid to local

723
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:06,690
Panamanian bike rats they can stay there

724
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:09,970
in Panama in a completely illegal way

725
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:13,270
because if they stop paying bribes they

726
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:15,129
will be like put back to Venezuela so

727
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,670
these also and they probably died in

728
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:20,050
Venezuela so these also the reason how

729
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:23,050
corruption is basically saving human

730
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:27,880
lives anyway I have another question for

731
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:30,100
you so now there is a really bad

732
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:34,720
conflict almost wurr conflict between

733
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:40,690
China and Hong Kong so do you think that

734
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:43,870
if China takes control over over the

735
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:49,350
Hong Kong / Hong Kong that the next

736
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:52,630
country next week victim will be Taiwan

737
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:53,580
yes and no I don't think China is that

738
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:58,120
powerful

739
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:59,830
they can't even Hong Kong they have to

740
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:03,279
compromise Chinese government have to

741
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:03,940
compromise but if Taiwan if people in

742
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,290
Hong Kong

743
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:11,410
as an Stan form it's going to be

744
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:14,040
dangerous the issue right now in Hong

745
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:16,569
Kong is there's no leader

746
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:19,210
maybe they may be different difference

747
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:21,100
is that Taiwan is like according to them

748
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,870
it's official Republic of China you know

749
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,970
that right and the Taiwan is each

750
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:28,299
established they have their government

751
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:31,990
they have their own rule of law they

752
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:36,450
have their there is country so no China

753
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:38,830
cannot if there's fight in war Chinese

754
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:42,009
military you know some people maybe

755
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:48,100
watch two Chinese military parade last

756
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:52,990
week there was our fake because they

757
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:56,890
want to tell the people our country is

758
00:49:52,990 --> 00:50:01,569
very powerful they want to they lie to

759
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:04,839
the people and a lot of interesting

760
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:08,620
details they put each person's pants

761
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:11,830
have a little what you called gadget

762
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:16,690
making noise so that when they walk the

763
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:21,549
noise very loud so impressive and

764
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:24,190
they put a need needle on their color so

765
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:27,370
if they everybody's head have to be a

766
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:32,590
certain way if you tilt it you get

767
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:35,049
pinched by the needle and they choose

768
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:37,540
some people not even in the military

769
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:41,560
those models they have to have the same

770
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:43,720
height right and the very fit looks very

771
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:48,100
handsome so they get all these people

772
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:52,000
pretend they practice walking that for

773
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:56,560
how many months maybe up to a year but

774
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,790
they don't practice battles shooting or

775
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:04,870
things and all all of the Chinese

776

military commanders after certain rank

777
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:16,720
all but you have to pay certain amount

778
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:19,900
of money to be immune giving the rank

779
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:24,910
okay the more money you pay the higher

780
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:31,359
rank you are not because of your skills

781
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:33,940
your whatever and I was so shocked and

782
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:36,279

no Chinese military soldiers can serve

790
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:04,329
