1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,279
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,319
so i'll begin

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,360
uh the topic of today's talk is around

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,679
slavery to sovereignty the reason i've

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,519
chosen this topic is because

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,599
i've come to the conclusion that slavery

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,199
is not just something that occurs

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,680
in a digital platform so a lot of year

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,439
this event perhaps would be looking at

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:21,760
it

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
in a way that how do we escape the

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,320
financial system which would be digital

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,519
how do we escape

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,039
the surveillance state the state of

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,119
surveillance or you know

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,520
applications that we use but slavery

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,320
expands

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,640
far beyond the realm of digital so it is

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,239
good to focus on the digital

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,559
i wanted to expand it and show you how

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,920
slavery

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,160
affects each and every single one of us

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
through various

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,840
categories whether it's digital uh

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,200
whether it's through the mind whether

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,520
it's

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
your body whether it's your health and a

28
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,039
lot of interactions that you may have

29
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,559
day-to-day

30
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,239
could be chained up without you even

31
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,079
knowing it so that's why i've chosen

32
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,960
this topic

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
and i would like to show you how as an

34
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
individual i have personally

35
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,200
uh strive to break the chains that have

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,920
you know helped onto so many people in

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,040
life

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,720
so without further ado i would like to

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
begin on that topic

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,439
so my name is amin rafi you can look

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,119
into my background my website is

42
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,360
mentioned

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,320
on this slide and you can look into my

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,759
other videos and everything else i've

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,200
done

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
so my goal from the start was to see how

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,720
decentralization could impact society it

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
was very important for me to see

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,280
how this could be related to various

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,920
countries

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,200
and various uh let's say cultures so

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,799
for me it was very interesting to see

53
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,799
how blockchain was being

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,280
applied in the netherlands in germany in

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,200
cyprus in australia

56
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
and in mexico and various other

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,119
countries that i've

58
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,719
kind of lived in along the way by taking

59
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,280
these examples i was able to see

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,719
a nice depiction on how a society

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,160
functions so for example

62
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,959
in the netherlands i really like the

63
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,160
communities there

64
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,840
and the way that they apply it in

65
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
australia due to a lot of the population

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,239
for example studying business or finance

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,840
i didn't see too many things that

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,080
excited me it was mainly being used in

69
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,000
logistics or finance

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
uh so for me the most exciting

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
applications of blockchain were

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,720
in fact in the netherlands germany and

73
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,280
of course

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,720
uh slovakia and in mexico

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,519
again due to a lot of corruption and a

76
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,200
lot of things that have occurred

77
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
uh you know it was hard to establish a

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,319
base with people

79
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,120
where you could get them to want to use

80
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,599
a

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,239
digital currency because uh in the past

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,000
there have been a lot of crap [ __ ] and

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,640
you know

84
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
people's monies have been lost so

85
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040
they're very attached to cash

86
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,560
so it was interesting to see these

87
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,959
things so that's my background i've kind

88
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,319
of traveled around and

89
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,879
done workshops talks wherever i could to

90
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,720
educate people on these topics

91
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,879
i've also like to work on myself so as i

92
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,400
said slavery for me isn't just the

93
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,959
digital

94
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,879
realm i like to break the chains in

95
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,319
various aspects of my life

96
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
so for seven years during the time that

97
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,200
i lived across three continents over 12

98
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,760
countries

99
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,159
i did live on cryptocurrencies um at

100
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,599
first it was very hard

101
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,680
you know using local bitcoins exchanging

102
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,720
it for cash

103
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
and other stages i expanded this to

104
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,239
using you know uh

105
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,920
bitcoin debit cards or the visa cards

106
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
this made it much easier for me to

107
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,560
interact with society obviously

108
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,319
because you could just go to an atm and

109
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,920
go about your day

110
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480
by using cash so it was interesting for

111
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,440
me to also

112
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,920
see how i could use crypto while living

113
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
across three different continents

114
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
usually it's quite complex to use it in

115
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,080
one country

116
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,319
let alone applying it to more than a

117
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,920
dozen countries across three different

118
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
continents

119
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,360
though again a lot of tools came up such

120
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
as the bitcoin debit card that really

121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
really helped me

122
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,400
and you know some of them have gone

123
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
missing some of them have shut down

124
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,720
though there are still bits and pieces

125
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
of these organizations that allow you to

126
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,200
use such

127
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,040
systems so while i'm going around

128
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
i'm trying to find the truth uh trying

129
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
to find ways to free my mind free my

130
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
body and free myself from the digital

131
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
realm as well so

132
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,560
these digital tools really help

133
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,800
one of the most important things that i

134
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
kind of came across

135
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
to realize is there's no such thing as

136
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,160
anarchy we live in an

137
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,479
inverted world that the focus is always

138
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,000
on the other side right

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,479
there is only tyranny so when we speak

140
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,560
about anarchy we always say oh we're you

141
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
know those who are fighting the system

142
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,560
but why are we fighting the system the

143
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
real problem is that we have tyranny is

144
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,000
that we have suppression

145
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,880
of ideologies of people's freedoms

146
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,240
liberty isn't something that we should

147
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
have to fight for

148
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,120
why do we have governments that we have

149
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
to request that freedom to be given to

150
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,759
us

151
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,479
rather than uh you know it being a

152
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,840
normal thing

153
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
so it's funny to really look at the

154
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,520
whole scenario of anarchy and kind of

155
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,960
come to the realization

156
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,120
that there is no anarchy there is only

157
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,479
those who suppress

158
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,560
and once you understand that it changes

159
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,240
your whole paradigm

160
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,160
on how you deal with society and other

161
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,840
things among it

162
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
so when we look at slavery it affects

163
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
our lives in many different forms as i

164
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:30,960
mentioned

165
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,800
it's beyond digital it can be your mind

166
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
it can be your body it can be your

167
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,720
health

168
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,440
um you know as an individual you could

169
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
be

170
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,759
needed to rely on medication as an

171
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,280
individual you may need to

172
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,240
attend a job to pay off a debt and that

173
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,280
you have

174
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,680
kind of linked yourself to and in the

175
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
digital world we have many tools that

176
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
people use on a daily basis so your work

177
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
may request that you use certain

178
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,240
applications that may

179
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
require to scan your face for example to

180
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,520
log in

181
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,440
so there's lots of different aspects in

182
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,680
interacting with society that may change

183
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,560
you

184
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,120
so my aim was always to break away from

185
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
these kind of

186
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,720
limitations in life and to introduce

187
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
some sort of a liberty

188
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,319
but to understand how powerful as an

189
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,759
individual i could be

190
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,160
i would first have to see where i am

191
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,039
tied

192
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,680
and where i am limited and where i am as

193
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,400
slave

194
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
so i was a slave on many different

195
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,160
aspects of my life without even

196
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,880
realizing

197
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,280
one of the things i was slave to was

198
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
comfort you know

199
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,520
as a person from originally from iran

200
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,199
obviously the cold temperature was not

201
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,240
something that i

202
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,400
was accustomed to and then living in

203
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,759
australia which was also a

204
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
warm climate so while in the netherlands

205
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,360
i wanted to break this

206
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
slavery that i had to temperature and

207
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,039
conditioning that

208
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,080
was predisposed and from doing so i was

209
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
hoping that my mind could be altered

210
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,120
so then i could figure out what else it

211
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,520
is

212
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,759
that i am holding on to that should not

213
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,520
be there that may limit me

214
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,360
so it's not so much that the cold

215
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,840
bothered me but removal of that fear

216
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
allows me to expand in other parts of my

217
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
life that you may not realize at that

218
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,360
time

219
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
so i did that in the netherlands i

220
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
trained myself to be able to withstand

221
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,120
extreme cold temperatures whether it's

222
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
sitting in a frozen lake or sitting in

223
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,759
the snow

224
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,240
and this had huge impacts on other parts

225
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,319
of my life because removal of fear

226
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,280
is liberty in itself emancipation from

227
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,039
the actual

228
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,479
limitation within yourself

229
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
i was also a slave to food you know

230
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
we've grown up in a society where we say

231
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
have breakfast is the most important

232
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,360
meal of the day

233
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,120
so we have breakfast lunch and dinner

234
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,039
when you look in nature this is not the

235
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,879
case for the average

236
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,599
mammal out there they do not feed on a

237
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,560
daily basis

238
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
a lot of times they may go hungry for

239
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,599
days if not weeks

240
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,440
so i wanted to also break this chain

241
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
from myself that i realized i have lived

242
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,560
at that time

243
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
close to 30 years and have never taken

244
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,360
one day off from eating

245
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,520
so i was a slave to consumption i was a

246
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,120
slave to eating to

247
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,759
food to these urges that resided within

248
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,560
me and to

249
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,680
break these chains i decided to do fast

250
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,599
a period of fasting which

251
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
lasted seven days this allowed me to

252
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,440
break that chain again

253
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,160
and i was emancipated from that knee to

254
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,199
continuously feed

255
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,319
again we get told stories you know we

256
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,240
get told stories that as a vegan you may

257
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
get sick that you may be weak

258
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,919
that you may not be able to do certain

259
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,000
things that these things exist within

260
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,320
you

261
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,159
i'm not pushing an idea here i'm merely

262
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,080
saying things that exist as stories and

263
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,039
narratives

264
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,200
to break these narratives i decided to

265
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,799
as a vegan

266
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,760
that lived twice my way again as i went

267
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
forward and i broke these chains that

268
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,560
existed

269
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,279
i was able to emancipate myself and to

270
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,320
learn who i

271
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
truly am beyond the narratives that were

272
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,480
given to me

273
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,920
that i did not choose so we live in an

274
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,880
inverted world

275
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
what do we mean by inverted inversion

276
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,880
exists in many different aspects of our

277
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,839
life

278
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,640
and if you take a quick look at various

279
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,680
industries

280
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,880
and various uh organizations this seems

281
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,000
to be the case

282
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,279
so as a designer as an engineer uh

283
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,600
you know we can remove conspiracy okay

284
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,279
we can put that to the side let's just

285
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,480
look at it from an engineering

286
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,839
perspective

287
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,920
there are huge design flaws within

288
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,680
you know numerous and very important

289
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,720
industries in our world so for example

290
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
school which is supposed to

291
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
liberate the mind and allow the

292
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
individual

293
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,600
to learn and to expand on their

294
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,720
curiosity

295
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,519
kills curiosity and engages the mind so

296
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,560
that the individual

297
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,120
is restricted to a form of curriculum

298
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
that is handed by the education system

299
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
it does not add to curiosity it limits

300
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,680
curiosity

301
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,480
and so that's from school news which is

302
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,519
supposed to inform

303
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,279
people so that they can live a better

304
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,640
life so that they can make better

305
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,600
decisions

306
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,040
actually ends up misinforming people so

307
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
they make worse decisions

308
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,279
it brainwashes people and these are all

309
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,040
issues that we can see across

310
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,920
various industries so medicine medicine

311
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,880
is supposed to heal

312
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,079
individuals so if you look at the

313
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,920
ancients and the

314
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,839
you know i went to mexico and they are

315
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,279
huge international

316
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,200
medicine and when you compare that to

317
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,800
our for our current existing

318
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
modern approach to medicine i mean the

319
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,079
world is so

320
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,720
it's completely inverted one heals one

321
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,120
uses nature one uses pharmaceuticals and

322
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,279
chemicals with huge side effects

323
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,279
that in most cases the side effects

324
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,920
catch up you know when you're much older

325
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,200
so again it's inverted

326
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
the very thing that you're taking to

327
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
heal you or help you will cause

328
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,279
more damage in the long run and then you

329
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,240
look at food

330
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,320
most food leaves a person malnourished

331
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,279
they end up sick

332
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,279
ill or causes a lot of issues the

333
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,279
inversion exists across so many

334
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,240
industries

335
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
i mean once you figure this out and you

336
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,160
understand it it's mind-boggling

337
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,079
for me it's absolutely mind-boggling

338
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,320
again social media was introduced to

339
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,800
connect

340
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,880
people right and you just you know this

341
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
is not my opinion you can look at a lot

342
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,279
of these

343
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,760
uh actual facts online and get the

344
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,720
statistics

345
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
that it's actually caused depression

346
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,399
it's caused as so many

347
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,240
people to feel even more lonely and

348
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,519
disconnected from

349
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,519
themselves and other individuals around

350
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,519
them it's destroyed the relationships

351
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,040
rather than create them

352
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,519
sure it's not black and white though a

353
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,920
huge portion of it has caused that

354
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,399
and these are things that i refer to as

355
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,200
inversions

356
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,399
things within our society that we're

357
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,279
at one stage perhaps doing good though

358
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,560
at this stage

359
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,800
and at this time in life they are

360
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
causing uh terrible

361
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
things so you can look at it as police

362
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
for example police is meant to make you

363
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,560
feel

364
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,839
safe guarded secure though they do not

365
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,399
make me

366
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
at any time feel guarded secure

367
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,760
perhaps it's different countries is you

368
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,600
know it's it's approached differently so

369
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,959
in the netherlands sure

370
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,200
i enjoyed actually the presence of place

371
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,000
because they were never

372
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,560
out to rob their own egos in australia

373
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,079
it's completely different

374
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,480
i mean mexico is completely different so

375
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,920
these inversions exist

376
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,240
in a lot of different countries though i

377
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,959
must

378
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,880
actually add that it's not always the

379
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,399
case but they do exist

380
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,399
so before i could actually go out and

381
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,240
speak about these things i wanted to

382
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,639
learn

383
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,560
what it is that i need to change so the

384
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,079
emancipation of myself

385
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,720
my body my mind my health my digital

386
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,560
existence and my interaction with the

387
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
world around me needed to be changed

388
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,040
needed to be altered so before i could

389
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,600
talk

390
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,160
i needed to actually learn and apply it

391
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
to my own life

392
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,600
so it's not so much the case of hey we

393
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
should be doing this because talk is

394
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,760
[ __ ]

395
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,920
the average person loves to talk about

396
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,800
various things

397
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,399
but how much of that are we actually

398
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,240
applying to our life which makes

399
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,079
huge difference knowledge without

400
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,600
application is useless

401
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,240
you know i hear so many people that say

402
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,200
oh i read

403
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,959
three books a week you're much better

404
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,480
off reading one book

405
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,399
continuously for one year until you

406
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,480
actually apply the knowledge that you've

407
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,200
gathered

408
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
there's no there's no race to gaining

409
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,120
knowledge so you can just say

410
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,639
you know speak at a meeting just so

411
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,839
you know you can feel good about

412
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,920
something the application is what's

413
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,519
important and that's what i really care

414
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,760
about

415
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,360
so coming back has been very interesting

416
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,079
i've spent about seven or eight years

417
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,600
previously returning to australia in

418
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,199
april this year

419
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,720
across three different continents

420
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
various countries

421
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,880
and you know being in mexico was one of

422
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,440
the most

423
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
eye-opening experiences of my life

424
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,480
honestly

425
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,920
because it's a place that the average

426
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
person would fear to go to right again

427
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,279
the inversion

428
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,600
that why it's a place where the cartels

429
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
are on i can tell you now

430
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,040
after everywhere i've lived and

431
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
everywhere i've been i have never lived

432
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
in a country where i have felt the

433
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,399
presence of love respect

434
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,519
community brotherhood and the

435
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,360
level of connection that people have

436
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,560
with one another

437
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,079
to that degree that i have felt in

438
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,959
mexico it's just it it just completely

439
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,600
again emancipated me and cleaned me off

440
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,399
these

441
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,639
residues that were you know left over

442
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,079
from various

443
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,399
models or narratives that exist in

444
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,880
various countries or cultures

445
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,959
so for me it was interesting to go there

446
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,199
and see that after having returned from

447
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,160
a place where

448
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,320
more than 50 of the country operates on

449
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,079
cash which is mexico

450
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,760
and a place where i really really felt

451
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,959
in touch with human beings

452
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,720
people were real i don't know how else

453
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,480
to put it to you but people were truly

454
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,279
real

455
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,519
and uh they were there for each other

456
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,959
sure it wasn't the prettiest place

457
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,800
things were falling apart systems were

458
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,920
outdated

459
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,160
and a lot of things you know you would

460
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,440
look at and be like well we could

461
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,120
improve the efficiency here or the

462
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
systems that are being used

463
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,120
so take that aside and let's look at the

464
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,440
humanity the humanity that existed there

465
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,000
for me

466
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,920
personally was on a level that i had

467
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,600
never seen across any of the countries

468
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,720
that i had visited

469
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
the closest that had come to it was

470
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,399
perhaps eastern europe

471
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,519
and during my travels through serbia and

472
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,560
macedonia so it's

473
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,399
interesting this inversion that exists

474
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
even with our narratives that we believe

475
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,000
that we are in a lucky country

476
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,839
in comparison so the average australian

477
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,440
truly believes that they are in a lucky

478
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,000
country

479
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,600
so they believe they are in the best

480
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,120
place in the world

481
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,600
so after you get out you know this may

482
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,120
be the narrative with people from united

483
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,240
states too

484
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,639
i don't mean any offense this is just my

485
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,720
observation and from what i've heard and

486
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
seen from people but once you travel a

487
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,199
bit and once you see how different

488
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,360
cultures exist and how different

489
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,199
countries provide things that you may

490
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,880
not have seen or

491
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,959
felt in your own place you start to

492
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,199
reshape that mind the emancipation of

493
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:57,839
thought

494
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,639
and perhaps uh this has an effect on

495
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,320
other areas of your life

496
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
so having returned from a place that i

497
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,839
truly felt free mexico

498
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,199
and you know obviously there are issues

499
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,480
in the northern part i was in the

500
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,279
southern part of

501
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,920
which is oaxaca and uh chiapas which is

502
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,040
predominantly more

503
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,759
indigenous uh involves more indigenous

504
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,560
population

505
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,399
uh in comparison to the north which is a

506
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,560
lot more affected by the united states

507
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,240
culture and other issues that exist

508
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,079
so having returned from such a place to

509
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,279
australia i was

510
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,120
i was truly shocked by the number of

511
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,360
cameras and surveillance that exists

512
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,079
around me and you know in mexico i could

513
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,600
drive for 12 hours

514
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,639
i would maybe see a police but he was

515
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,120
never

516
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,000
or she was never on the corner trying to

517
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,920
catch me speeding or something like this

518
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
they were just going on about that day

519
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,040
um liberty exists on a different level

520
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,759
see they didn't exist there in a level

521
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,160
that

522
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,959
was you need to be kept guided otherwise

523
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,800
people are going to do bad things

524
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,959
it was people just genuinely looked out

525
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,079
for each other

526
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,160
so when the more rules you have the less

527
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,240
people look out for each other

528
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,720
um because you rely and depend on the

529
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,760
rules

530
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,039
and uh unfortunately laws are not

531
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,079
natural natural laws are very different

532
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,640
you know and when you live in a country

533
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,119
that has

534
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,760
a huge number of uh limitations when it

535
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,640
comes to

536
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,559
freedom due to bureaucracy or other

537
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,720
reasons you get to understand this so i

538
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,679
came back

539
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,039
we came back to a country where the

540
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,960
actual citizen feels though they are

541
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,840
free

542
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,360
feels as though they are in one of the

543
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,039
greatest places they could be

544
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,400
so this is what i refer to as proudly

545
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,039
ignorant

546
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,960
or rather it's a phrase from john

547
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
pillinger a great

548
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,440
uh journalist australian journalist

549
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,600
so this proud ignorance exists across

550
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,679
various

551
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,679
countries and it could be from various

552
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,679
industries so a lot of the stuff that i

553
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,280
said to you for example that

554
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,120
you know the slavery model can exist and

555
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
the inversion can exist

556
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,200
in education and in health a lot of

557
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
people may protect that and

558
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
not appreciate that comment so

559
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,799
we are trying to break away from that so

560
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,400
let's move forward

561
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,120
so when i returned i noticed a lot of

562
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,679
tools that are being implemented

563
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,880
due to the covert situation which for

564
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,160
its own reasons

565
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
uh happens to coincide with the

566
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,760
introduction of a

567
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
number of surveillance tools whether

568
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,679
it's drones whether it's

569
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,440
you know police enforcing laws that

570
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,160
otherwise would not have been possible

571
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,760
so i started seeing more and more of

572
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
this especially in victoria which is the

573
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,720
southern part of

574
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,160
southern south eastern part of

575
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,799
australia uh where melbourne is one of

576
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,200
the

577
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
largest cities larger cities of

578
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
australia

579
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,039
so they have drones to scan people faces

580
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,880
to make sure they're wearing masks

581
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,280
and you know i can't help by panda were

582
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,039
these tools

583
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,360
somehow ready to be used or where they

584
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,200
just developed particularly for this

585
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,160
occasion

586
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,400
if it happens to be the case it just

587
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,080
happens to be a great coincidence

588
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,600
and then i'm seeing more and more

589
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
introduction of tools that would you

590
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,480
know otherwise

591
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,559
never be allowed to be implemented such

592
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,480
as you know as i mentioned the drones of

593
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,960
scanning people's faces at the beaches

594
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,039
um cameras hidden within parks to make

595
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,640
sure people are respecting social

596
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,760
distancing

597
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,039
and then we have the introduction of

598
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,200
facial recognition so that the

599
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,320
average person can access tools provided

600
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,840
by the government whether it's starting

601
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,640
a business

602
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,520
voting or accessing medicare which is

603
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,679
the health provider of australia

604
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,720
and or accessing welfare which we refer

605
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,360
to as centrelink benefits

606
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,720
so when you look at this as a whole um

607
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,640
you may not understand it as a person

608
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
that lives in australia

609
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,120
right though

610
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
it's beyond that for me because i have

611
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,039
worked as a journalist and i've written

612
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,720
many articles and this is a topic that

613
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,880
i'm quite passionate about you know

614
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,240
uh which is privacy security uh

615
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,679
decentralization so i know for example

616
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,440
in india uh the most vulnerable people

617
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,120
were targeted when they introduced the

618
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
system that used biometrics to enlist

619
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,240
individuals

620
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,520
onto a government-based system 1.1

621
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,919
out of the 1.3 billion people in the

622
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:18,840
country

623
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,200
uh were enrolled into this new

624
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,320
biometrics based

625
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
system unfortunately a lot of them

626
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,080
didn't even realize why they had to do

627
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,360
it they were just scared they may not

628
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,280
get their welfare their you know social

629
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,320
benefits

630
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,640
so in australia the similar a similar

631
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
tactic is being used because a lot of

632
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,760
these systems that i said

633
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,240
affects those who rely on the government

634
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
or the state

635
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,039
so sure you can look at it as like we

636
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,799
should break away from that

637
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,000
so it affects a very vulnerable

638
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,640
group of people so it makes me worried

639
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,720
it makes me worry to see these things

640
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
because people may not have a point of

641
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,559
comparison to see how it has affected

642
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,000
other countries

643
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,320
but nevertheless i am here and i'm

644
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
witnessing

645
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,640
a dystopian future being implemented if

646
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,919
you have been to

647
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,679
paralympic place you would have seen

648
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,120
this and

649
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,720
you would have been you would have heard

650
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,400
about uh how such

651
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,480
tools are being introduced and perhaps

652
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,679
you would have been educated

653
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,600
on how to protect yourself and we are

654
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,360
the lucky ones because we have that

655
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,880
ability to do so

656
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,720
you know as an individual i know how to

657
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,799
protect my system how to protect my

658
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,360
phone

659
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,520
how to protect my digital realm as i

660
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,039
said i've spent many years

661
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,400
protecting other parts of my individual

662
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,159
representation which is my health my

663
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,960
mind whatever my existence represents

664
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,039
uh and to break away from that but the

665
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,880
average person doesn't have that

666
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
knowledge the average person does not

667
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,520
know how to

668
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,080
do anything different and unfortunately

669
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,240
in many ways our world is decided by the

670
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,120
average person

671
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,520
it's not decided by me or you or people

672
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,200
that may have a better understanding on

673
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,080
the implement

674
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,280
of the impact that these sort of tools

675
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,039
may have on our lives

676
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,360
so another part of it is the

677
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,400
i wanted to show you is the kind of

678
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,080
breaking away from liberties that we

679
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,120
have um on the basis of justifying it

680
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,760
for example in the current situation on

681
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,880
the war against

682
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
uh cove um so these wars have existed

683
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,120
for a long time sure after 9 11 we saw

684
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,039
how many liberties were taken away

685
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,840
on the premise that it's for our own

686
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,559
good

687
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,640
uh the surveillance states that have

688
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
expanded through the cia nsa

689
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
and you know globally and many other

690
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,400
countries such as the five eyes

691
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,360
um which includes australia new zealand

692
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,600
we have seen the justifications that it

693
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,440
is always for your own good when doing

694
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,400
this for you

695
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,640
and these narratives obviously if you're

696
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,919
well informed

697
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,880
um you understand that it's not based on

698
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,000
a very strong

699
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,240
uh premise uh it's not the reality

700
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,559
so the average person believes that to

701
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,600
be the reality

702
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
you know and that's unfortunately the

703
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,520
case

704
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
so this is a great book by the way by

705
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,840
nassim

706
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,880
um and i loved reading it and one of the

707
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,559
most powerful things that i took from it

708
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,200
is that

709
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,799
you know be nice to everyone but if

710
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,880
someone exercises power over you

711
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,039
exercise power over them so sure you

712
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,240
want to enforce these sort of

713
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,280
surveillance states

714
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
no problem i'm gonna up my operating

715
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,039
system my security devices

716
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,679
everything else around me so as i said

717
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,679
we are in a good situation but how do we

718
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,679
get other people involved how do we get

719
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,280
other people to break away from the

720
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,080
slavery

721
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
and to see the inversion that exists in

722
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
our world

723
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,320
so i sat and pondered on how this

724
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,840
affects different industries right

725
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
when you look at for example from again

726
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,320
from an engineering perspective from a

727
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,000
design perspective

728
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,400
most systems are built in an upside down

729
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
model so upside down what does that mean

730
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
so in 2008 for example after the global

731
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,720
financial crisis

732
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,880
who carried the burden it was the people

733
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,000
the taxpayers

734
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,480
who continuously carries the burden for

735
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,000
the mistakes of those on

736
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,360
the top of the model again

737
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,159
it's the people and there's a systematic

738
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,159
risk being introduced to the people that

739
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,919
doesn't need to be introduced so again

740
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,039
let's rip away

741
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,600
any notion of conspiracy that could be

742
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,720
labeled as such

743
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,559
as let's look at it from an engineering

744
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,640
perspective why would you have designed

745
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,919
the system

746
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,120
that would introduce systematic risk and

747
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,039
place it on the very people that it's

748
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,960
supposed to protect

749
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,279
so the banking system is supposed to

750
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,080
alleviate

751
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,200
those who are in financial turmoil

752
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,919
though it places the risk on those very

753
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,960
individuals

754
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,640
and you can get this same model and

755
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,400
apply it across various

756
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,080
across various industries you know the

757
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
pharmaceutical industry their risk is

758
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,760
carried to the individuals who take the

759
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,200
medicine

760
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
you can look at it as universities

761
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,440
whether the course becomes obsolete or

762
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,840
the knowledge is no longer required

763
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
it leads you to panda who is left with

764
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,960
the debt

765
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,559
that they may not be able to get a job

766
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,799
with or may not have the freedom because

767
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,840
they have the debt

768
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,320
to explore things that they are curious

769
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,159
about so if you're a lawyer and you have

770
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,200
finished

771
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,679
you no longer have the freedom to go and

772
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,760
work for an ngo

773
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,679
you have to pay off your debt so

774
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,679
naturally you're going to

775
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
be more driven to go and work for a high

776
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,480
paying role if you're a programmer if

777
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:26,799
you

778
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,279
you know various jobs i noticed and

779
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,400
various industries

780
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,799
unnoticed shackle people through this

781
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,880
systematic uh

782
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,159
system design and the floor that it has

783
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:38,640
in it

784
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,080
you know from engineering perspective

785
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,679
it's absolutely garbage

786
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,480
it's like it's like designing a car okay

787
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,240
and if there was a car accident

788
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,679
the passengers take the take the uh

789
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,760
blow from the accident i mean that would

790
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
be terrible right as an engineer

791
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,600
if i designed a car that i said if it

792
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,880
gets into an accident

793
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,559
the people inside the car will take the

794
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,480
hit it would be terrible

795
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,720
no one would buy the car so a lot of

796
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,240
industries around us

797
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,360
are designed so that we as individuals

798
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,840
take the blow for the mistakes of a very

799
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,360
few individuals

800
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,679
so let's look at it from engineering can

801
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,360
we design things better

802
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,159
can we emancipate people from a place

803
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,760
where they don't have choice how do we

804
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,279
alleviate these

805
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,279
particular issues

806
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,039
i love this quote because this quote

807
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,960
really gives me hope when i'm

808
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,559
you know at times scratching my head

809
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,320
going what's going on in the world

810
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,159
can we have an impact can we do

811
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,840
something to make a

812
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,400
difference of course we can if you look

813
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,880
at

814
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,480
uh you know various events throughout

815
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,919
history it's the very

816
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,919
minor number of people have made the

817
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,400
difference look at parolini police for

818
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,440
example

819
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,840
how many people come there in comparison

820
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,679
to the number of people that have never

821
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,400
heard of

822
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
a lot of the talks and conversations

823
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,520
that take place

824
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,320
but yet these individuals are are the

825
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,159
ones that are making the impact

826
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,720
and having an impact i myself have been

827
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
emancipated in many different ways by

828
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,440
just simply

829
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,360
attending the hackers congress or being

830
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,720
to parallel any police and

831
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,960
speaking too few individuals and then

832
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,760
you can

833
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,159
you know kind of multiply that across

834
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:14,799
various

835
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,120
uh fields and various things that have

836
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,880
occurred on a global scale

837
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,559
so of course we can have an impact of

838
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,159
course we can make a difference

839
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,600
and that is the inversion that once

840
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,000
again exists in our world where

841
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,080
the individual cannot do something we

842
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
need to go within the system and

843
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,080
get the government to change things or

844
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,760
we need to go through the u.n and get

845
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,600
the u.n to change things absolute

846
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,320
garbage

847
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,480
all of these absolute garbage these are

848
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,600
narratives that exist

849
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,399
on fallacy uh they do not represent

850
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,919
reality because in

851
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,159
in actual fact you can't change those

852
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,039
systems

853
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,880
you have to create new things you have

854
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,720
to go about your day and ponder how do

855
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,279
you

856
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,840
solve problems that exist in your world

857
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,520
and to do so you really need to

858
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,960
emancipate the self

859
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,279
so once you feel free you no longer have

860
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,960
that blockage of can i

861
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,279
and what else you you sit down and go

862
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,679
what what how do i apply this

863
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,080
you know so it brings me back

864
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,159
and the inversion again exists within

865
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,279
bitcoin and it's

866
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,399
uh you know system architecture

867
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,399
which referred to as a blockchain a

868
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,240
blockchain is what a lot of people

869
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,399
focus on right so you go to a lot of

870
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,159
let's say corporate events and

871
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,080
it's become more mainstream it's almost

872
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
uh you know in everyone's

873
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,880
kind of mind now that how do we use a

874
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,640
blockchain well they refer to it as the

875
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,080
blockchain but we all know that's

876
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,200
ridiculous

877
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
uh how do we use these systems

878
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,360
no one focuses on bitcoin bitcoin is

879
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,000
this

880
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,720
first truly decentralized money in human

881
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,600
history

882
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
did we forget about that but yet we see

883
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,120
the inversion again

884
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,279
the focus went on blockchain not this

885
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,600
decentralized money that breaks away

886
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,880
people's uh you know need to rely on the

887
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,679
system

888
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,440
on a financial system that is heavily

889
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,360
corrupted and it has an engineering

890
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,159
problem that

891
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,000
puts the burden on the people we've seen

892
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,679
many examples of this

893
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,360
the control of money dictates if you can

894
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,440
go to war the control of money dictates

895
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,399
if you can

896
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,720
use violence against someone you know

897
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
and a lot of these things exist the the

898
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,159
narrative was changed

899
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,480
and we went from bitcoin being a truly

900
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,440
powerful

901
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,399
uh invention one of the most important

902
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,840
in our recent history

903
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,520
that allowed for accessibility

904
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,919
efficiency and you can see a number of

905
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:28,399
different

906
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,279
uh benefits of bitcoin but the narrative

907
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,039
was changed and it was altered so we

908
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,760
focus on

909
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,919
blockchain so you'll even hear people be

910
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,520
like bitcoin is irrelevant

911
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,840
it's blockchain that's that we need to

912
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,640
focus on that's the true powerhouse

913
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,399
but that is not the case and i'm sure

914
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,320
many of you attending this event

915
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,240
whether watching online or in person or

916
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,360
at any time

917
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,200
well you know it doesn't it doesn't take

918
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,520
much time to come to realize that

919
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,080
the sovereignty the inclusivity the word

920
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,440
things are changing you know the

921
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,520
narrative was changed to focus to get

922
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,679
people to focus on blockchain

923
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,679
and as i said our rules in our world is

924
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,120
dictated by the average

925
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,440
not by the you know minority who may

926
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,640
know the truth

927
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,799
and the average person has looked at

928
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,080
bitcoin as this very

929
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,440
volatile tool that's used for you know

930
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,679
so many negative narratives that has

931
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,520
been created around it

932
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
even though we know in reality that is

933
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,440
the financial systems that loan the

934
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,919
money

935
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,440
for across you know number of uh

936
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,039
one doing organizations and

937
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,840
companies so the narrative was changed

938
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,080
to blockchain and then it was taken

939
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
public blockchain and we no longer focus

940
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,159
on public and now we focus on private

941
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:40,960
blockchains

942
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,440
which is what this new narrative is that

943
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,480
the federal reserve is going to

944
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
introduce its own

945
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,399
and we see so many other examples of

946
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,559
currencies that are privately

947
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,880
uh managed and this is not what bitcoin

948
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,240
was about none of those

949
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,320
things that got people excited exist in

950
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,640
this private world

951
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,919
though that is the case

952
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,120
now you have heard my story you have

953
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,399
heard how

954
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,559
i thrive to emancipate myself from the

955
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,320
so many limitations that exist so that

956
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,279
my mind can

957
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,840
imagine a world uh void of such

958
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,919
limitations and slavery that exists

959
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,760
within each and every single one of us

960
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,399
across

961
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,879
various

962
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,200
components in that life so i sat down

963
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,799
and thought about the education part

964
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,799
i sat down and thought about why is it

965
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,240
that after

966
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
seven years you know so many countries

967
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,360
so many people people

968
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,200
still have no idea what bitcoin is and

969
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,360
why did this focus shift the way to

970
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,960
blockchain-based systems

971
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,720
what happened to bitcoin why didn't

972
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,840
people use it why is the narrative so

973
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,000
negative

974
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,080
so i sat down and figured kind of these

975
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,440
things out in my own time

976
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,320
and i wanted to undo the inversion on

977
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
education i wanted to give it back to

978
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,559
the people the same way bitcoin took

979
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,320
money from the financial systems and

980
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,000
governments and gave it back to the

981
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,440
people so they may manage it uh i wanted

982
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,120
to do the same with education so that

983
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,720
the curriculum and knowledge is held by

984
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
the people not by the industry

985
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,559
not by the money that dictates what

986
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,159
people should be studying and what is

987
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,840
favorable and what is not

988
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,960
and this brings me to the initiation

989
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,519
of big tokyo university a decentralized

990
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,320
university

991
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,880
that has not ever existed before sure we

992
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,799
have online universities that people

993
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,399
think but a lot of these courses are

994
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,279
obsolete i'm not

995
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,519
interested in reinventing the wheel i'm

996
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,519
not interested in hosting courses that

997
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,440
already exist in universities that

998
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,679
are highly craft anyways i'm interested

999
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,200
in the knowledge that the average person

1000
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,080
cannot

1001
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,480
gain from whether it's open university

1002
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,919
or your typical

1003
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,640
uh government or university or otherwise

1004
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,080
private universities

1005
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,440
i'm interested in the knowledge that

1006
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
emancipates itself like the things that

1007
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,960
i went and learned about

1008
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,200
and how to heal yourself and how to

1009
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,880
create things within your life how to

1010
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,399
empower the individual

1011
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,000
i'm interested in this sort of knowledge

1012
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
that you cannot gain

1013
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,559
so i sat down and thought about how i

1014
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,919
can alter

1015
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,480
education and allow people to come in

1016
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,159
and use it so i took the model from

1017
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,159
bitcoin i replaced the bitcoin miners

1018
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,600
with students

1019
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,480
and the validation of those blocks are

1020
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,919
replaced by oracles

1021
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,120
and what if we have a course instead of

1022
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,000
having a course that

1023
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
let's say what's your gpa or what did

1024
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,519
you what mark did you get

1025
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,279
what do you what about that we have

1026
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,200
certain criteria that we achieve so what

1027
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
does it mean to be a black belt for

1028
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,240
example

1029
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,679
in a course that is about uh bitcoin

1030
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,440
black belt perhaps means that you can

1031
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,200
fork the chain then you can

1032
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,120
create your own wallet and compile it

1033
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,240
that you can

1034
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,960
program and uh you can do many different

1035
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,399
things that you can sit down and think

1036
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,279
about

1037
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,440
and these would be adjustable depending

1038
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,039
on who's attending and who's doing

1039
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,360
things

1040
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,880
so as i mentioned at the start um i did

1041
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,799
i did a few workshops because i wanted

1042
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,480
to see if this concept

1043
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,760
is valid and if what i have designed can

1044
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,799
be

1045
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,359
constructed and it's required out there

1046
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,040
so i held a workshop in the city of san

1047
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,239
cristobal

1048
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,918
in the southern part of mexico in

1049
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,679
chapels and there

1050
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,159
i asked the people who attended to fill

1051
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,199
out a questionnaire

1052
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,839
which included uh why haven't you used

1053
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:22,879
bitcoin

1054
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,719
uh what is the normal narrative that you

1055
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,480
hear about it uh

1056
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,320
how do you feel towards it how does the

1057
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,960
technology in your view impact society

1058
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,359
ask various questions right and i did an

1059
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,079
analysis

1060
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,119
on the the words and the sentencing that

1061
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,560
people have used you know i

1062
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,639
gathered about 20 different booklets and

1063
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,960
i processed all the words that existed

1064
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,560
and the limitations as to why they

1065
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,159
haven't used bitcoin because for me it

1066
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,359
was very interesting

1067
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,159
to find out why they haven't used it so

1068
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,960
as you can see

1069
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,239
knowledge was the main reason that

1070
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,599
people had not used it

1071
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,680
like many things in life i'm sure

1072
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,440
individuals out there want to know how

1073
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,560
to eat better

1074
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,520
what foods that allows them to heal

1075
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,200
themselves

1076
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,320
what what sort of places they would

1077
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,240
for example learn more from what

1078
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,720
cultures they would resonate with

1079
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,720
and in this case i will show the

1080
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,400
individuals if they knew the truth about

1081
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,560
bitcoin and the impact that it has

1082
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,960
they would be more involved with it so

1083
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,920
knowledge

1084
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,320
seems to be the limitation in our world

1085
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,680
and how we interact

1086
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,000
and free ourselves and the lack of

1087
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,680
knowledge and the lack of time for

1088
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,280
people to gain that knowledge

1089
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,359
seems to be the issue because if you've

1090
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,480
gone through university and you've

1091
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,839
accumulated that there

1092
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,359
and you've gone through other things in

1093
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,359
life that have shackled you in various

1094
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,000
parts

1095
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,040
you're not gonna have the uh

1096
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,160
mentality or the time uh you can

1097
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,079
obviously make time right we can all

1098
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,160
make time but the average person again

1099
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,240
uh does not believe they have the time

1100
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,599
so if we gave them the knowledge to

1101
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,200
realize they have the time and they have

1102
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,480
the knowledge to

1103
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
emancipate themselves from the form of

1104
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,240
slavery in many different parts of their

1105
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,839
life now that's digital

1106
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,720
we can start to move forward so i

1107
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,320
recently did a talk with someone

1108
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,560
and in this talk i said look we can put

1109
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,480
bill gates and steve jobs aside

1110
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,880
what if we have a stand and we give

1111
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,720
people the knowledge in a digital form

1112
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,000
so give me your laptop

1113
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,920
let's sit down and think about why you

1114
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
use microsoft windows if you need it for

1115
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,320
work

1116
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,720
sure that's just for work other areas of

1117
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,599
your life can be

1118
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,839
altered right give me a laptop i'll put

1119
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,440
linux on it and you can go about your

1120
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,119
day we don't need to discuss

1121
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,000
other issues uh same can happen with

1122
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,520
your mobile phone

1123
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,359
and you can jailbreak you can do many

1124
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,119
different things put a vpn on someone's

1125
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,200
computer and show them how to use it how

1126
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,040
to pay for it using bitcoin

1127
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,599
and many different things that we can

1128
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,160
one by one introduce and give people a

1129
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,280
sort of key as to how they can free

1130
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,160
themselves through

1131
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,560
knowledge because knowledge is the most

1132
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,240
powerful thing with knowledge you can do

1133
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,960
anything

1134
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,680
sure um a lot of people like to focus on

1135
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,640
money and money

1136
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,720
sure helps in many different areas but

1137
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
with knowledge you can gain money too

1138
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,079
but with knowledge you can survive

1139
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,880
without food you can survive

1140
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,040
in extreme conditions it is the

1141
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,119
knowledge and the application

1142
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,119
of that knowledge that makes a

1143
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,599
difference

1144
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,000
so utopia is a decentralized autonomous

1145
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,320
university it exists on aragon as a

1146
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,480
decentralized autonomous organization

1147
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,839
if you want to contribute if you want to

1148
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,520
collaborate i would love to hear from

1149
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,640
you you can find the

1150
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,960
link at bittopia.org we have a telegram

1151
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,720
channel and various other channels that

1152
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,079
you can reach out on

1153
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,680
and i'm trying to build something

1154
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,280
revolutionary here i'm not trying to

1155
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,480
really win the wheel

1156
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,040
i want this to be a unification of

1157
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,680
various

1158
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,119
decentralized applications and

1159
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,720
technologies that exist

1160
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,400
i have done my proof of concept in the

1161
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,520
physical it has worked people love it

1162
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,240
and i see the limitations for example so

1163
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,680
many events and workshops

1164
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,160
attract a similar minded people it's an

1165
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,680
echo chamber that's bouncing

1166
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,000
back and forward i want this to be more

1167
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,440
than just blockchain knowledge i want

1168
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
this to be permaculture ecology and

1169
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,079
other things

1170
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,760
that emancipates the individual no

1171
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,440
matter where they are i want people to

1172
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,960
contribute to the curriculum

1173
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,720
which will be completely open source for

1174
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,480
anyone to contribute to you will be

1175
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,680
rewarded for it

1176
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,520
as a student you will be rewarded the

1177
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,119
top students will be rewarded

1178
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,839
on the tuition that comes in in a form

1179
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,880
of basic income

1180
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,480
why should a student have to go through

1181
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,400
university and

1182
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,640
accumulate debt why shouldn't a good

1183
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,560
student just like a powerful minor with

1184
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,839
a great hash power

1185
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,680
be rewarded for the work that they have

1186
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,680
done the proof of knowledge the proof of

1187
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,800
contribution

1188
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,160
so these are the elements that i have

1189
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,839
implemented and i don't

1190
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,680
see anything like this ever being done

1191
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,000
before so it is far beyond any online

1192
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,200
course online

1193
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,599
university it is it is a redesign and

1194
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,839
re-engineered model of education

1195
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,079
and giving access to people anywhere in

1196
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,280
the world

1197
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,079
i hope to do to the education industry

1198
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:54,560
uh

1199
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,240
what bitcoin did to the financial

1200
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,560
industry and emancipate the minds and

1201
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,320
bring knowledge out from the hidden

1202
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,680
corners of the world

1203
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,520
and have a decentralized library that

1204
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,960
people can access

1205
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,359
and lift up things that are otherwise

1206
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,000
hidden

1207
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,880
so we don't swing in an inverted world

1208
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,560
but rather a world that represents

1209
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,280
reality

1210
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
a world that represents true knowledge

1211
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
passed down through generations

1212
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,599
rather than a few individuals who

1213
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,200
dictate it based on

1214
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,640
their financial or political incentives

1215
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,720
thank you very much for listening to my

1216
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,280
conversation uh again i would have loved

1217
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,560
to have been there it is completely

1218
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,280
different

1219
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,480
speaking to camera in australia at 9 43

1220
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,359
p.m

1221
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,280
uh than actually being there in presence

1222
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,960
i love paralynic police and everything

1223
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,079
it represents

1224
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,640
and i hope to return there in the years

1225
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
that comes

1226
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,000
and thank you for listening to me i hope

1227
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,440
you learned something and i hope you

1228
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,200
understand as an individual

1229
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,599
and that you know slavery affects many

1230
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,200
different parts of our life and it's up

1231
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,359
to you it is always up to you as the

1232
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,640
individual to figure out

1233
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,680
what is limiting you uh to reach a

1234
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,000
southern state whether it's digitally

1235
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,920
through different open source and secure

1236
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,000
software or

1237
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,599
you know other parts of your life

1238
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,599
physically relationships health and

1239
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,560
everything else

1240
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
so that you may get a better

1241
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,920
understanding of who you are and how to

1242
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,800
apply it

1243
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:25,440
thank you cheers

1244
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,720
uh thank you very much as well i mean uh

1245
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,280
by now there is not any question in the

1246
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,119
hopping app but

1247
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,720
all those listeners uh uh on internet

1248
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,079
can still use it

1249
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,480
but we have one question here in

1250
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,440
institute

1251
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,560
so uh do we have portable mic

1252
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,839
or no please come

1253
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,839
so amen can see you

1254
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
um so

1255
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,640
chuck can you hear me okay um

1256
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,920
towards the beginning you mentioned

1257
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,400
something um

1258
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,920
kind of interesting i'm wondering if i

1259
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,800
understood it right um

1260
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,000
because it sounds like what you were

1261
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,599
describing with this sort of creeping

1262
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,079
totalitarianism in

1263
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,440
australia versus mexico

1264
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,560
was a system where

1265
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,160
one government bureaucrat decides that

1266
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,319
you know we can use surveillance for

1267
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,079
this application

1268
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,160
and so he or she pushes it through

1269
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,359
and there's not really any organized

1270
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,280
conspiracy to

1271
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,359
create this whole outcome it just sort

1272
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,880
of evolves

1273
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,920
and i'm wondering if it would be

1274
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,160
accurate in your view to describe this

1275
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,440
mechanism

1276
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,599
as someone who's sort of trapped in the

1277
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,040
system seeing a way

1278
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,440
to expand their personal power and

1279
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,400
ability

1280
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,839
within the framework of the system as a

1281
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,400
whole

1282
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,800
by increasing some level of surveillance

1283
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,839
and control because

1284
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,280
now they have control over some group of

1285
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,880
people they have more data about some

1286
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,880
group of people

1287
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,160
which in turn increases the power and

1288
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,720
control

1289
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,960
of the system over everybody which

1290
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,160
net reduces the power and ability of any

1291
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,960
one person

1292
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,359
in the system which in turn inspires

1293
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,400
more people

1294
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,440
to try to increase their own uh

1295
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,400
power by subjugating others which sort

1296
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,160
of continues this vicious cycle

1297
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,079
of the system getting ever ever more

1298
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,520
powerful and people trying to

1299
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,720
carve out their own little fiefdoms uh

1300
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,040
or

1301
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,319
niches um by measures that end up making

1302
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,240
the problem worse

1303
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,280
does that make sense okay sure so i

1304
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,000
guess the

1305
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
the uh the perspective that you're

1306
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,960
depicting here would

1307
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,640
entail that they are merely opportunists

1308
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,720
that they have seen this occasion rise

1309
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,880
um they being the government or whoever

1310
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,200
the organization is a part of the

1311
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,280
implementation of such surveillance

1312
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,839
systems and tools

1313
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,920
and they have gone for it while

1314
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,920
a person is on their knees for example

1315
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,319
is that is am i understanding it correct

1316
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,359
yeah and that the driver is almost more

1317
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,079
the powerlessness that the existing

1318
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:24,880
system

1319
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,040
imposes on the people who are part of it

1320
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,000
because if you're a government

1321
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,880
bureaucrat

1322
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,520
you know what's your biggest uh goal in

1323
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,880
life it's to advance

1324
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,480
and become a higher ranking government

1325
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
bureaucrat it's not a particularly

1326
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,240
fulfilling existence

1327
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,880
but if you can carve out some semblance

1328
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,640
or some feeling of having achieved

1329
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,359
something

1330
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,760
by putting out cameras or drones that

1331
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,920
cost people for not wearing masks

1332
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,440
uh at least you get the feeling of

1333
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,720
having escaped the thing that's

1334
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,800
repressing and depressing you if only

1335
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,079
for a few minutes

1336
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,480
but that in turn by repressing and

1337
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,000
depressing other people

1338
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,560
inspires others to take similar measures

1339
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
to achieve a similar outcome

1340
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,680
it's like a vicious cycle yeah um

1341
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,520
like i can entertain that though

1342
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,599
i would have to be and i don't mean

1343
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,200
anything bad but i would have to be

1344
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,640
naive to believe that

1345
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
they are so oblivious to it that this

1346
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,640
all just happened by coincidence that so

1347
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,160
many tools that

1348
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,000
that just popped out you know i would

1349
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,960
have to be naive to assume that

1350
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,280
there wasn't some sort of a design tool

1351
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,880
some predetermined

1352
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,160
outcome a path to this that

1353
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,839
where did these drones are suddenly come

1354
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,280
where did the software suddenly get

1355
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,480
implemented on it

1356
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,040
where did the you know the uh the

1357
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,720
procedures come into it

1358
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,319
but it was almost as though it was all

1359
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,720
waiting to happen so i can entertain

1360
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,240
what you're saying in the point that you

1361
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,920
know as an individual if you were doing

1362
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,960
that

1363
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,960
but i can't i can't do that because

1364
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,240
i know there's more to the story well i

1365
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,040
think one

1366
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
one way to explain this i mean i'm not

1367
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,200
saying there's no grand conspiracy

1368
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,640
um i'm just saying we don't really have

1369
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,040
a lot of evidence uh for a grand

1370
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,240
conspiracy

1371
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,079
because if there is such evidence it's

1372
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,160
classified top secret

1373
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,640
um i think there's a big trial in

1374
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,680
england right now

1375
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,520
uh of a certain uh white-haired

1376
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,200
publisher uh

1377
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,800
who's potentially being sent to his

1378
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,880
death for exposing parts of what might

1379
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,319
be a conspiracy

1380
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,960
um but if you from a theoretical

1381
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,400
perspective if we try to explain it

1382
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,800
without recourse to conspiracy

1383
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,280
you could look at cybernetics which came

1384
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,240
around in the

1385
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,280
late 40s and early 50s as an academic

1386
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,240
theory

1387
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,560
uh which posited that the solution more

1388
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,160
more or less that i can summarize

1389
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,720
that the solution to any problem that a

1390
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,920
politician or

1391
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,720
government official might have is more

1392
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,560
surveillance and control

1393
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,319
and it provides a very concrete almost

1394
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,839
mathematical step by which

1395
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,440
you can solve nearly any problem of

1396
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,839
government or corporate management

1397
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,200
by more surveillance and control

1398
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,200
in an uninspired mind that may be the

1399
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,000
case

1400
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,839
so i can give you two examples for

1401
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,200
example in the netherlands

1402
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,280
that is not the case if i was to compare

1403
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,480
the netherlands um

1404
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,520
in uh you know compared to the uk so in

1405
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,280
the uk when you walk around in specific

1406
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,280
london more than the uk

1407
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,560
there's signs everywhere that you're

1408
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,319
being watched do not steal and you

1409
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,680
constantly feel

1410
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,839
this pressure as though like am i doing

1411
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,280
something wrong why am i being watched

1412
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,200
am i a criminal like what's going on

1413
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,880
whereas in the netherlands uh if

1414
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,560
surveillance is done in a correct way

1415
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,480
the individual will never hear about it

1416
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,319
i truly never felt i was being watched

1417
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,119
in the netherlands

1418
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,640
at all and i'm not saying there aren't

1419
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,720
cameras there so that narrative that you

1420
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,000
depicted that

1421
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,160
they always feel that they will have

1422
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,440
better success with one with

1423
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,319
surveillance

1424
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,160
i think that is a very uninspired mind

1425
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,680
it would be similar to the parent that

1426
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,440
constantly watches their child in case

1427
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,480
something happens

1428
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,800
versus the you know the parents that

1429
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,480
allow their kids to have the freedom so

1430
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,920
that they can learn themselves while

1431
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,880
being there to

1432
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,280
help them feel secure at the same time

1433
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:05,920
um

1434
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,520
so i will have to bring that reasoning

1435
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,200
and justify that too

1436
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,119
well i think if you look at a lot of the

1437
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,560
people who make these decisions in

1438
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,359
government in this

1439
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,960
industry they certainly aren't very

1440
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,400
inspired people

1441
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,520
no no absolutely not i'll i definitely

1442
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,480
agree with you there

1443
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,079
it's because the individuals don't

1444
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,760
choose the rule to you know in most

1445
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,599
cases if you look at the police officer

1446
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,200
and let's say in australia

1447
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,319
i very doubt through my experience feel

1448
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,640
that those individuals that came became

1449
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,599
a police officer

1450
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,040
became a police officer because they

1451
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,720
wanted to make society more safe and

1452
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,440
secure

1453
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,200
in a lot of cases based on my

1454
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,800
interactions and understanding

1455
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,000
they became that because they have

1456
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,240
avoiding themselves that they needed to

1457
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,319
have some sort of a feel that they have

1458
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,520
power somewhere else

1459
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,440
and it is those very individuals that

1460
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,559
should not become police officers um

1461
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,079
you know and and then we can apply to

1462
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,160
this to various roles within society

1463
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,000
whether it's a politician that feels

1464
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
validated through their role even though

1465
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,599
they do very corrupted things

1466
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,240
versus the humanitarian who may never

1467
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,480
get to that level of access

1468
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,680
in comparison to the person who is very

1469
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,960
self-centered and

1470
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,680
self-serving

1471
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,119
thank you and just to add

1472
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,160
um i don't like the word conspiracy

1473
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,680
because conspiracy for me is used to uh

1474
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,760
to dismantle so many arguments

1475
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,280
especially these days

1476
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,720
um a conspiracy for me is the is is the

1477
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,040
financial is the federal reserve that's

1478
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,359
a conspiracy that no one can order it

1479
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,720
that for me is you know again the

1480
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,119
inversion occurs so much in reality once

1481
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:39,680
you start

1482
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,119
paying attention to this inversion

1483
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,880
across so many parts of life

1484
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,960
uh it blows your mind really like the

1485
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,400
federal reserve is a conspiracy the

1486
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,079
government of the us and the illusion of

1487
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:48,800
choice

1488
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,720
um and the power grab they have on so

1489
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,240
many countries is a conspiracy there's

1490
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,680
so many things that are in reality

1491
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,200
conspiracy but we don't refer to them in

1492
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,160
conspiracy

1493
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,920
and the reality has been referred to as

1494
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
conspiracy again the inversion exists

1495
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,040
there too

1496
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,000
i just wanted to add that to it thank

1497
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,359
you very much i mean

1498
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,400
uh nobody else is demanding

1499
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,800
uh the question but if you can ask very

1500
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,480
briefly

1501
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,599
uh sweet then we have to free for the

1502
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,000
other

1503
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,359
session so just a brief

1504
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,000
uh very brief i'm a content creator i

1505
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,680
actually create content for open source

1506
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,720
products

1507
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,200
what uh for bittopia what incentives do

1508
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,280
you have for content creators

1509
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,280
uh do you mean in terms of articles are

1510
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,800
actually content for education

1511
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,319
uh coming for education uh

1512
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,079
so it's it's a decentralized autonomous

1513
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,599
organization so if you want

1514
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,119
you know if you want to be incentivized

1515
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,040
for the uh for the work that you're

1516
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,760
doing

1517
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,000
uh we have our own uh token embedded

1518
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,040
within aragon

1519
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,839
and uh depending on what you're doing it

1520
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:54,319
gets

1521
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,000
it's all transparent through the system

1522
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,440
of uh i guess

1523
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,680
the dow system that aragon has so it

1524
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,960
would really depend on what you're doing

1525
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,319
we have that system

1526
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,480
um that we use our own token but the

1527
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,040
token is also backed uh by finances

1528
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,440
it hasn't kicked in yet though the idea

1529
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,880
is that you know a certain amount of

1530
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,480
tokens equal certain amount of dollars

1531
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,359
and they're into

1532
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,319
interchangeable so as the tuitions come

1533
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:16,880
in

1534
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,119
um tokens are purchased and burned

1535
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,720
depending on what happens so when a

1536
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720
student pays for a course those tokens

1537
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,640
are burnt and they're interchangeable

1538
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,640
with their dai which would represent

1539
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,960
one dollar which is the best way we can

1540
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,839
do it so

1541
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,480
you can get it in utopia's token and in

1542
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,599
time you'll be able to

1543
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,760
exchange it for dai and do whatever else

1544
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,280
you want with it so that's the incentive

1545
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,359
model

1546
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,319
thank you very much amen

1547
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,319
thank you everyone for listening and uh

1548
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:54,730
have a nice day good night guys

1549
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,150
