1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,480
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,200
so uh

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,760
yeah i think we're gonna start by um

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,599
giving a little bit of history

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,040
longer history than you think um over 20

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,160
years ago

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,960
uh was the first time i met harry and uh

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,840
it just so

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,960
i was trying to figure out the first

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
time i actually met him but i think what

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,359
it was is

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,800
i was in a band uh it was called atentot

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,359
and uh we played noise music and did

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,039
some like weird performance stuff and

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,800
like made little fires and things like

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,200
that

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,280
and he was in a band that sang only in

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,640
pirate talk

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,280
and uh we were play and uh like a punk

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,440
band that only the lyrics were like our

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,040
matey and like they only talked in

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,559
pirates and it was a benefit for the

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,920
zapdatistas

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
uh the whole event was a benefit for

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
zapdistas i think

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
and uh yeah so that was over 20 years

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,480
ago

28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,480
so then uh four what

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,559
uh in north carolina uh where there's

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,079
like you know and then uh we also hung

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,840
out like in the back woods where there's

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,800
like

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,280
weird cabins falling apart and you have

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,360
to watch out for meth labs and all this

35
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,320
kind of

36
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,200
and uh and then four years ago i was

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,080
here

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,520
and i hadn't seen harry in over 10 years

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,240
we like almost crossed paths a lot of

40
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,680
different times we both were really busy

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,960
with different stuff but i found him

42
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,520
here

43
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,680
and he wasn't really into he was doing

44
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
more some different stuff than bitcoin

45
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,280
and i was more into bitcoin i was just

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,880
doing mixnets actually just doing

47
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,759
mixnets

48
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,360
and uh he was like yeah i'm trying to

49
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
raise money for this crazy thing

50
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,040
i was like well why don't you think

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,400
about doing it with

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,920
you know cryptocurrency and all that and

53
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,520
here we are four years a lot of

54
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
a lot of things have changed a lot of

55
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,000
things have been built in four years

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,960
and uh yeah so

57
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,040
yeah it's funny did you know that uh

58
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
actually uh winnie the pooh is banned in

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
china

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,759
yeah so that's and uh you might get plus

61
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,000
20 social credit or minus social

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,119
uh 20 credit but maybe um oh i walked

63
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,520
over the line but maybe um

64
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,880
you know if we had uh anonymous

65
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
network level privacy then you would be

66
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,038
able to express yourself

67
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,080
if you wanted to share a picture of a

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,040
winnie the pooh

69
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,599
or another meme than you could without

70
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,440
fear of the state giving you

71
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,520
a bad credit score because and the same

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,440
thing goes for when you want to send a

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,120
cryptocurrency transaction

74
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,879
like these guys uh

75
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:29,920
well damn i don't know if i'm going to

76
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,080
read the whole thing but basically uh

77
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,560
he says that um don't you know internet

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,160
traffic is observable by

79
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,000
global passive adversaries like the

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,239
chinese government or the nsa

81
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,599
i use grin tor and signal or use monero

82
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,640
or use bitcoin

83
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,239
tor and signal on-chain metadata can be

84
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,400
harvested and exploited

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,440
but i use signal traffic analysis of

86
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
signal can reveal who's talking to who

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,239
when and where

88
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,519
so part of the part of the cypherpunk

89
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,800
trifecta

90
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
is uh peer-to-peer unsensible money

91
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,840
anonymous networking and

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,959
anonymous credentials so we have

93
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,080
arguably uh peer-to-peer unsensible

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
money we've done that pretty good

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,159
and so now we need to work on some other

96
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,760
things to bring us to the next

97
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,159
level

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,920
and here you go harry

99
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,518
so obviously uh

100
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,319
thanks for the i mean theo and me go

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,159
back 20 years

102
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,680
and uh i was actually here

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
i think 2017 or 16. i actually came

104
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,720
not because of i just saw that uh you

105
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
know the assassination guy market guy

106
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
was speaking i said oh man like david

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,480
bill

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,519
he's a legend i got to see him and i got

109
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,159
here

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,280
and you know it was really cool

111
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
atmosphere and

112
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
i met theo who encouraged me to quit my

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,640
job as a pointless academic

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
working on mixnets and trying to make

115
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,080
 a bit more real

116
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,239
and i even met adam back here and adam

117
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,840
back was like yeah mixed nets i tried to

118
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,519
sell those in the 90s and zero knowledge

119
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
systems that failed you should try again

120
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,319
so all the encouragement here uh is what

121
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:14,640
led

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,478
to larger than the nim so i'm very

123
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,720
honored to be speaking here to present

124
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,478
the fact that we presented this like

125
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
crazy idea in a lightning talk

126
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
in 2017. last year we presented like the

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
plan

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
and this year representing the first

129
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
stage of

130
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,639
the code the delivery of the plan and

131
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,400
the fact that you can even use it right

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,360
now

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,880
so yeah that was we didn't think that

134
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,360
was going to was never been done before

135
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,560
this is the first running mixnet

136
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,479
since uh that's live that's

137
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,919
decentralized different peers running

138
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,360
the mixes we have

139
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,880
over 350 nodes mixing traffic

140
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
uh and this is the biggest thing i was

141
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,720
showing to my old friend george denises

142
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,440
who unfortunately now works at libra

143
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,199
but he did this thing called mix master

144
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,600
back in the day the cypherpunk remailers

145
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
and he was like holy this is the

146
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,759
biggest mixnet we've ever had

147
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,600
and it's still quite small but we're

148
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,520
just saying it's starting to grow and by

149
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,880
next year

150
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,240
we plan to be you know take over the

151
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,960
world

152
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,800
so the the the the issue is the internet

153
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,160
inherently does not have

154
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
any level of privacy using a tcpi packet

155
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,080
you do the whole syn ack

156
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,199
dance your ip address is leaking a lot

157
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,639
of people like yo i'll use signal or

158
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,680
zcash

159
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
and it's not just the ip address tor

160
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,120
actually does a pretty good job at just

161
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
hiding your ip address

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
but tor leaks the volume and the timing

163
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,960
of the information

164
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
and you have to recreate these circuits

165
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
typically every 10 minutes or so or if

166
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,360
you recreate the circuits of every

167
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,320
transaction you kind of

168
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
stand out from the rest of the tor

169
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,000
network and so you do not have like a

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
large amount

171
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,280
of anonymity against an enemy which

172
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,639
observing like the nsa

173
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,440
both ends of the network and vpns are

174
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,880
mostly because you're just

175
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,600
moving

176
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,080
your route of trust from your laptop

177
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,840
which you might actually want to trust

178
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,720
to some guy like a nordvpn or whatnot

179
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,639
who is probably just going to back door

180
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,319
your ass and handle your data

181
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,560
to whoever wants it so we what we said

182
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,639
is that even with high-tech tech like

183
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,240
signal or z-cash they're all leaking

184
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,199
this meta

185
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,639
data all over the place so we um

186
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,199
wanted to fix that and we began fixing

187
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,440
it actually by doing interviews

188
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,960
with users uh actual people who were you

189
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,520
know

190
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,120
we actually did this large-scale

191
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
hundred-person study

192
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,319
uh of can people use shielded zcash

193
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,479
and the answer is no not at all actually

194
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,600
one quarter

195
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,039
could successfully purchase

196
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,120
using something i won't say what they

197
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,400
were purchasing actually they were going

198
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,639
purchasing uh anonymous vpss and domain

199
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,800
names from the jala and we actually gave

200
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,319
them the money at each step to like go

201
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,440
to the next step

202
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
and the fact i'm actually you know

203
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
writing tour trying to get a vpn working

204
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,759
getting confused over

205
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,400
shielded versus transparent transactions

206
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
it was a it was a catastrophe to

207
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,360
be honest

208
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
um and so we said well this is something

209
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
that should be fixed

210
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,400
um and while we were doing these

211
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,360
experiments

212
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,160
the corona happened and i think corona

213
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,120
really brought

214
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,800
out the political stakes of what we're

215
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,720
doing so

216
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,759
uh essentially

217
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,960
the the problem with corona is that it

218
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,680
has forced

219
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,560
the digital totalitization of our lives

220
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
very quickly

221
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,880
that even the the parts of our lives

222
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,560
such as education or government

223
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,639
services or health services which for

224
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,960
most resistance the digitization

225
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,199
have now fallen under the name of public

226
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,639
health our social life

227
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,240
and our social lives have been

228
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,800
incredibly restricted i think tomorrow

229
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,639
this conference would be illegal because

230
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
you can't have more than 10 people in

231
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,759
the same place

232
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,400
exactly and and this is all done the

233
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,039
name of

234
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,240
our own public health not uh

235
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,160
which somehow is supposed to supersede

236
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
uh politics and this has happened before

237
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,280
um the way i view this space

238
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,599
is that during the fall of roman empire

239
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,800
when we also had many

240
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
plagues like antoine plague and whatnot

241
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,599
a friend of mine a gombin who's quite

242
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,440
critical of the corona stuff i don't

243
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,879
agree with him and everything but

244
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,440
he made a good point he said the people

245
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
that fled

246
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,759
the existing society during the fall of

247
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,599
roman empire and the years of plague

248
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,280
fled to monasteries

249
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
but they weren't like the freaks they

250
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,479
weren't the people i mean people called

251
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,360
them freaks

252
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,240
but they were actually the best people

253
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,839
that the empire had produced the most

254
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,880
intelligent

255
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,719
the most thoughtful the most talented

256
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,839
uh and that has fled you monasteries to

257
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,560
escape

258
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,680
and that's i think what's happening

259
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
today that we are fleeing

260
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,959
this total catastrophe

261
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,120
of a world order which is dying before

262
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,320
our eyes

263
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
and there's a lot of people trying to

264
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,240
blame things on

265
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,880
uh russia as if history did not exist

266
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,399
before putin

267
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,880
uh they're saying oh trump you know

268
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
wikileaks helped elect trump fake news

269
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,360
is manipulating people we're all

270
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,640
essentially becoming tools of

271
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,600
some sort of apparatus and i actually

272
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
think

273
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
this is not true in

274
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,959
a large sense that humans do ultimately

275
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,519
have an

276
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,800
instinct for freedom

277
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
an instinct to express themselves and

278
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,040
what we need to provide we need to

279
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,440
provide

280
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,839
tools to make that possible and the

281
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,320
exact same tools which people are

282
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,519
using to quote unquote stop fake news

283
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,760
is essentially an architecture of and

284
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
also for our own health because of

285
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,399
corona

286
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
is an architecture of surveillance and

287
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,399
control in censorship

288
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,480
there is no ultimate difference between

289
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,560
content moderation

290
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
with quote unquote community guidelines

291
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,920
made by you know a bunch of random

292
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,600
feel-good woke liberals that work at

293
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
google

294
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,160
uh censorship by the chinese government

295
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,839
same architecture

296
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,360
and we will expect that this

297
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,600
architecture surveillance and censorship

298
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
will be weaponized more and more and

299
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760
more even from the left

300
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,079
last week chomsky got blocked from live

301
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,600
streaming on youtube

302
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
no facebook sorry so i mean it's

303
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,959
completely crazy

304
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,959
and as we try to escape and exit the

305
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,760
system

306
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,480
we're looking not only we're looking for

307
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:30,880
tries

308
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,640
ways to understand what is it that we're

309
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
trying to

310
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,320
protect and my friend alexi who can't

311
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,160
come here because of corona

312
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,680
has been trying to to comprehend

313
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,360
what this kind of freedom we're fighting

314
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,720
for is in some

315
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,120
more pacific level using what he calls

316
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
the right to digital integrity

317
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,519
so it's kind of like you know people in

318
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,880
most constitutions at least in

319
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,640
switzerland where i currently live

320
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,320
have the right to physical and mental

321
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,000
integrity

322
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
which guarantees your autonomy and your

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,560
freedom so it is illegal to for example

324
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,880
put you in chains like a slave

325
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,320
because that presents you from

326
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,560
physically acting

327
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,079
and by preventing you from physically

328
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,600
acting your autonomy

329
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,320
has been denied and that the data

330
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,839
protection rules don't really have like

331
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
a firm basis

332
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,480
uh and what alexia matches that there

333
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
should be a right to digital

334
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,200
integrity which guarantees our autonomy

335
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,320
in the digital space and

336
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,720
after the snowden revelations and a i

337
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
would say more

338
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,600
vague since snowden himself tried to

339
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,279
articulate this thing that we needed a

340
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,279
sort of with a tim berners lead inventor

341
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,079
of the web

342
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,839
we needed some sort of magna carta some

343
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,279
way to enforce

344
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,079
our rights our autonomy on the internet

345
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,680
in face of

346
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,079
mass surveillance and attempts to

347
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,680
control us

348
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,720
but these politically all failed

349
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,480
and what snowden said which is correct

350
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,000
the only thing when you have

351
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,320
general nation state failure that works

352
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
is cryptographic tools

353
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,839
cryptography can bind

354
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,240
uh even nation state level adversaries

355
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
and guarantee

356
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,079
freedom in a way that mere legislation

357
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,360
never can

358
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,959
and i don't want to go too deep into

359
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,839
that uh but i do think

360
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,839
that we are slowly seeing progress

361
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,519
alexia's been working and

362
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,200
various swiss cantons i think in valet

363
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,639
which is where a lot of people go skiing

364
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,240
he recently passed this right to digital

365
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
integrity in the constitution

366
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,440
and so we're trying to hope in the long

367
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,959
run to make switzerland

368
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,880
or at least yep at least roman

369
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,320
switzerland a kind of

370
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
island of digital autonomy and integrity

371
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,399
within what we believe is the collapse

372
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,920
of the new roman empire

373
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
so feel free to come to norwich hotel

374
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,120
and join us in our

375
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,040
new cypherpunk monastery we're not as

376
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
impressive as prague but

377
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,839
we're going to work on it um and there's

378
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,880
real demand for privacy from people

379
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
people want these kinds of cryptographic

380
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
tools but there's

381
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,120
fundamental problems and how they work

382
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,079
tor

383
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
had a huge spike of growth after the

384
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,440
stone revelations

385
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,880
but then fell back down it's been

386
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,680
maintaining a constant 6 000 nodes

387
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
ever since and streaming about the same

388
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,279
level of traffic

389
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,440
signal almost shut down but when trump

390
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800
got elected moxie was like i'm going to

391
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
keep it running

392
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,560
and it's having huge growth but it had a

393
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,079
huge problem with funding

394
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,160
brian acton the co-founder of whatsapp

395
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,079
gave moxie like 50 million and so now

396
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,120
it's still going

397
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,920
but there's still not uh

398
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
not a good way to to we need to figure

399
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,440
out how to get these projects going

400
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,199
and that's what happened to myself when

401
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,880
i came

402
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,839
to uh this conference a few years ago it

403
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,199
occurred to me

404
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,360
um i it that that this is this is the

405
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
kind that

406
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,880
bitcoin is the key to making this all

407
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,519
work

408
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,519
because this gives us the financial

409
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,639
sovereignty

410
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,800
and the new forms of capital formation

411
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,320
which are essentially a precondition for

412
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,800
building any kinds of new tools

413
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,240
and any kinds of new tools will be

414
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,639
necessary to survive the coming to be

415
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
honest probably genocides and

416
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
all sorts of terrible things will happen

417
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,079
as this empire

418
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,970
collapses um

419
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,519
[Music]

420
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,560
even uh julian assange noted this

421
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,480
i was an hpcc tv a few uh yesterday

422
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
when he noticed that the the most of

423
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
the quote-unquote internet freedom

424
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,000
community people working on

425
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
anti-censorship technologies

426
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,480
have been taken over by us funding he

427
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,519
asked

428
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,079
where did all the free people go where

429
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,000
did what happened to the cypherpunks and

430
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,839
i think they came here they all came to

431
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,079
bitcoin they came to cryptocurrency

432
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,760
and so what we're trying to do with this

433
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,120
project

434
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,839
is we're trying to basically build a new

435
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,600
kind of project

436
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,399
which complements bitcoin but adds the

437
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,360
anonymous communication channel that was

438
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,079
hypothesized

439
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,760
by the original cypherpunks and

440
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,000
anonymous credentials and makes it

441
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,480
financially sustainable to run this

442
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
infrastructure

443
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,079
so the first component is a mixnet i've

444
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,600
already described it last year but i'll

445
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,959
give it a quick overview

446
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,839
a mixnet has multiple hops like tor

447
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,760
but uh it adds a few new components

448
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,279
first it obstricates the timing of your

449
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,800
traffic by mixing them

450
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
like a deck of cards second it adds

451
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,160
cover traffic

452
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,199
so there's not enough traffic and

453
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,040
network you add fake traffic which helps

454
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,560
you become more anonymous

455
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
and unlike blockchains with sort of a

456
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,959
competition for limited blockchain space

457
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,040
uh mix that scale like the web you

458
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
simply add more mix nodes you can add

459
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,480
more you add more capacity

460
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,320
so it has a horizontal scalability in

461
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
fact the more people that use a mixnet

462
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,160
the more scalable it is because you

463
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,839
you're always anonymous inside a crowd

464
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,360
as that crowd gets bigger

465
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,240
you can do less and less mixing and less

466
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,399
cover traffic at the same level

467
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,079
of anon enemy so the comparison just to

468
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:54,480
be

469
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,360
brief you can see a vpn is just moving

470
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,959
your root of trust

471
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,959
tor is better than the vpn inarguably so

472
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,959
you have three hops so at least one node

473
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,399
can't correlate all your traffic but an

474
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
enemy that can watch both the entrant

475
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,320
exit nodes can do traffic correlation

476
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,279
attacks

477
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,279
so nim prevents that by again adding

478
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,639
fake cover traffic

479
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,040
adding altercation as observation of

480
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,839
timing

481
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,440
and essentially works sort of like this

482
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,279
you have an user agent

483
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,959
all your tcprp packets go to a local

484
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,480
client

485
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,560
this local client is a sox5 at least in

486
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,519
our current setup

487
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,199
could be http s proxy

488
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,399
you know 127.001

489
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,519
on port we use 1789.

490
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,199
it goes to that port it takes all of the

491
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,000
traffic converts

492
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,759
what's called sphinx packet format which

493
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,880
is the same packet format used by

494
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,680
lightning

495
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,360
which is a kind of constant size

496
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,199
re-randomizable packet so the packets

497
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,480
themselves all look alike and are

498
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,519
unlinkable

499
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,279
sends the packets through a mixnet those

500
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,920
mixnets changes the timing

501
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
to make it more anonymous and if you

502
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,199
have too many too much traffic you can

503
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,120
add more nodes to the network

504
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,119
and then the packets are anonymized

505
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,039
without revealing metadata

506
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,480
and so what we've done over the last

507
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,959
year is we actually built the damn thing

508
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,000
you can go and go to nimtech.net dot

509
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,119
slash docs

510
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,679
you can install a mix node to start

511
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,039
mixing traffic

512
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,079
uh it's quite

513
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,000
we it's still testing so we do do

514
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
upgrades if you can't figure out how to

515
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,000
install it we have a telegram chat

516
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,320
set up by hans brick who is part of this

517
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,360
group who's a

518
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,960
wonderful human being he's been

519
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,720
unfortunately has crona right now

520
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,600
but uh hopefully is watching from afar

521
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,160
and

522
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,640
uh he's been invaluable in helping set

523
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
up hundreds of nodes

524
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,320
and all of our code is open source you

525
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,760
can change it you can

526
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,360
download it you can tell us you find

527
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,120
bugs you can do pull requests we'd love

528
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,080
more of that

529
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,760
and then what we got working is we got

530
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,520
bitcoin overnim working

531
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
because anytime you have any kind of

532
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,760
bitcoin client that's using sox5

533
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,200
you can take that client

534
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,799
out put the nim client on

535
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,559
and then reader out your traffic into

536
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,400
the nem client so this is easy to do an

537
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,600
electrum

538
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,440
and we have it working with block stream

539
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,960
green so if you want confidence

540
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,080
transactions over liquid

541
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
that works and if you're particularly

542
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,679
crazy although we don't recommend people

543
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,200
do this you can even run

544
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,520
firefox and folks have even managed to

545
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,640
stream video

546
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,520
over nem so uh i'm not sure i really

547
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,120
recommend people do it do that right now

548
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,000
so we do have that

549
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,280
working um and this is we have

550
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,480
dashboard.nemtech.net has

551
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,840
over i currently i think 400 350

552
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,360
something like that nodes all over the

553
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,720
world running

554
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,799
mixing packets uh this is pretty amazing

555
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,679
stuff

556
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,799
and people they really you know when we

557
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,640
were running it just as a pure volunteer

558
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,240
thing we had like i don't know 20 30

559
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,200
nodes

560
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,799
and then we said uh we need

561
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,960
to basically we had people running

562
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,360
nymnodes in ghana and africa

563
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,799
some guy from minsk uh and belarus

564
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,360
and they they needed help financially so

565
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,919
we said we're gonna pay them in bitcoin

566
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,799
and we'll

567
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,679
and then that covers their cost but

568
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,400
people often

569
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,919
they wanted some sort of reputation

570
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,240
score reputation scores and mixed nets

571
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
a really old problem it's what adam back

572
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,160
used to work on before block stream

573
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,320
and so we said well we should give them

574
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,840
some sort of token

575
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,200
and because it's a test net we call it

576
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,640
nymph not nem and we use liquid

577
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,480
uh which is controversial but i think

578
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,240
the right choice at the time

579
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,080
and it's still the right choice and we

580
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
put these sort of

581
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,679
reputation scores as a sort of token on

582
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,360
uh on on liquid and you can see

583
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,160
at a glance in your wallet how long your

584
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,880
mix node's been

585
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,080
up and then at the end of the month

586
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,520
based on how long you've been up and

587
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,840
many other things uh currently actually

588
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,160
we just we send out bitcoin to reward

589
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,120
you

590
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,799
um and in the future we're gonna work on

591
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,559
ways of pledging nymph

592
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,360
and using them to basically make mixed

593
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
nodes more reliable so if you go down

594
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,799
you get punished

595
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,480
if you're up you get rewarded currently

596
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,799
we don't punish anyone we just give you

597
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,039
nymph tokens and bitcoin and i would

598
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,640
like to actually thank adam back and

599
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,000
block stream despite the fact

600
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,080
that there are many conspiracy theories

601
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,679
around block stream adam uh

602
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,640
we talked in many different groups uh we

603
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,760
we haven't figured out how to talk to

604
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,400
monero

605
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,080
people yet so if any monero people the

606
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,120
audience we really want to talk we're

607
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,799
trying to understand the code base and

608
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,120
how to integrate against monero but like

609
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,799
you know zcash was a

610
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,799
a mess and

611
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,360
blockstream really really provided i

612
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,159
think

613
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,280
excellent excellent support for nim and

614
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,559
has been uh

615
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,679
completely on our side and completely

616
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,760
helping trying to help privacy um

617
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,200
and then in the future what we're going

618
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,039
to do

619
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,720
is we're going to i mean currently we

620
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,120
kind of pay for your

621
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
your services your computing services

622
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
the mix node at a kind of flat rate

623
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,320
what we eventually want to do is make

624
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
this more sustainable

625
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,120
and the way to make this more

626
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,679
sustainable is a algorithm

627
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,240
it's kind of a proof of mixing algorithm

628
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,280
which can determine

629
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,159
how much bitcoin you should be rewarded

630
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,200
with

631
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,320
uh based on how much you're mixing

632
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,760
and um this will be a could be a whole

633
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,679
talk by itself i'll give you the

634
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,400
very brief version which is essentially

635
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,679
uh the nice thing about anonymous

636
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,159
packets is you don't know who sent it

637
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,120
so the system itself can generate just

638
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,559
as we genuinely tour

639
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,039
kind of pool of shared randomness the

640
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,559
randomness can be used to seed what's

641
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,720
called a verifiable random function

642
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,880
the variable random function can then be

643
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,799
used to randomly and fairly sample

644
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,440
pass through a mixed network like hop

645
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,039
one

646
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,520
and layer one hop node let's say you

647
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,159
know node

648
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,520
x and layer two in node z and layer

649
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,240
three

650
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,880
and then you can essentially keep

651
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,919
running that process over and over again

652
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,880
and statistically sample

653
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,720
the health of the network and reward

654
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,799
people proportionately and that you

655
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,159
cannot distinguish

656
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,919
the reward traffic we use from

657
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,840
other traffic and the big trick which

658
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,679
i'll just mention very briefly

659
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,840
is that when you send messages over

660
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,960
lightning or

661
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,919
nim we use the same packet format it's

662
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,919
called sphinx and there's a

663
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,760
nonce which exists for replay attack

664
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
protection and you can just write that

665
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,000
nonsense

666
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,400
miracle tree at the end of each time

667
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,159
period maybe every few hours maybe a few

668
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,039
minutes we haven't quite

669
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,799
we'll figure that out empirically over

670
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,600
the test next existence

671
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,280
we reveal what the reward traffic is

672
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,440
and that and then you can prove because

673
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
that reward traffic has

674
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,200
a non-spur hop you can prove that you

675
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
saw that traffic and you can say i

676
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
delivered it and that guy can either

677
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,360
prove or prove

678
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,760
not that he did get that packet and we

679
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,880
can so we can preserve unlinkability

680
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,400
while basically um preserve

681
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
the kind of integrity of the whole

682
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,080
system while fairly rewarding the

683
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,520
traffic and that's much better this is

684
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,880
again a whole nother talk

685
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,679
than paying by hop which is done by like

686
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,919
scammy ethereum projects like hopper

687
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,600
or uh you know even lightning

688
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,720
because there's lots of attacks on

689
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,880
paying by hop i can for example

690
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,120
thin stuff to just my friends or drop

691
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,919
packets and

692
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,000
we're trying to prevent this by taking

693
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,320
advantage of the anonymous nature

694
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,279
of packets inside nem and then using

695
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,559
that to basically

696
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,279
have a fair proof of mixing uh algorithm

697
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,600
that's what we're currently working on

698
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,240
um yeah and so how we

699
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,480
what we do is in order to basically we

700
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,640
need to somehow take

701
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,320
obviously it's a test net we're like

702
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,600
paying from everything from our own

703
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,559
bitcoin because

704
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,919
we're wonderful people we really want to

705
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,000
see the network grow but eventually

706
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,559
the network itself has to be sustainable

707
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,000
and we know how that work i mean in

708
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,880
theory

709
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,320
and perhaps hopefully one day in

710
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,559
practice bitcoin will be sustainable

711
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,159
because there's a transaction fee taken

712
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,520
and that transaction fee pays the

713
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,240
network

714
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,600
and this is probably what we should do

715
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,279
as well and you can imagine i would like

716
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,279
to know people's opinion on this

717
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,400
if i'm sitting a bitcoin transaction

718
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,440
or you know something uh else monero

719
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,640
whatever

720
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,039
and i want to be more private how much

721
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,000
you know what

722
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
how many how much sense what

723
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,600
low amount would you pay for a kind of

724
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,840
privacy transaction fee

725
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,279
and then the problem with privacy

726
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,440
transaction fees is you don't want to

727
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,320
dox yourself by paying the fee

728
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,679
you don't want to dox other and the

729
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,360
mixed nodes you don't want to

730
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,799
de-anonymize people so the technology

731
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,120
that

732
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,799
is not quite built but will be built

733
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,240
very soon and we hope to have a big

734
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,480
surprise for one on november 5th

735
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,200
is anonymous credential technology based

736
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
on what's called the coconut signature

737
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,760
scheme

738
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,240
uh which will basically allow us to

739
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,760
anonymously

740
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,039
taking a non-anonymous cryptocurrency

741
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,480
and this is relatively close to us i

742
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,000
think some of the stuff that uh frank

743
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,400
and

744
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,279
smuggler working with opaque link uh

745
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,799
need to look into the details

746
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,240
but essentially take a non-anonymous

747
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,640
cryptocurrency turn it

748
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,039
into a way to pay people kind of micro

749
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,400
payments

750
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,600
anonymously without uh doxing themselves

751
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,919
and adding even additional data

752
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,240
i mean i i absolutely am not a huge fan

753
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,760
of centralized exchanges but if you

754
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,159
don't

755
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,039
people do use them i you know i don't

756
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,080
personally but

757
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,919
we know people do and they now all these

758
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,440
horrible kyc

759
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,240
these crazy aml rules uh and so we're

760
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,880
trying to build

761
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,320
so the anonymous conditions can also let

762
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
you privately

763
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,400
uh verify yourself and do whatever other

764
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,640
weird stuff you have to do

765
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,480
without doxing yourself or revealing it

766
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
to the whole network

767
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,760
and this is a decentralized scheme and

768
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,840
that's the big breakthrough we've had is

769
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,200
that we've taken essentially some sort

770
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,679
of

771
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,360
charming anonymous credential scheme and

772
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
we've made it work on threshold

773
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,720
signatures

774
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,120
and so the crypto economics or economics

775
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,320
we could say

776
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,480
is uh in brief users would like to use

777
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,679
the mixed net they would like to access

778
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,120
services privately

779
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,039
and they will pay a transaction fee

780
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,480
possibly we'll discuss that in one

781
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,600
second

782
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,919
validators say oh you paid a transaction

783
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,039
fee how great

784
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,400
and then they hand that user an

785
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,080
anonymous credential that proves that

786
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,000
they've paid it a transaction fee

787
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,919
the user walks up to the mixed network

788
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,200
is like hey i paid then on

789
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,559
the transaction fee and they're like

790
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,240
great based on that transaction fee we

791
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,080
give you access to the network or not if

792
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,760
there's too much demand

793
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,600
then maybe you don't get in if there's

794
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,880
not enough you just get in it's just

795
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,440
like you know

796
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,600
copying bitcoin effectively and then the

797
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,640
mixed nodes then

798
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,880
get rewarded based on those transaction

799
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,240
fees based on the amount of mixing

800
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,799
they've done

801
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,320
via this proof of mixing algorithm i

802
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,000
outlined very briefly

803
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,600
and then users can access service

804
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
providers which are

805
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,279
not hidden servers really but this is

806
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,039
the kind of other end of the app that's

807
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,480
using them

808
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,039
and then they're happy they can use this

809
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,159
network to have

810
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,320
people access their service privately

811
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,760
and if the service provider you know i

812
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,200
don't want to be charged per message to

813
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,799
use signal or something

814
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,360
nonsensical like that so what you can

815
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,000
imagine

816
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,799
apps like signal could hook into nim by

817
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,880
just kind of paying these transaction

818
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
fees in bulk

819
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,320
for their users ahead of time and then

820
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,760
handing out these credentials to their

821
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,480
users

822
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,880
when they install software so just be it

823
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,480
would be transparent look it would look

824
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,120
free

825
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,600
but we would be charging moxie some

826
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,320
hopefully relatively not so unbearable

827
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,399
amount of funds and the funds then goes

828
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,080
back to pay for the mix nodes so that's

829
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,679
the kind of economic

830
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,039
background and then what essentially the

831
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,080
economics do is economics balance the

832
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,919
supply of privacy

833
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,399
which is provided by the mix nodes

834
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,679
themselves

835
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,720
with the demand for the users for

836
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,919
privacy

837
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,840
and this demand is given by the users

838
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,279
kind of accessing the system via these

839
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,200
credentials and going to these apps

840
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
and then every kind of app is different

841
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,399
like if i'm

842
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,720
using cryptocurrency i often i'm okay if

843
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,240
my transaction's a bit slow i really

844
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,919
want it to be super private

845
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,520
and i can set that kind of preferred

846
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,200
latency in the app

847
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,320
if i'm on the other hand sending a

848
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,520
signal message

849
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,320
i might want to be a bit faster so you

850
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,039
can set

851
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,480
in your client your own latency

852
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,559
and you can set you know if you don't

853
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,159
really know you can say i actually want

854
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,360
to be this anonymous and we'll figure

855
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,799
out the latency for you

856
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,840
we have the mathematics of that sorted

857
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
uh via simulation heart interestingly

858
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,960
enough

859
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,360
and then basically as more people use

860
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,520
the network we can calculate the entropy

861
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,279
for the entire network which is the

862
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,520
anatomy provided for everyone

863
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,600
and over time as the network grows

864
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,640
supply and demand ideally reach an

865
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
equilibrium point

866
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
and of course the equilibrium changes

867
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,760
over time and as that equilibrium

868
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,679
changes over time based on the

869
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,279
transaction fees the amount of traffic

870
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,600
and the amount of anonymity people want

871
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,919
mixed nodes can be subtracted if they're

872
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,760
horrible you put on a raspberry pi

873
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,440
you go offline you close you put on your

874
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
laptop you close your laptop

875
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,120
we eventually kick you off the network

876
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,200
or mixednodes can be added

877
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,440
as needed and the way we add it is we

878
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,559
sort of say we'll pay we have these

879
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,320
transaction fees and it would pay for

880
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,200
your

881
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,559
your running of the node and you could

882
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,440
make some hefty amount of profit if you

883
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,720
do it well and that's

884
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,799
the nem system as a whole so again we

885
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,559
built the first part of the system

886
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,240
you can use the day although it's still

887
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,000
very much testing and we only provide

888
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,240
third-party anatomy we're not providing

889
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,279
full sender receiver on linkability

890
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,960
that's next in our agenda and we use

891
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,640
that using this technology called serbs

892
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,520
single use for

893
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,720
reply blocks which i'm not going to

894
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,880
discuss here in detail but essentially

895
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,120
i send you a message i'm going to be

896
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,600
anonymous i want you to respond to me

897
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,039
because if you send an anonymous message

898
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,000
and you don't know if the guy got it

899
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,679
it's kind of useless sometimes

900
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,919
who knows what happened uh so you send

901
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:02,880
them like a

902
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,640
sort of dropbox dead drop in the mix net

903
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,080
and they send a message

904
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,520
back to that dead drop and that has

905
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,799
another dead drop and you kind of play

906
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,000
this dead drop game

907
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,840
over and over and over again and that

908
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,360
basically gets

909
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,600
your uh you get cinder and receiver

910
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
unlinkability which means you get

911
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,200
anonymity on both sides of the equation

912
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
and then the next thing we want to do is

913
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
uh you know obviously we're talking

914
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,240
about transaction fees these are

915
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,760
relatively small amounts of bitcoin so

916
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,279
we need to integrate lightning

917
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,559
and we're looking very hard at lightning

918
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,399
particularly anya who works for us

919
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,679
uh trying to understand the privacy

920
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,679
project provides if we can become

921
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,520
better nim can be thought of almost as a

922
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,440
slow and really anonymous

923
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,960
kind of thing like lightning but we also

924
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,720
may need lightning itself

925
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,200
to deliver micropayments and of course

926
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,399
we want to add and this is

927
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,039
you know done for the people here most

928
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,720
we did a survey and most of our

929
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,640
users really want bitcoin about 70

930
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,480
percent of bitcoin maxies

931
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,640
but about 20 want monero and who else to

932
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,840
say so we're going to try to integrate

933
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,960
monero

934
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,640
next and the last thing i want to say is

935
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,320
we must support julian assange

936
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,039
um and the reason is to be honest when

937
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,519
we were starting this project

938
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,640
uh we had encouragement from people here

939
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,960
uh but one of the people and i visited

940
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,360
him in embassy and

941
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,679
who was i think most you know assange

942
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,880
wanted to see

943
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,360
better technology because he as someone

944
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,519
who was actively under threat

945
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,559
understood that um

946
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,240
global passive adversaries which are

947
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,600
very real threat nation state love

948
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,720
adversaries for assange

949
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,880
were monitoring his communication and he

950
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,640
became and he he wanted some way to

951
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,760
fight back

952
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,480
and so he was actually quite supportive

953
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,200
over both the cryptocurrency community

954
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,600
and the use of anonymous communication

955
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,760
technology like mixnets

956
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,480
and i think he's given us quite a lot

957
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,559
both philosophically

958
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,519
and practically uh in terms of kind of

959
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,279
understanding our situation and the

960
00:31:59,279 --> 00:31:59,679
things

961
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,760
and really has changed world history and

962
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,399
i am absolutely astonished at the level

963
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,559
of media blackout

964
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,440
and i am i am absolutely terrified of

965
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,880
the amount of

966
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,440
lack of solidarity he's been shown by

967
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
the world in general despite all the

968
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,360
fact that you know he's helped in the

969
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,039
iraq war and so regardless of how many

970
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,720
people feel about assange

971
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,120
you know the fact of the matter is no

972
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,519
matter how bad a person is

973
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,760
or how wonderful they are it doesn't

974
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,159
matter if you're a saint or sinner

975
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,039
no one should be extradited from their

976
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,080
home country

977
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,799
to another country to be imprisoned

978
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,000
forever and you shouldn't be actually

979
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,039
from anywhere

980
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,919
and if the athan is in the uk as an

981
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,279
australian citizen is actually

982
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,159
back to the us for essentially pissing

983
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:46,799
off

984
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,039
the us government under this quote

985
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,360
unquote espionage act if this

986
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,960
passes then any of us could be

987
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,120
extradited at any time and that's

988
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,880
incredibly dangerous

989
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,039
so we absolutely must see them through

990
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,240
for this court case

991
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,080
and even if he does go in we must

992
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,559
continue i think the vision that himself

993
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,640
and many other cypherpunks laid out by

994
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,799
pursuing anonymous communication and nem

995
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,320
is not the end goal

996
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,120
it's a small part of a puzzle it's like

997
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,480
a it's like a finger

998
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,799
and a hand but together that those

999
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,640
fingers can form a fist

1000
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,120
and hopefully bring down the existing

1001
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,240
regime

1002
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,519
so if you're interested uh

1003
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,760
if you're interested that's our telegram

1004
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,880
channel

1005
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,279
uh i go in and out of attention but i'll

1006
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,960
try to be there as much as possible

1007
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
that's our website where you can figure

1008
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
out and there's most importantly the

1009
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,200
docs where you can figure out how to

1010
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,640
install and run a node

1011
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,600
and hopefully next year we'll come back

1012
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,720
and we'll show you the whole

1013
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,559
cool bitcoin transaction layer stuff

1014
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,919
working out even better

1015
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,440
we'll have not just hundreds of mixed

1016
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,200
nodes but maybe thousands

1017
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,600
and we will have a anonymous

1018
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,039
communication layer

1019
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,799
for the 21st century thank you so much

1020
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:07,840
thank you very much

1021
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,800
question there

1022
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,079
okay uh first of all thank you for that

1023
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,359
it's very interesting

1024
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,560
i do have a couple of different

1025
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,839
questions so i'll try to go through them

1026
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:20,879
pretty quickly

1027
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,239
uh first of all you mentioned

1028
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,079
switzerland is the new haven my

1029
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,199
understanding is that

1030
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,280
as of a couple months ago switzerland

1031
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,960
had passed some kind of law

1032
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,440
making it difficult or even illegal for

1033
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,119
swiss crypto companies

1034
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,520
to transact with non-kyc or

1035
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,760
non-regulated counterparties

1036
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,079
in other words switzerland is trying to

1037
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,480
create a chinese firewall between the

1038
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,239
um okay kyc aml'd above ground

1039
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,000
crypto universe and block off the

1040
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,320
underground non-kyc cypherpunk world

1041
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,480
um do you know anything about that yeah

1042
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,400
so again i'm not swiss

1043
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,320
i'm just there because i i don't wanna i

1044
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,680
i don't wanna be in the united states

1045
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,480
right now

1046
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,119
um as exile you kind of take whatever

1047
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,480
country wants you you know you can't be

1048
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,359
like too picky

1049
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,960
but at the same point i agree

1050
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,640
switzerland is not a perfect it's

1051
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,240
actually incredibly expensive and has

1052
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,160
conservative elements definitely

1053
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
in fact they nearly banned immigration i

1054
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,680
think in a vote almost the game was

1055
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,200
actually surprisingly close

1056
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,280
so um the the work that i i alexi is the

1057
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,960
swiss he could explain it better but his

1058
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
work is to try to put

1059
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,079
privacy and digital integrity into like

1060
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,599
the constitutional framework

1061
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,720
and a decent choice way through the

1062
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,760
cantons that does not necessarily mean

1063
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,119
that switzerland will make like will

1064
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,200
become a cypherpunk haven in fact

1065
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,960
it's it's mostly known as a banking

1066
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,880
haven and

1067
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,640
as a banking haven what's happening to

1068
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,079
all banking havens over the world right

1069
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,040
now is because

1070
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,079
of uh the travel rule and the fatf rules

1071
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,640
and

1072
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,040
all these forces they're trying to

1073
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,680
basically

1074
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,839
split bitcoin and cryptocurrency into

1075
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,839
two into like a kyc as you put it kyc

1076
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:56,320
aml

1077
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,920
element and a non-kyc dml element uh

1078
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,320
that's kind of you know it's not

1079
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,680
surprising that's happening

1080
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,160
my understanding of the current

1081
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,960
cryptocurrency regulations in

1082
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,160
switzerland

1083
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,079
is that it depends on the amount you're

1084
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,520
sending so

1085
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,119
i think if it's like five thousand but

1086
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,400
it may have been recently reduced to two

1087
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
or three thousand that that doesn't need

1088
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,720
to be kyc aml but that's only on the

1089
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,240
uh fiat uh out ramps and on-ramps now

1090
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,400
the fact of the matter is in the long

1091
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,880
run i think we will have to go to

1092
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,160
i forget the term it's hyper

1093
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,800
bitcoinization but effectively like if

1094
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,280
they do

1095
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,839
actually use these laws including in

1096
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,280
places like switzerland to actually shut

1097
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,480
down fiat

1098
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,839
on off ramps then we will have no choice

1099
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,200
even if we would like

1100
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,240
to use the local country coin uh to

1101
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,280
basically go with pure bitcoin and i

1102
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,800
think that may be the future there's a

1103
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,920
pretty good experiment going on right

1104
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,200
now in this conference it's working

1105
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,480
quite well i always enjoy this

1106
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
conference for that reason and i do

1107
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,280
think that

1108
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,359
that the push to prevent the growth

1109
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,079
of peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies is more

1110
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,680
of a symbol of the banks

1111
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,200
freaking out about their loss of power

1112
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,640
and i don't know if like they'll be able

1113
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
to actually maintain that level of

1114
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,599
pressure forever

1115
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,680
and if they do then we just have to push

1116
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,280
harder for hyper bitcoinization and

1117
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
switzerland is no by no means a panacea

1118
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,560
in this regard i'm sure there are other

1119
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,920
countries that have better

1120
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
kyc aml rules but i think the problem is

1121
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,200
you don't do any of them

1122
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,320
then you basically kicked out the

1123
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,720
banking system uh in switzerland because

1124
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
their entire economy is based on

1125
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
the global banking system not on bitcoin

1126
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,760
they're they're naturally

1127
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,599
trying to like figure out how to comply

1128
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,599
with those rules i think the idea isn't

1129
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,079
so much

1130
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,280
to block off uh fiat on and off

1131
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,000
ramps

1132
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,240
but to make it impossible that if you

1133
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,560
say buy bitcoin on coinbase

1134
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,640
that you then can't send bitcoin to a

1135
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,760
non-kyc

1136
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,400
exchange or non-kyc wallet yeah but then

1137
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,079
the centralized exchanges are kind of

1138
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,880
might die off right i mean it's it's

1139
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,599
seeing

1140
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,520
bisque seeing this rise these crazy

1141
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,760
dexes and stuff i do think

1142
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,560
uh even all the insanity happening on

1143
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,040
the d5 space i i do think that that

1144
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,480
maybe that will that's why i said like

1145
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,320
if they keep pushing so hard

1146
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,960
to fracture bitcoin into two then i

1147
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,440
think

1148
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,040
we have to push harder for hyper

1149
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,640
bitcoinization

1150
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,599
because then a bitcoin will be

1151
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,960
impossible to to use what fiat currency

1152
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
okay next question um you talked about

1153
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,240
funding nodes

1154
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,720
uh one thing i didn't see talk about was

1155
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,520
paying

1156
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,599
exit nodes extra because of course the

1157
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,839
costs and hassle of running an exit node

1158
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,680
is considerably higher

1159
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,320
yeah no well that's because nemes is

1160
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,680
really weird architecture

1161
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,560
which i i almost don't want to so we

1162
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,040
don't

1163
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,160
so you can run an exit node so we we

1164
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,280
have this notion of what's called the

1165
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,560
service provider so

1166
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,000
in our mind we were building this we

1167
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,640
weren't thinking about web surfing

1168
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,839
we were thinking of signal right and we

1169
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,280
were said well you know if you're client

1170
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,960
on signal you have the signal server and

1171
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,760
you want to be anonymous but when you're

1172
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,040
touching that server it's a very

1173
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,320
non-peer-to-peer but

1174
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,000
is it actually useful paradigm that lots

1175
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,240
of the world follows so we want to not

1176
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,560
so

1177
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,079
the the user is running signal on their

1178
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,800
machine and the service provider is like

1179
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,320
moxie running a server

1180
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
and so with that level there's no exit

1181
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,480
node right you're just trying to hide

1182
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,320
the fact that you're using signal for

1183
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,560
anyone watching your internet connection

1184
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,880
now the other model which is the more

1185
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,720
tor model or vpn model

1186
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,839
it's just an open internet proxy right

1187
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,400
and so that service provider is not

1188
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,960
like moxie's server that server's

1189
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
provider is like

1190
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,599
essentially a tunnel the open internet

1191
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,320
and is therefore essentially a vpn

1192
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,359
or a tor

1193
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,480
exit node and yes on that level

1194
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,560
it's friggin dangerous right because who

1195
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,240
knows what people will throw over that

1196
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,599
uh and we do believe that there are

1197
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,440
economic models

1198
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,000
to make those sustainable but we have

1199
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,160
not built that economics into the system

1200
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,280
a because we don't know

1201
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,760
quite how that works but it is something

1202
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,839
that we are trying to think about

1203
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,440
and there's nothing to prevent someone

1204
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,040
from running

1205
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,839
an exit node that being said to be very

1206
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,100
honest

1207
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,000
[Music]

1208
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
open internet access is a hard problem

1209
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,839
the entry point is also hard so we have

1210
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,760
this notion of gateways we can add

1211
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,079
censorship resistant technologies

1212
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:20,960
particularly like

1213
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,440
shadow socks variant things in china

1214
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,000
observation

1215
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,359
proxy in in europe uh but

1216
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,599
we're not trying to make a pure open

1217
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,720
internet proxy

1218
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
we try to customize it per app so when

1219
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,079
we build something

1220
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,839
like bitcoin over nem the service

1221
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,160
provider

1222
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,359
you know it's like if you're using block

1223
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,760
stream it's like the block stream server

1224
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,520
uh it's like your full node at the other

1225
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,280
end if you're using a light wallet

1226
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,480
and that full node then does the

1227
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,960
broadcast so you go through the mixnet

1228
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,240
and then that service provider does the

1229
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,079
broadcast so on this level

1230
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,760
we're trying to we don't really have

1231
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,720
open endpoints built into the entire

1232
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,440
system

1233
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,520
but they're an option and we do not have

1234
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,440
a particular economic

1235
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,200
scheme to sustain open endpoints but we

1236
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,880
do believe people will figure that out

1237
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,000
probably

1238
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,960
okay um two more all right sorry just

1239
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,000
may introduce you

1240
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,079
are there any other questions they're

1241
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,599
very good questions how many of them are

1242
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,640
here just

1243
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,720
raise your hand these last two are going

1244
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,598
to take about 30 seconds

1245
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,440
global passive adversary that is now

1246
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,720
available commercially

1247
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
um because there are commercial entities

1248
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
which now have gpa capability is no

1249
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,560
longer just the nsa

1250
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,640
um the other thing was you talked about

1251
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,079
you named some of those entities because

1252
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,440
obviously chain analysis on bitcoin but

1253
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,640
what some other entities you think um

1254
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,920
i'd have to look it up

1255
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,480
these are more in the domain of internet

1256
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,520
companies that have

1257
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,560
netflow data um there's been a couple of

1258
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,599
articles on it i don't remember the

1259
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,880
exact references

1260
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,839
um but since we have uh we're short on

1261
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:50,240
time

1262
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,319
uh you mentioned the assange trial one

1263
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,920
thing we saw with the assange trial was

1264
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,720
a lot of

1265
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,280
shadow banning by facebook and twitter

1266
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,880
so that people who were covering the

1267
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,839
assange trial

1268
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,240
were getting a lot less traffic and this

1269
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,920
really shows the value of

1270
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,800
decentralized communications because all

1271
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,680
of a sudden the

1272
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,560
global discourse can be controlled by

1273
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,079
facebook and twitter

1274
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,079
and they can just say okay we don't want

1275
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,359
anybody to think about the assange

1276
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,640
trials so we won't let them

1277
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,240
i agree completely and that the horrible

1278
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,520
thing is i think to a large extent

1279
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,880
except in communities like this one they

1280
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,599
have been

1281
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,319
successful it's very difficult to

1282
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,839
discover information about the assange

1283
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:26,240
trial

1284
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,560
without considerable work or you know

1285
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,400
and this is crazy because this trial has

1286
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
such huge ramifications

1287
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,319
on the very concepts of like freedom and

1288
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,440
sovereignty

1289
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,119
and how nation states relate to each

1290
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,480
other i'm not surprised the u.s is

1291
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,160
pushing very hard because of vault 7 i

1292
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,280
think in particular to put him in jail

1293
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,480
forever

1294
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,960
um i think and he's being prosecuted for

1295
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,560
maybe the best thing he ever did

1296
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,359
which is iraq war releases which ended

1297
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,079
the iraq war

1298
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,160
to some extent uh and he is considered a

1299
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,079
hero by many people across the world and

1300
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,200
tunisia and other countries where

1301
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,240
wikileaks

1302
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,000
did very concretely help the cause of

1303
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,119
human freedom and i think that's

1304
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,000
undeniable

1305
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,079
and the fact that no one is reporting on

1306
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,400
it is absolutely crazy

1307
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,680
and it shows yeah 100 we have to we have

1308
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,200
to build the tech now because this this

1309
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,240
sort of stuff will continue

1310
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,520
assange is not will not be the last

1311
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,119
uh yeah thank you and then one more

1312
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,079
question

1313
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,000
sure um that was a hard hack to follow

1314
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,920
uh kudos to you for going to see assange

1315
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,599
i walked past the embassy a dozen times

1316
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,880
so i was too scared to go in

1317
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,079
so that's disappointing um a few things

1318
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,359
what's your runway what's your runway to

1319
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:31,920
like

1320
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,480
launch oh well you know i mean like

1321
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,040
financially

1322
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,800
it's technically harder than you look

1323
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,640
than it looks right so

1324
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,680
uh we think we might be able to get

1325
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,680
a main net out in six months maybe

1326
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,800
quicker

1327
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,640
um and we're fine with that that's not a

1328
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,160
big deal um yeah

1329
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,000
if if we don't you will tell you on

1330
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,400
twitter that we need donations but

1331
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,319
i think i think we can pull off given

1332
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,079
the current team the current system

1333
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,040
a a kind of basic main net uh but and we

1334
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,599
have

1335
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,040
good concepts as i've just demonstrated

1336
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,040
for solving the hard economic problems

1337
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,200
the the real question is is can it

1338
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,079
really

1339
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,920
we we do need part actually what we need

1340
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,599
more than money

1341
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,200
is we need partners that are willing to

1342
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,640
run mixed nodes but not just run mixed

1343
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,680
nodes but we really need

1344
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,359
you are not you're anonymous in terms of

1345
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,880
how many other people use the system

1346
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,599
so if someone like signal or someone you

1347
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,880
know blockchain has been great but like

1348
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,800
some other wallets wanted to throw in

1349
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,280
um if we can get more users in the

1350
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,079
system

1351
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,480
that will make the system much more

1352
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,839
resilient and more knowledge for

1353
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:32,800
everyone

1354
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,400
and that's what we need and i'm actually

1355
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,280
actively looking for monero people

1356
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,960
i'm looking for people that can help us

1357
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,480
build apps on top of this network

1358
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,000
because there is a minor

1359
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,400
bit of integration that has to be done

1360
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,000
the client's pretty straightforward with

1361
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,599
fox5 but if you're doing something a bit

1362
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,960
more complicated on this on like a

1363
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,079
server side

1364
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,760
or you have like a real peer-to-peer

1365
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,160
framework uh then it's it's actually

1366
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,040
more work

1367
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,359
and we can help that work happen but if

1368
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,560
we launch this thing

1369
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,319
next year and we have runway to get

1370
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,680
there but we launch it

1371
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,160
and there's no users or there's not many

1372
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,000
just a few crazy freaks

1373
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,599
it's not going to be a great system so

1374
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,359
what about using ethereum because i know

1375
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,960
zuk's working closely with vitalik on

1376
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,560
sudden case and arcs and privacy

1377
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,720
oh i mean i have a tremendous

1378
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,920
i don't know where to start with

1379
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,079
ethereum uh

1380
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,520
wow let me think about how to say this

1381
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,680
nicely um

1382
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,240
there's a reason we we chose liquid uh

1383
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:26,720
so

1384
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,119
a the the there's not this gas fee thing

1385
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,040
which is completely

1386
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,640
crazy uh we have had some good

1387
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,359
experiences talking with other projects

1388
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,760
but in our experience uh our um

1389
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,599
the ethereum community like we we talked

1390
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,359
about mixed nets

1391
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,720
and then like you know some like random

1392
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
you know 19 year old like forks a code

1393
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,800
base we abandoned like oh it's amazing

1394
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,640
like they're just not technically they

1395
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,079
don't really understand network level

1396
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,000
privacy and they don't seem pretty

1397
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,359
they're interested in privacy only as a

1398
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,400
means to make ethereum scale using zero

1399
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,680
knowledge proof so we've actually found

1400
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,599
much more support

1401
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,040
uh from the bitcoin to be honest bitcoin

1402
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,319
maximalist

1403
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,000
than we have from the ethereum community

1404
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,760
and i think ethereum is

1405
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,240
as a whole is going to have scalability

1406
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,440
problems which

1407
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,480
our co-founder dave predicted and made a

1408
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,520
charting solution years ago and ethereum

1409
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,680
ignored it and facebook bought it

1410
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,720
so uh i think ethereum's kind of maybe i

1411
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,839
don't know the problems that ethereum is

1412
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,240
facing are solvable and i'm not sure

1413
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,440
if that community prioritizes privacy so

1414
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,200
we're interested in communities

1415
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,000
which prioritize privacy and which

1416
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,079
provides solutions that work today not

1417
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,240
two or three years down the road

1418
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,839
and that's why we we haven't dealt too

1419
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,119
much within your community that being

1420
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,079
said i am very excited by simplicity

1421
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,640
the kind of uh this sort of block

1422
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,560
bitcoin scripting language

1423
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,560
i'm interested in any kinds of attempts

1424
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,359
to add smart contract functionality

1425
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,880
uh to bitcoin and also we are not

1426
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,760
bitcoin maximalist because that's crazy

1427
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,880
if you're running an

1428
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,400
anatomy network we paid people on

1429
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,319
bitcoin because bitcoin is sound money i

1430
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:09,440
don't think i need to explain it to

1431
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,720
people here i don't want to pay people

1432
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,560
saying which isn't sound money

1433
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,359
that being said uh to be anonymous you

1434
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,520
need a crowd so we use many different

1435
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,680
crazy blockchain people even people you

1436
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,119
may not agree with

1437
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,319
using this network um and that's

1438
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,040
essential to building a large-scale

1439
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,480
anonymity set

1440
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,040
and so if there was tons of interest

1441
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,880
from ethereum which there isn't they act

1442
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,119
uh right now at least we'd be inter

1443
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,200
we're not going to reject

1444
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,680
them uh just but you know we we have

1445
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,960
been you know people some people don't

1446
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,640
like it z cash is doing their own weird

1447
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,240
thing with tor and dandelion which is

1448
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,680
not resistant to global passive

1449
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,040
adversary

1450
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,960
uh you know zuko an electric coin

1451
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,319
company's been really friendly

1452
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,079
the zcash foundation has been i would

1453
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,440
say exceptionally

1454
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,400
unfriendly um you know so we're trying

1455
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,000
to be open to everybody

1456
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
uh that being said we will work with the

1457
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,599
people who choose to work with us and we

1458
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,400
will deliver

1459
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,800
code what those people first and if

1460
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,079
other people come on later that's okay

1461
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,559
thank you very much harry it was great

1462
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:21,760
thank you

1463
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,839
you
