1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,120
and

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,719
today i would like to show you my idea

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,040
of a better future and how we can reach

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,639
it and because i'm

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,720
a scientist i would like to do it a bit

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,080
evidence based

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
but because i also like polemics it will

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,080
be a bit polemic here and there

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,680
so and yeah so smart villages or smart

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,320
cities

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,160
for me like there's only one option of

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,240
these two and i think in the end

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,880
we will maybe share it or not so let's

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,760
see

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,200
so i started on this journey

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
by observing like this fact here so

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,800
we're discussing a lot about

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,079
animals and when i'm asking people what

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,239
do chickens actually prefer

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,200
most people would agree hey of course

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
you're on the bottom left chickens are

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,760
free to roam around

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,239
they can eat where they want they can

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,360
meet other chickens

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,120
they can sleep so they're not forced to

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,000
anything and

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
yeah but actually i'm coming from zurich

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,159
so it's

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,159
said to be one of the most livable

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,200
cities in the world

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,320
so always behind austria or in front of

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,360
austria so it's

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
kind of a place people want to be but

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,280
for me when i bike through the city it

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,119
often seems very similar

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,159
to this chicken factory so it doesn't

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,840
depend so like even the older structures

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,200
so these new buildings

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,040
they look pretty much the same and i'm

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,759
wondering where are humans actually

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,759
more happy so of course in the first

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,880
glance it doesn't

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,520
seem like but for chickens we know it

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,600
for humans we don't know it i feel

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,680
also most humans would like to live here

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,880
on the left

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,159
but also science is telling us actually

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,720
that

50
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,000
humans in nature they have

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,320
less depression they're more happy they

52
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,479
have a higher life satisfaction

53
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,640
they live in sustainable life they

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
the cognitive performance is increased

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,920
so there are a lot of

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,600
beneficial things happening in nature

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,759
and putting this

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,520
forward so like this comparison between

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,878
cities and villages

60
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,200
there actually many more of these

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,959
categories where villages

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,239
out compete cities so in the case of

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,680
health you have less

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,760
asthmatic diseases less allergies also

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
respiratory diseases i think it's kind

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,120
of a thing right now

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
so like in extreme villages you are far

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,680
better off you're also not so lonely

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,160
so you have stronger community with

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,440
other people

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,519
and um yeah autonomy usually people

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,160
own bigger properties they can grow

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,120
their own food

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,480
they have their own tools they can

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,040
construct things it's also something

76
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,000
james scott observed so in his book he

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,760
analyzed the cities in

78
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,920
upper south east asia and like how

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280
cities emerged there

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
it was always this thing that actually

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
centralized entities try to get as many

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
people around them

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,319
to better control them because you can

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,080
have the police close to you

85
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
and the military and they are also

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,120
easier to tax

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
so there's also thing if you don't like

88
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,159
taxes maybe

89
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,879
villages are preferable and because of

90
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,239
the great autonomy

91
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,560
also the consumption is much lower in

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,440
villages

93
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,040
so cities they rely a lot on the system

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,400
you have to get their food

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,440
to get things done and yeah

96
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,799
of course it's a bit of an unfair

97
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,879
comparison i could have chosen also

98
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,080
attributes where

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
cities probably out-compete villages so

100
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,360
all in all

101
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
i think one can say that cities

102
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,360
are more efficient than villages so if

103
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,239
you

104
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,159
find or you define a gold function

105
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,760
cities are very good at

106
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,239
optimizing it so we want cultural life

107
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,840
so we have a lot of cultural life we

108
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,200
want a high income

109
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,879
a lot of high income yeah so but they're

110
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,200
optimizing for this one thing usually

111
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,840
and not yeah accounting for these

112
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,280
externalities which are

113
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,239
basically not optimized for on the other

114
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,519
hand you have

115
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,000
they are more plentiful so maybe you

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,120
have

117
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
yeah a plumber is one village a plumber

118
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,799
in the other village so if an earthquake

119
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,760
happens

120
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,200
you still have a plumber in the other

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
village which could be exchanged so they

122
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,040
are

123
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,080
more resilient these villages but

124
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,639
in general not very efficient yeah so

125
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,600
it's

126
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,798
yeah this is what one can say but in the

127
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,199
end

128
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
it depends on us how we want to live we

129
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
want to live in a resilient

130
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,400
place or in a efficient place

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,840
and i think that currently

132
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,240
we have this trend that people are

133
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
moving to the cities

134
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
yeah so like the statistics telling us

135
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,560
that by 2050 i think 70 percent of the

136
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,840
world population

137
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,479
will live in cities and as far as i know

138
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,400
i know a lot of people who like

139
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
resilience so

140
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,880
i would guess it's a pretty high number

141
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
so what is the reason why is this life

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,960
concentrating right now in cities and i

143
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,040
identified where we basically identified

144
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,479
these two

145
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,360
mechanisms which are our answers to

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,039
these two questions which basically

147
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,639
manifest

148
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,919
this structure so one is like who can

149
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,400
know

150
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,639
what is the goal so what do we want to

151
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,759
optimize what

152
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,000
we want to strive for in the society and

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,800
the second is

154
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
when we identify this goal how do we

155
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,080
implement it

156
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,199
how to how do we reach it and

157
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,600
in my opinion there are two old beliefs

158
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,479
which basically

159
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,479
manifest the structure of the city and i

160
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,080
want to briefly explore them

161
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,160
with you so who can know

162
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
actually we heard it today back in the

163
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
days it was the church

164
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,720
so the church had the holy book and they

165
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
had a dire connection to god

166
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,919
and they basically knew what is right

167
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,759
and wrong whom i can love

168
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,080
whom i can't love yeah this got replaced

169
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,280
like yeah some some hundred years ago by

170
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,919
the state

171
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,160
so now the state has a holy book which

172
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
they call law book and they have all

173
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,039
these public servants

174
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,440
working on it the ministers and writing

175
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,960
into this book and basically

176
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
knowing what is the good consumption

177
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,080
what is a bad consumption

178
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,400
yeah so alcohol is okay for a healthy

179
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,360
society

180
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,720
and the other thing not and recently

181
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
this gets more and more replaced by

182
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,240
corporations so now they have

183
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
programmers they're writing the holy

184
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
code and

185
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,919
they are they seem to have the knowledge

186
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,360
about what i can say

187
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,680
and what i can't say yeah so what is

188
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
free speech what is hate speech

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
so basically i can't know it and

190
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,280
i basically edit it like recently this

191
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,240
one i can

192
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,080
i have the feeling i i don't know how to

193
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
fit it um

194
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
correctly into this graphic maybe it's

195
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,759
like kind of a merger of the previous

196
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,199
three things but kind of now yeah you

197
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,120
probably have to have a phd degree and

198
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,039
be a professor own a lot of money and

199
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:49,840
then you are

200
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,759
basically eligible to define what is

201
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,440
the right thing to do and what is common

202
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,880
to all of these developments is that

203
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,039
you always have a centralized entity

204
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,400
knowing what is

205
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,639
correct and it's not you yeah it's

206
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,319
someone else lying outside

207
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,440
telling you what is right and out of

208
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:11,840
this

209
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,039
a lot of suffering can follow

210
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,000
yeah so on the individual level where

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,880
people could not

212
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,240
be together there was a person they

213
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
laughed but also in the society level so

214
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,319
like in the us currently the one

215
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,080
drugs led to the one of the biggest

216
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,319
prison prison populations on earth

217
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,120
so they also societal problems connected

218
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
with these

219
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,160
normative decisions but let's assume

220
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,479
we go step back we know what we want to

221
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,160
reach here so we know

222
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,240
hey we want to go there how is our

223
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,160
society currently implementing

224
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
these things yeah and what we do we have

225
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,479
these hierarchical organizations we do

226
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,520
it by hierarchy

227
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,039
and basically everything is organized

228
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,800
like this our states

229
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,160
our cities our companies but also our

230
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,039
ngos

231
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,400
like name it's greenpeace wwf

232
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,840
all of them they function like this but

233
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,039
the problem with these hierarchical

234
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,240
structures is that the

235
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
quality of management decisions are

236
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,280
actually

237
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,080
pretty poor because they don't obtain

238
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,599
the real feedback from the ground

239
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,000
because of the power structure and like

240
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,639
fear

241
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,120
and other reasons biases self-selection

242
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,879
biases

243
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,479
the real state of the world is not

244
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,080
traveling upwards

245
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,319
and this can lead to problems so for

246
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,759
example in germany

247
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,879
the german government decided that hey

248
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,599
we know that we want to save the nature

249
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,919
and the only way to go forward is to

250
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,080
spare co2 so like all the researchers

251
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,679
everyone is saying this so this is kind

252
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,159
of

253
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,519
we agreed as a society to do and now

254
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,599
how do we reach it reducing co2 and what

255
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,560
they did actually

256
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,519
they introduced biofuel so you have fuel

257
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,000
now

258
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,720
where you put like plant like yeah fuel

259
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,399
from plants inside like five to ten

260
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,200
percent

261
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,680
and they subsidized the planting of bio

262
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,279
crops in germany

263
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,360
and the result was actually as a german

264
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
newspaper titled

265
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
we're now putting the rainforest into

266
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,000
our cars yeah so

267
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,680
because what happened german farmers

268
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,320
stop planting animal feeds

269
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,839
somewhere else these animal fields had

270
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,080
to be planted so it was shifted to south

271
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,880
america

272
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,160
and led to the destruction of the

273
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,320
rainforest there so kind of

274
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
even when we know hey we want to reduce

275
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,320
co2

276
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,760
the way how we're doing it often

277
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,640
seems not to work

278
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,680
so and here we have these two problems

279
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,320
so first is a normative problem

280
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,640
who can decide what is the good thing

281
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
the goal you want to optimize

282
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,760
and then it's like kind of a control

283
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,680
problem how do we establish

284
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,720
this thing yeah and as a researcher now

285
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,440
what you do

286
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
you go a step backwards like you try to

287
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,959
describe the problem

288
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,640
and then maybe find a solution this is

289
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,800
what i want to do now with you

290
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,680
so basically stepping a step backwards

291
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
how we can describe

292
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
our world is basically we can describe

293
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,279
it describe it as a complex system

294
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,440
so these complex systems can be

295
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,959
understood as a network

296
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,160
of networks yeah so and basically they

297
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,959
are characterized by the fact that

298
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,920
not the individual actors the notes in

299
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,440
this image are important

300
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,000
but more the connections links between

301
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
the notes these are the important thing

302
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,640
so in other words a complex system is

303
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
more than the sum of its parts

304
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,000
yeah and this has consequences

305
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
so and one of them is that

306
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,320
it often behaves very unintuitively

307
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
so like cause and effect doesn't hold

308
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,360
like in

309
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
like how i would experience it here if i

310
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,959
drop this i hear sound

311
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,279
basically what happens is that small

312
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,600
changes can have some cascading

313
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,120
effects like huge effects and sometimes

314
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,160
huge inputs change nothing this is also

315
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,360
sometimes known as a

316
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,839
butterfly effect so a swap of a

317
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,079
butterfly here can lead to a tornado

318
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,440
on the other side of the world so and

319
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
what does this actually mean for us

320
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,160
it means that no one can really know

321
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
[Music]

322
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
how things will be in the future yeah so

323
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,839
how to reach like or what should be a

324
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,640
state

325
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
because like the importance does not lie

326
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,920
in the nodes

327
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,760
so you can't have a supercomputer you

328
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
can't have a single

329
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,720
human being or a group of people and

330
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,240
even if we would know it through these

331
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,079
cascading failures we would not

332
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,160
know how to reach the state without

333
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,600
destroying the rainforest

334
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,839
or something like this and this i really

335
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,399
want to emphasize like a complex system

336
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,800
cannot be steered like a car or

337
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,720
controlled like a coffee machine

338
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,480
yeah and the thing is like every day

339
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
we're adding links to this network so

340
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,399
the complexity is basically growing

341
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,720
it's like a combinatorial growth not

342
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,160
just exponential so i think

343
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,600
exponentially

344
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,519
nowadays many people know so it's even

345
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,040
quicker than this

346
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,680
and yeah this basically leads us to

347
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,160
these

348
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,920
problems which we're seeing and these

349
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,600
old beliefs how

350
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,639
society can be structured are kind of

351
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,440
coming to an end and the question is can

352
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,279
we replace it or is there an answer as a

353
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,440
solution can we do something else

354
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,240
and here i have a good message yes they

355
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,120
are

356
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,880
so who can actually decide

357
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,279
what we should reach what is the goal

358
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,839
where we want to go

359
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
and the question is all of us together

360
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,760
somehow yeah so it's like there's this

361
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,920
phenomenon which basically justifies the

362
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,560
statement

363
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,880
which is called wisdom of the crowds was

364
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
first observed on an ox

365
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,760
auction so basically cow auction in

366
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,880
england where people were asked to to

367
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,839
guess the weight

368
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,880
of these orcs yeah of these cows here

369
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,360
and they would have gotten a price if

370
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,240
they

371
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,399
guessed the weight correctly and none of

372
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
them actually guessed the waves

373
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,079
but the mathematician came around and he

374
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,000
averaged all the guesses

375
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
and it was actually almost exactly the

376
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,440
weight of the cow i think just some

377
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,320
decimals

378
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,800
were wrong and this is actually

379
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
phenomenal which can be repeated

380
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,320
yeah so you can repeat this with your

381
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,720
children maybe in a birthday or like

382
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,760
like something like this

383
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,839
and there's also a nice bbc video one

384
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,120
can check it out so

385
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
this wisdom of the crowd is something

386
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
which can be observed and now the

387
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,639
question can we actually use this

388
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,639
for our society for our human world for

389
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,079
our complex world not just in these

390
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,200
small incidents

391
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
and there's this experiment like this

392
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
good judgment project where actually

393
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,720
average citizens are asked

394
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,440
about the future state of the world yeah

395
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,800
so

396
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,360
when will north korea launch the next

397
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,320
rocket

398
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,120
how will the refugee streams develop

399
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
what will happen in belarus so like

400
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,160
these kind of questions

401
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,079
but they actually found out that the

402
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,079
crowd is performing

403
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,480
more or less as well as the ca analyst

404
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,839
or sometimes even better

405
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,839
even they don't have access to this

406
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,680
classified information

407
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,959
so something to build on i would say so

408
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
we're pretty good in knowing what will

409
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
happen even

410
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
if the knowledge does not lie in a

411
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,240
single one of us it can emerge

412
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,399
out of our interactions i would say this

413
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,880
is also something what makes our

414
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
not maybe democracy but our pluralistic

415
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,320
society kind of strong

416
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,079
yeah so like these collective

417
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,240
intelligence

418
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
so how does it work very simple there's

419
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,959
three principles one has to follow

420
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,440
one has to guarantee free access to

421
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
information so everyone should access

422
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,120
information freely

423
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,920
we need privacy to reason about it to

424
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,519
interact with our neighbors to think

425
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,680
about it to also make mistakes

426
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,720
and then to have freedom of speech and

427
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,959
letting the information out again

428
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,079
so if this is enabled basically this

429
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,760
wisdom of the crowds

430
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,040
can function and if one tries

431
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,399
now to spoil some of these steps

432
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,320
then the crowd can also be led to a

433
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,680
wrong direction that's something one

434
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,399
needs to

435
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,079
take care of so wisdom of the crowds

436
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,600
does not always

437
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,160
work but if we set up the mechanisms

438
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,639
wide

439
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,120
it can

440
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,959
so now we have this yeah

441
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,560
basically now we know how we can

442
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,680
uh we know who can decide so it's us so

443
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,800
basically how

444
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,440
can we implement these things our

445
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,480
society

446
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,240
yeah and if we look to nature we see

447
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,120
many of such phenomenon like basically

448
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,920
self

449
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,399
organizing systems bottom up so this is

450
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,600
a flock of birds

451
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,759
which is very interesting because it has

452
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,600
very good properties for the birds

453
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,519
inside of this flock yeah you have a

454
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,519
good protection against enemies you very

455
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,120
easily identify

456
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,920
food resources around but maybe because

457
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,320
of this

458
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,399
no one is forced to join this flock of

459
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,320
birds yeah so all these birds

460
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,600
are voluntarily inside of this flock

461
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,279
and the most interesting thing is

462
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,440
there's no controlling birds inside

463
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,759
yeah no bird controlling where it should

464
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,839
go it's a very simple

465
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,240
interaction mechanism in place yeah so

466
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,160
if i'm too close to another bird i fly

467
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,720
away

468
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,440
if i'm too far away i fly back again

469
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,399
very simple

470
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,240
feedback and the system moves forward

471
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,000
and what is interesting like this is

472
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,839
very resilient

473
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,839
yeah so if a hunter comes around and

474
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,000
tries to kill the controlling bird

475
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,519
it's not possible because it doesn't

476
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,519
exist so it's

477
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,120
that's and if we go a step further

478
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,880
basically safe organizing systems are

479
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,199
everywhere so our human body

480
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,680
is such kind of a system so it's not the

481
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,240
brain

482
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
controlling everything it's also we have

483
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,440
our immune system

484
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,040
which is pretty strong totally

485
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,639
decentralized you have all these

486
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,320
different nutritions in your body which

487
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
give feedback to different organs and

488
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
going back and forward and like having

489
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,360
there

490
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,800
something controlling would probably

491
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,959
just mess around with everything

492
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,160
so this is like nature can we also

493
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,600
take this to our society

494
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,560
and they actually has been richer a

495
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,880
research in traffic jams in cities

496
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,839
yeah so how usually traffic is managed

497
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,520
in cities you have a centralized

498
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,559
authority

499
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,760
and they plan how traffic lightning

500
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,520
will be in the city so in the morning

501
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,959
you have a green wave here

502
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,640
in the evening you have it there after

503
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
football matches you have a different

504
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,439
plan and it often ends up in traffic

505
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,240
jams

506
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,119
and what researchers have been doing is

507
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,679
actually

508
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,000
they designed a system and they tested

509
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,799
it in dresden

510
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,400
and now they're selling it so but it's

511
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,000
very very hard to

512
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,039
get this sold as i heard

513
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,120
but the thing is what they did actually

514
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,000
they let every traffic light on its own

515
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,280
decide how to optimize the flow locally

516
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,919
just by communicating with neighboring

517
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,120
traffic lights

518
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,000
yeah so basically there was

519
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
communication on the bottom level but

520
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
no traffic light had the overview of the

521
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,600
whole

522
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,120
system state and by following this very

523
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,160
simple

524
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,400
principle actually the average waiting

525
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,760
time for all

526
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,640
of these traffic participants got

527
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,760
reduced

528
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,960
so that's something

529
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,840
very nice and how does it work again

530
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,000
it's actually simpler than before

531
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,120
so we are humans we are acting even if

532
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,480
you sleep or you just sit

533
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,960
you're doing an action so it's all kind

534
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,400
of in behavior

535
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,320
this has an effect on our environment

536
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,039
this environment changes and ideally

537
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
gives us feedback back

538
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,039
but if we don't get this feedback for

539
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,000
example

540
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,080
because like the rainforest is too far

541
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,640
away or we don't see the consequences of

542
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,000
old people in isolation

543
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,880
or something like this we are not able

544
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,760
to change

545
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,520
our behavior but this is actually

546
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,080
important for self-organization so that

547
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,000
people can locally change and adjust the

548
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,200
behavior

549
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,640
okay so actually

550
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,799
perfect so now we are basically here

551
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,360
i kind of i would say at the crossroads

552
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,880
but i think it's nothing

553
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
very new so we have always been there so

554
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,720
always

555
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,240
as we heard like just in the previous

556
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,320
talk there were always new technologies

557
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,559
coming joining so people always had to

558
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,440
decide

559
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,640
how to use technology to

560
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,400
proceed forward and i think the one way

561
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,840
how technology actually can be used is

562
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,880
to make these very efficient systems

563
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,120
more resilient which would lead into

564
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,880
smart cities

565
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,520
and the other way would be make these

566
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,640
very resilient

567
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,120
structures more efficient so it's

568
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,880
something what we could do

569
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,919
and what do i mean with it so actually

570
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,760
what we're doing right now

571
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,440
which is my observation is like we're

572
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,679
using all this computational power all

573
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,440
these technology which we're having

574
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
to kind of collect data to gaza and gaza

575
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,120
more of it

576
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,520
to better predict the future to make

577
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,320
this machine

578
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,799
learning and statistical analysis just

579
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,799
to know how the future could look like

580
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,679
and then to be in the position to force

581
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,080
people

582
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,720
to behave somehow to reach there or to

583
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,000
come to a different

584
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,880
state like we have to save two two

585
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,720
degrees it can't not gets

586
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,080
warmer than this and uh yeah so these

587
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,480
are like

588
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,919
these general statements and how do we

589
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,760
do it how do we implement them by

590
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,640
surveillance

591
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,480
yeah so we are observing people how they

592
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,000
behave if they do something wrong they

593
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,280
get punished

594
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,000
and we have these corona apps now also

595
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,600
tracking people

596
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,039
yeah that's the one way to go forward

597
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,000
but actually the other way forward could

598
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,280
also be hey

599
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,080
we're also already having some resilient

600
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,520
structures yeah so we're having these

601
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,799
networks of people

602
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,440
we are here network the geographical

603
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,720
networks like people

604
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,200
are already organized they're kind of

605
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,280
resilient yes they're not depending too

606
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,559
much on the system

607
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,480
and how can we actually make these

608
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,679
structures

609
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,559
more efficient and i think i don't need

610
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,320
to talk too much about

611
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,080
this slide i think most of you are

612
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,919
probably more knowledgeable

613
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,600
than me and all these technologies which

614
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,919
are out there you could use 3d printing

615
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,520
you could rethink money

616
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
have a real truly democratized or

617
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
decentralized money

618
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,240
we can do home office yeah so we can be

619
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,360
in nature

620
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,520
and outside for those who are able to do

621
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,760
it we can meet with people together

622
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,919
we can form these communal places of

623
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,360
interactions like here

624
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,960
which i think is very important also for

625
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,559
this wisdom of the crowd to

626
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,799
emerge in the end and i'm pretty sure

627
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,840
there are also many

628
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,600
non-digital solutions like permaculture

629
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,880
or like these kind of things so the

630
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
question is really

631
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,799
where do we use technology and why not

632
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,000
but if we use it

633
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,679
i would say we should rather go forward

634
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,880
to this solution and yeah

635
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,400
so maybe coming briefly to an end

636
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,159
how i see it it's

637
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,919
so basically this knowledge of these

638
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,280
complex systems

639
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,919
and these self-organizing systems yeah

640
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,000
and this wisdom of the crowd phenomenon

641
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,799
inside of it it's basically kind of like

642
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,000
a way

643
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
of life like something hopeful for me

644
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
but also an obligation

645
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,960
so i think it's very hopeful because we

646
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,760
know

647
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,159
that in the end it depends on us yeah so

648
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,640
even if i do just something very minor

649
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,320
giving here a speech or not even maybe

650
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,919
just being present here

651
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,480
already can have an effect yeah so

652
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,159
cascading is like really it's not

653
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,200
obvious and it has an effect yeah so

654
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,320
that's one thing

655
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,440
and all of us are really important in

656
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,960
forming this goal where we want to reach

657
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
yes so every single one of us

658
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,880
if we are small or tall old and young

659
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,799
sick or healthy it doesn't really matter

660
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,240
it's like all kind of

661
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,520
part of it but i think out of this

662
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,280
also comes this obligation yeah so we

663
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,039
have this responsibility to do these

664
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,120
things to go out to do stuff

665
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,520
really manifesting the reality we want

666
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
to see

667
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,919
in this world and hence i yeah

668
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,320
see it a bit like probably manuel kant

669
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,880
so we always have the

670
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
possibility to emerge out of this

671
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
self-imposed immaturity

672
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,880
and in the end to really decide if we

673
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,200
want to be chicken in a factory

674
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,320
or free human beings like

675
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,720
incorporating like or engaging with our

676
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,520
neighbors

677
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,440
and i think in the end it's up to you up

678
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,200
to me up to all of us

679
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,840
and yeah with this i want to close thank

680
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,220
you very much

681
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:45,979
[Applause]

682
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,240
thank you very it's time much

683
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,880
questions

684
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,399
so who has the first one

685
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,880
uh hello uh i uh when you were talking

686
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,840
about the

687
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,320
wisdom of the crowds or the collective

688
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,679
intelligence

689
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,200
i think it's a very uh it can be used

690
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,600
to assess the truth and maybe even to

691
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,200
predict the future

692
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,080
but how do you think that we can avoid

693
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,559
it from making choices for us

694
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,039
because uh there will be many outliers

695
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,320
and people

696
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,200
whose choices will not align with what

697
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,760
the

698
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,960
this wisdom of the crowd decides

699
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,000
yeah i i totally agree so uh

700
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,440
there's other on many levels but i think

701
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,279
the simplest one is like

702
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,600
it's one step deciding what we want to

703
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,240
have but i think this self organization

704
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
like is the next step so no one should

705
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,159
be forced to be part of this flock of

706
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:50,720
birds

707
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,200
yeah so and i think even those with

708
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,720
extreme opinions or like

709
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,760
outliers the kind of part of this goal

710
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,279
function even if in the end they are not

711
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,039
subscribing to it yes they should have

712
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,799
the freedom to step out of it because

713
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,120
in the end how self-organization works

714
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,320
of course

715
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,640
there is a danger in the end that you

716
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,400
say hey we have this cool tool

717
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,640
we're all participating in it it tells

718
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,720
us we should not go outside anymore

719
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,400
and then you're forced to do it this is

720
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,799
of course again something very dystopian

721
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,760
i i would say but it's a principle a

722
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
mechanism which in combination with

723
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,640
others

724
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,919
can can work yeah but also what i

725
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,039
mentioned is like

726
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,200
it can really be misused so if you have

727
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
no privacy or you have no

728
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,960
so for example in this example with the

729
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,200
cows now like we're guessing so like you

730
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,799
need to have a free

731
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,120
access to information if you if you

732
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,000
would restrict

733
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,080
half of them half of the people maybe

734
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,919
even biased people maybe just the

735
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,000
smaller ones not to go to the cow to see

736
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,799
it

737
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,000
then they would lack this piece of

738
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,080
information and probably then

739
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,320
like this wisdom of the crowd would be

740
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,240
disturbed and um

741
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,600
come to problems but i'm not too sure i

742
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,159
i yeah this would need to be checked i

743
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,120
think that probably there are some

744
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,159
studies but

745
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,600
yeah these are the principles which

746
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
needs to be fulfilled and

747
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,039
i'm pretty sure that right now most of

748
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,840
them are not fulfilled

749
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,880
other questions

750
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,120
maybe i'll ask for one

751
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,200
how do you perceive the trends in the

752
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,559
world right now like

753
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,880
uh regarding what you were talking about

754
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,000
let's say

755
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,039
general so what is the practice or maybe

756
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,360
if you can give some examples what's

757
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,039
going on yeah

758
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,200
it's a good question um i i think

759
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,039
the biggest problem i think right now is

760
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,279
like these freedom of expression

761
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,440
and like having like opposing opinions

762
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
like also an academic context like this

763
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,400
that's a

764
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,679
kind of problematic i think also like

765
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,039
how academia is working

766
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,039
and forming these opinions like also in

767
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,960
context with this technocracy

768
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,279
where like i'm kind of observing that

769
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,120
only experts are allowed

770
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,240
to voice an opinion are valuable but not

771
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,640
all the others so out of this

772
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,840
perspective

773
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,760
yeah i think they feel like the freedom

774
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,039
of expression and

775
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,640
following from this the free access to

776
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,120
information is lacking and many people

777
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,520
are

778
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,559
yeah probably misled it but i i yeah i

779
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,840
don't know that's my

780
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,440
my take on it i see so um and um

781
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,240
do you have any idea how for example to

782
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,880
fix it

783
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,600
like what would be the way out from yeah

784
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:31,919
yeah

785
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,760
so i i think the way out is like really

786
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,440
through this self-organization

787
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,799
by doing small steps as i see it

788
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,640
like you know like everyone can start

789
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,840
changing things

790
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,919
locally and this can have bigger effects

791
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,960
and it's like a very pragmatic way

792
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,279
forward i don't see it really changing

793
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,600
quickly from top or from somewhere else

794
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,399
i think

795
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,279
yeah we need to really do it like even

796
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,799
by such events like here

797
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,360
like meeting physically talking

798
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,080
expression

799
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,600
expressing ideas yeah

800
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,880
okay maybe i was also wondering like

801
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,919
maybe in switzerland for example or

802
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,200
also the university environment if

803
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,320
there you can see any trends for self

804
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,200
organization kind of modern trends of

805
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
course that there is some level of

806
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,480
organization and

807
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,399
autonomy inside of academia yeah

808
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,320
i think it's like also a very strict

809
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,520
hierarchical system

810
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,080
in the end like you have like yeah

811
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,960
professors

812
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,840
which uh like kind of yeah everyone

813
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,279
wants to reach this position

814
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,120
inside of academia so until you're not a

815
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
professor you're not very free

816
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,840
until when you have reached it you have

817
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,600
other pressures like publishing

818
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,399
like these things and one can go here

819
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,600
into details like

820
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,799
how publishing works but in the end

821
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,840
you cannot very step very far outside of

822
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,279
what is

823
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,120
believed currently so like it's always

824
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,399
very minor steps

825
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,960
and kind of keeping people together like

826
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,000
around an idea

827
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,480
yeah so is another way to say

828
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,520
do some activities that can have impact

829
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,880
outside of the academic structures this

830
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,799
i so yeah we're trying sometimes

831
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,960
so and i think it's really because like

832
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,799
i think what many people carry

833
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,320
with themselves is this belief that it

834
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
has to be like it is or what

835
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,559
the speaker before says it's that kind

836
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,559
of it's a paradigm it's always like how

837
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:34,880
it

838
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,600
is but we have very good reasons to

839
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,760
think that actually self-organization

840
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,159
is much much much more efficient and

841
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,559
maybe also more aligned with our values

842
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,320
than what we're doing right now with

843
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,559
this centralized control system

844
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,760
and there's research about it so their

845
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,960
papers studies

846
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,000
like simulations experiments so yeah

847
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,720
it's like one way to see the world and

848
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,799
yeah in the end i think it's a normative

849
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,679
decision

850
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,520
what how we want to use it because i

851
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,799
think you can also make the case and

852
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,159
saying hey we have these efficient

853
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,600
structures we just make them more

854
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,240
resilient

855
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,640
and that's basically the mainstream most

856
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,440
academia

857
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,240
so big data analysis machine learning

858
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,679
all of these things

859
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,720
and i think most people are not aware

860
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,159
that it's in the end the decision

861
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,679
what we want to have no

862
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,120
okay thank you so yeah another question

863
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,360
here

864
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,679
hi what do you think um please bear with

865
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,440
me because i feel this question is going

866
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,240
to take

867
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,159
forever to lay down because i have to go

868
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,520
through several things but i would

869
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,480
really like to

870
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,600
to get your feedback on this if we go

871
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,399
back

872
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,880
about 200 years the first industrial

873
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,600
revolution

874
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,320
and then to the second and now on into

875
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,840
the third industrial revolution what we

876
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,600
have is basically

877
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,679
once the general industry the the

878
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,120
general purpose

879
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,799
platform behind things the energy matrix

880
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,519
the the the sources of energy the

881
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,720
communication

882
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,960
basically uh systems around and the

883
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,919
logistics

884
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,200
every time that they change

885
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,360
significantly we have an industrial

886
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,480
revolution

887
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,559
there's sort of like a very big word

888
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,880
left unsaid when you explained uh when

889
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
you move from centralization to

890
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,559
decentralization which is capitalism

891
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,440
the inner logic of capitalism is

892
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,799
entrepreneurialism you have to compete

893
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,480
to achieve better prices for the

894
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
consumer you have to compete compete

895
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,880
i mean competition is something that you

896
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,440
you have to keep doing basically so

897
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,159
for some authors now we're entering into

898
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,519
a stage where

899
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,440
technology has gotten so better because

900
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,960
there is so much

901
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,360
uh so much investment in technology to

902
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,000
get more

903
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
competitive that we're approaching near

904
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,240
zero the near zero marginal cost society

905
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,279
basically authors would argue that this

906
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,559
uh approaches like get set uh get gets

907
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:56,960
us

908
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,159
um closer to a to a state where the

909
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,679
sharing economy and creating like um

910
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,799
not functioning around profit like

911
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,000
a future of profit being the fund not

912
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,200
going for profit

913
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,480
not existing to get our existence into

914
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,000
that into the market

915
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,360
but beyond right all of this is possible

916
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,240
because of

917
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,559
uh the kind of technologies you were you

918
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,440
were mentioning

919
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,080
3d printing the breaching the going from

920
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,000
the beats economy to the atoms

921
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,279
economy the central asian education uh

922
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,640
3d printing all of that um decentralized

923
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,080
and lateral scales

924
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,320
uh laterally scaled means of production

925
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,159
basically so what i would like to know

926
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,760
basically which is kind of like the the

927
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,480
uncomfortable

928
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,840
question to ask is how would you

929
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,120
conceive a society not based on the

930
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,840
market

931
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,360
but beyond the market right

932
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,399
based on the technologies um currently

933
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,919
um are they level right

934
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,080
yeah so it's a good i think in the end

935
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,679
the question

936
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,800
what is the market

937
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,600
[Music]

938
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,440
i have this one view i think as long as

939
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,240
it's physical you cannot overcome

940
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,840
shortage of resources of course in the

941
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,919
digital world you can have it

942
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,440
but not in the physical world so like

943
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
what you said like with these marginal

944
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,039
costs are getting lower and lower

945
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,679
i don't see it happening in the physical

946
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,159
world

947
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,360
probably but yeah overcoming

948
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,280
the markets like yeah i'm

949
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,360
[Music]

950
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:39,600
what is the market in the end yeah so

951
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,559
the difficult question so i i would say

952
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,200
in the end

953
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,960
you're not overcoming the market in the

954
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,000
sense that people

955
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,559
will always interact or talk with each

956
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,720
other and negotiate things or

957
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,600
live together but having this price tag

958
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,039
maybe out of the equation

959
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,519
this would be something i would like to

960
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,600
see so like maybe more doing it

961
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,200
unconditionally like yeah so actually

962
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,000
this is my my

963
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,399
research project about so like of course

964
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,119
one can

965
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,440
conceptualize all different types of

966
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,960
things and tokens

967
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,359
and then give it a number again but a

968
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,239
bit what i

969
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,960
saw happening is basically like 100

970
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,159
years ago

971
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,199
um most things didn't have a price tag

972
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,159
yeah so

973
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,119
the grandparents lived with with a

974
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,079
family at home

975
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,399
so there were no old people homes so

976
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,320
there was no one paid for this yeah

977
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,719
you had you helped neighbor when he was

978
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,320
sick like kind of maybe you cooked some

979
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,119
food

980
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,440
like many things were not monetized

981
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
yeah collaborative yeah so and this

982
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,800
monetization

983
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,520
went further and further so now we pay

984
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,199
for a lot of services which

985
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,040
back in the days there was no price tag

986
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,280
on top of them and what happens now in

987
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,918
this whole

988
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,200
tokenization space i see it a bit giving

989
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,280
price tags to things which don't have a

990
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
price tag right now

991
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,040
and by this i think your dystopian idea

992
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,359
probably is even right now more

993
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,040
encouraged that everything becomes a

994
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,760
market

995
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,480
in this sense that it gives profits and

996
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,040
in the end

997
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
like reducing to money again or like

998
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,359
this yeah so i think

999
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,880
yeah in the end i think people need to

1000
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,200
do more things unconditionally

1001
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,598
just doing it like and yeah but

1002
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,680
sorry for this microphone to hear it i'm

1003
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,200
just going to say that that example was

1004
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,640
when we lived in a much more nuclear

1005
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,320
society but now people are more spread

1006
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,920
out they travel more

1007
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,240
so that just kind of stopped working

1008
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,880
um what's the question no i'm just

1009
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,680
making a statement

1010
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,079
like that description was a long time

1011
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,040
ago

1012
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,440
when people didn't travel you know you

1013
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,560
lived in your village you

1014
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,000
you were born in your village and you

1015
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,920
died in your village so you had their

1016
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,119
relationship with your next

1017
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,320
neighbor you go and cook and they would

1018
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,560
look after you like symbiotic

1019
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,480
but today's society where you jump on my

1020
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,599
flight to london next week is six euros

1021
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,240
i mean that's it's more well it's almost

1022
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,200
like two coffees

1023
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,839
or a flight to london yeah so um we're a

1024
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,520
much more mobile society so we've lost

1025
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,880
this connection with

1026
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,320
our community yeah yeah so yeah

1027
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,560
i i agree so maybe we have to build

1028
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,920
community again

1029
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,960
or coming to a point that society is so

1030
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,560
nice that you can trust other people

1031
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,119
more

1032
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,000
but then how to reach there from now up

1033
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,040
to the future

1034
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,079
i don't know i just know if yeah i open

1035
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,040
up a bit more

1036
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,960
so maybe the other one tries to open up

1037
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
a bit more so

1038
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,800
but i think another part of the equation

1039
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,160
is people are well

1040
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,760
i think people are a lot more selfish

1041
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,119
today yeah so these are these

1042
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,079
maybe maybe so yeah so i think one can

1043
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:48,800
have this

1044
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,440
view on the world like everyone is

1045
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,200
selfish

1046
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,680
i would say of myself i'm not selfish

1047
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,320
probably

1048
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,839
you would also say you're not selfish so

1049
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,599
we're already two so like i think they

1050
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,000
are

1051
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,920
more and more people and i think the

1052
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,440
problem is we're the minority and most

1053
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,960
people are what's in it for me

1054
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,119
so yeah okay that's the thing so i i

1055
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,079
believe i

1056
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,119
i believe that 51 of the people are

1057
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,280
not selfish and if it's a slight

1058
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,040
majority

1059
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,800
yeah yeah yeah so we are two against two

1060
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,920
very honest i know we can yeah i don't

1061
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,599
know i think that's in the end

1062
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,040
the thing so i think if you believe

1063
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,560
other people are selfish then you would

1064
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,240
need all this control

1065
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,320
system in place yeah and if you think

1066
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,160
that majority is kind of

1067
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
like okay like to live with then you

1068
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,920
would not need all these controls around

1069
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,960
you

1070
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,040
yeah and say kind of what you believe in

1071
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,200
the end i guess

1072
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,400
okay one more question please

1073
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,119
over here in the front yeah

1074
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,760
so if we want to create a smart village

1075
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,560
uh

1076
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,280
what should we do what are the first

1077
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,800
technologies practices

1078
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,200
and values if we want to do what create

1079
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,400
a smart village

1080
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
mud village that's a good question you

1081
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,359
can start exploring

1082
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,800
i i it depends i just know

1083
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,280
the area i'm from like this so and i

1084
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,240
think

1085
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,280
getting at first things not like you

1086
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,160
know

1087
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,560
i think villagers are hated a lot out of

1088
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
good reasons like conservativism

1089
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
and some things never change and it's

1090
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,480
really hard if you're different

1091
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,000
but i think they're also mechanisms in

1092
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,920
place which are very nice like

1093
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,880
i know commun like uh once a year we

1094
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,599
have a party

1095
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,119
in the village where i'm from something

1096
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,599
like this so where all people meet

1097
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,720
young and old yeah so the manager

1098
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,960
up to the lowest worker so like having

1099
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,480
like these these

1100
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,000
mechanisms which are there like

1101
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,599
festivals like not

1102
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,359
not removing them i think that's the

1103
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,119
first step and

1104
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,880
having like this local participation so

1105
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,440
many people still engage on local level

1106
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,400
in the matters which are there so and

1107
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,079
and then trying to step by step

1108
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,359
to increase them like local autonomy and

1109
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,400
yeah it's like a bit i see it and for my

1110
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,599
case probably a space where people can

1111
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,599
meet like-minded people something like

1112
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,359
this here is probably

1113
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,160
always a good step well but if you

1114
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,280
already have this and

1115
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,200
i don't know then you have to see for

1116
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,640
the next step and

1117
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,800
maybe putting some ideas out or

1118
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,880
developing some tools or

1119
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,839
trying to talk with people i know

1120
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,750
[Music]

1121
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:40,499
[Applause]
