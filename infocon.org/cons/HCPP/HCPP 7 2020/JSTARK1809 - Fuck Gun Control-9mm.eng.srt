00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,800
okay guys the idea of freedom

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
of liberty of trying to be

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,200
free of not trying to be under tyranny

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,240
is not new many people have given their

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,680
lives for this kind of

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,880
kind of cause wars have been fought

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,519
countries have gone independent and such

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,039
a country is the united states of

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,480
america

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,039
there are fed up by the tourney of the

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:31,920
british

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,960
empire and they will

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,399
they went to war for for for freedom and

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,360
to

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,399
escape that tyranny and so

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,280
this kind of struggle is nothing new and

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,960
one of the first things that the british

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,760
actually did

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,360
or what actually caused the actual war

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,320
was when the british tried to take up

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,160
when the british tried to take the farms

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,680
from the americans so

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,760
british troops were sent to basically

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,640
a storage facility where arms were

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,680
stored

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,119
that were i think part are supposed to

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:09,680
be

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,119
for militia and as they

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,040
went to that storage american militiamen

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,880
basically tried to resist and try to

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
stop them from taking their farms and

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,640
that's actually how the

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,840
american war for independence actually

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,159
started so

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,600
the tyrant wants to take your firearms

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
and you don't want that to happen and

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,439
now war breaks out

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,920
and now nation gets created by this

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,560
notion

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,880
that you want to be independent that you

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
want to be your own

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,360
leader that you you want to have your

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,759
life in your control

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,560
and just to basically end this little

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,920
chapter here

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,880
and my humble opinion to protect all

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
your other rights such as freedom of

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,640
speech and so on and so forth

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,159
you need something to protect those

51
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,399
rights to make sure that nobody takes

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,000
these rights away

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,799
and to be able to do that you need

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,920
firearms

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
you need arms of some sort to be able to

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,758
put up resistance

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,280
and this is why in the united states

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
the second amendment so an amendment to

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,720
their

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,959
previous constitution was something that

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,840
is enshrined into the constitutional law

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,599
the second amendment says a

63
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,319
well-regulated militia

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,160
being necessary to the security of a

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,000
free straight free state

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
the right of the people to keep and bear

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,480
arms shall not be infringed

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,319
so they knew right from the start how

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,000
important is this to be able to have

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,760
arms so that you can defend yourselves

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
and that you can escape out of tyranny

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,800
by having

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
the means to defend yourself

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,040
and so this kind of idea

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,280
resonated with me i was always

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,879
interested in firearms

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,040
and i wanted to be not defenseless

78
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
and i i absolutely rejected the idea

79
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,560
that firearms should be regulated so

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,440
that civilians cannot own them

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
and one of the guys who thought in a

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,120
similar way

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
before me like i'm not the first guy is

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
pa luthi who was a british man

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,319
who basically developed a diy sub

86
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,239
machine gun in his jet

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,360
and he made it out of sheet metal and

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
hardware fasteners that you can get from

89
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,480
hardware stores and so on and so forth

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,519
and this was like

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,120
one of the major chapters in diy

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,879
firearms so this is nothing new

93
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,680
the issue with this is though that to

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,640
build a

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,959
diy submachine gun out of metal the way

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,920
luthi did it

97
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,879
it's very complicated complicated for an

98
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,840
average guy

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,239
so if you never had any metal files in

100
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,840
your hands meaning

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,760
that those basic tools to to work with

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
metal if you've never

103
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
had a like workshop class or something

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,879
like that if you and

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,439
if you in general are not do that for a

106
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,040
living like a job like machinist or

107
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,920
something

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,519
it's very difficult for you to to gain

109
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,519
the skills to be able to make a reliable

110
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,720
sub machine gun

111
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,519
the way luthi presented it so basically

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,159
you'd need

113
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,840
multiple months or even years of

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,200
experience to be able to

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,880
gain the skills to be able to produce a

116
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,120
reliable submachine gun

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,160
in this traditional way but now there's

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,199
a new technology

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,680
it's called fdm fusing the position

120
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,800
model modeling

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,040
so basically what you're doing is you're

122
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,880
taking plastic

123
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,720
and you've got gears that pull the

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,400
plastic filament so it's a string of

125
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,680
plastic

126
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,560
through a device and this device heats

127
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
up this plastic

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
and it pushes it pushes it through a

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,120
nozzle

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,639
a nozzle is basically this little device

131
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,479
which has a hole in here and so it

132
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,680
presses the

133
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,000
the the filament that was now melted

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,360
here by a hot end

135
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
and presses it out like like uh what do

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
you call like that cream you put on a

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,080
little

138
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,880
on a pie or something on a cake and you

139
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,199
so

140
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,440
it presses out of the nozzle and this

141
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,240
nozzle

142
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
moves to the left to the right fourth

143
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,759
and backwards and then

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,600
starts from the bottom and it builds

145
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,880
this kind of cake

146
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,199
this kind of geometry where you've got

147
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,639
layer for layer for layer and this is

148
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:12,960
how

149
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,080
3d printing technology works and this

150
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,720
has become

151
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,680
cheap only very recently many years ago

152
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,560
it cost

153
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,080
multiple thousands of dollars to have a

154
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,360
machine that was able to use this

155
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,520
technology

156
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,639
now the first big thing that went around

157
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,639
the world as the news

158
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,960
a 3d printed firearm a firearm that was

159
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,639
made with this technology

160
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,479
where you can just push a button and

161
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,960
come out comes out of the firearm

162
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,919
that was in 2013 deliberator presented

163
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,000
by cody wilson who had actually an

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,120
engineer working from

165
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
who actually did most of the designing

166
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
in the liberator he merely

167
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,919
basically presented it and was the

168
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,840
figurehead of his company that he

169
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,280
founded defense distributed

170
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,600
and so in 2013 this news went around the

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,479
world

172
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,960
what you have to realize is this is

173
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,880
almost completely printed firearm

174
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
3d printed file meaning you just

175
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,080
basically

176
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,479
push a button on a machine and outcomes

177
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,360
come these

178
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
printed parts now of course there's

179
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,240
still a steel nail that you need because

180
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,639
it doesn't work doesn't work completely

181
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,280
without

182
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
without steel you're like you need some

183
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,440
metal in your farm to make work

184
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,919
more explain on that later what i have

185
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,680
to realize is basically this is a

186
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,520
firearm you put one cartridge in

187
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,199
you shoot and then you have to take the

188
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,120
gun apart and put another cartridge in

189
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,880
and the other issue is since this is

190
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,639
basically almost all of the other metal

191
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,880
and the barrel especially it's not

192
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,600
really usable for multiple shots

193
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
even if you're able to to build it in

194
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,199
such a way where it doesn't break

195
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,240
after the first shot and it's only

196
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,639
380 acp so it's it's kind of potent but

197
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,199
it's not really that cool to to have

198
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,120
just a 380 acp gun you want a nine

199
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,160
millimeter gun right

200
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
but this wouldn't work with a nine

201
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,560
millimeter gun since the pressures are

202
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,840
much higher but i will speak

203
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,639
later on so this was basically the first

204
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,479
3d printed farm around the world

205
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,479
and basically the first option for

206
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,680
people

207
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,599
who for example live in europe and

208
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,880
firearms are restricted

209
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,199
and now they can 3d print their firearm

210
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,400
at that time

211
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
even if you would be happy with a

212
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
liberator it was still kind of

213
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,199
impossible because

214
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,960
the 3d printers were extremely expensive

215
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
at the time and it was basically one

216
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,080
shot

217
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,639
and so this is kind of how it works so

218
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,000
the atf the

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,080
american agency for abaco iveco

220
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,240
i mean alcohol tobacco on farms they

221
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,960
basically demonstrated that it works

222
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
when you print it right with the

223
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
expensive 3d printing tools but as you

224
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,599
see

225
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
you've got the trigger pull the hammer

226
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
strikes and then you've got the shot but

227
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,080
that's only one

228
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,520
shot so what you have to realize is

229
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,720
the fire a firearm how it works so with

230
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
farms you've got a cartridge

231
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,319
this this is a cartridge and then you've

232
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,479
got a bolt or a breech of some sort that

233
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,680
is basically

234
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,919
pushing from behind the cartridge to

235
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,919
make sure it stays in place

236
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
and this cartridge sits inside of a

237
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,080
barrel so it's look like a little pocket

238
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,280
inside of this barrel

239
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,520
and this barrel is there to guide this

240
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,879
little thing here which is called a

241
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,520
bullet

242
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,000
guided and then this bullet comes out of

243
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,280
the barrel

244
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
and so you all get got three components

245
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,560
the cartridge basically

246
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,879
some kind of thing that pushes on on

247
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,319
this back of this cartridge

248
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,160
and then the barrel something the bullet

249
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
travels through

250
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,800
and the issue is when a cartridge fires

251
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
the pressures that i play here are so

252
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,280
high

253
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,279
that you cannot afford to have this

254
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,958
piece here the breech or the bolt or

255
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,159
whatever it is on the back

256
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,559
can afford to to to be out of plastic

257
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,399
has to be out of metal and the

258
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,760
thing that the bullet travels through

259
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,519
has to be and the cartridge sits inside

260
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,720
has to be out of metal too

261
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,959
because the physics are just that way so

262
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
plastic won't work for that

263
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,279
if you have opposing cartridge like nine

264
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,320
millimeter and up

265
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,279
or if you want to shoot multiple

266
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,080
multiple rounds without it exploding

267
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
if you just want a one shot this works

268
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,279
with 380 acp

269
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,959
but if you want something more potent if

270
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,320
you want something that is just more

271
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
than one shot

272
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,880
it's not just basically a toy but an

273
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
actual working firearm it needs

274
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,000
to be out of metal and then another

275
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,680
component that you have to talk about

276
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
is the thing on the frontier of the

277
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
barrel this which you can kind of make

278
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,920
out

279
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,720
which is called rifling so during the

280
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,279
days

281
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,680
of the american revolutionary war you

282
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,279
had little

283
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,680
balls of lead that you shot and you

284
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
could only shoot like an in

285
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
close distance of like i don't know a

286
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,839
couple of couple of tens of meter meters

287
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,880
for example

288
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,519
but with rifling you can you're able to

289
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,200
shoot a distance of like 50 meters

290
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
accurately

291
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
without this you're not accurate at 50

292
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,040
meters you only act

293
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
you could only like hit effectively at

294
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,480
10 meters but the issue is this is not

295
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,519
really effective

296
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,040
in this modern day and age if you fight

297
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
in urban environments

298
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,279
uh or outside of urban environments like

299
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,440
unless you're inside of a very

300
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
tight room without rifling it's a

301
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,160
pointless endeavor so you need rifling

302
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,440
you need something out of metal at the

303
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,200
back you need something out of metal

304
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,560
where the cartridge sits inside

305
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,000
and you need the the barrel to be rifled

306
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
now the issue is i was not able to

307
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
buy an illegal firearm i wanted the

308
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
firearm i wanted to be able to

309
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,680
be my own master i wanted to protect my

310
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
rights and i wanted the farm

311
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,200
and i thought well maybe i should get a

312
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,040
firearm illegally

313
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,279
the issue is in truth in europe for

314
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,120
example to get a farm illegally is

315
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
extremely difficult if not impossible

316
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,839
for most people

317
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,279
as the only ways are really that you

318
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,279
i mean the only really true way is that

319
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,040
you are so deep into the criminal

320
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,480
underworld that you have connections

321
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,200
with

322
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,000
with uh with the prostitution circles

323
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,800
with

324
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,200
with the drug importer so you need to be

325
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,160
extremely criminal

326
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,839
and i didn't want to do that so i wanted

327
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,440
i wanted to build it myself

328
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,680
and so i'd need to build these three

329
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,800
components myself

330
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,880
that little thing on the back here the

331
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
thing around the cartridge and this

332
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,839
thing here

333
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,120
now this thing at the back here is

334
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
called a bolt and you see this the

335
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,959
cartridge would sit here

336
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,399
and you see it's out of metal and

337
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,040
usually this is a kind of complex

338
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
geometry meaning it'd be basically

339
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,959
impossible

340
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,720
or at least extremely difficult to make

341
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,079
this from my own

342
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,399
hands without any expensive machinery or

343
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,839
something

344
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
so it would be possible but it would be

345
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
take extremely long time with difficult

346
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,920
to get right it's just

347
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,320
it's a hopeless endeavor for every show

348
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,959
so to say

349
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,640
so let's say i'm average show it's

350
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,440
hopeless for average show

351
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
and so the idea would be how do we make

352
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:34,880
sure that we

353
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,079
simplify this and how do we make sure

354
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:38,640
that we

355
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
are able to still use 3d printing so

356
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,320
it's easier so you just need to push one

357
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
button instead of having

358
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,320
extensive machinery or have something

359
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,839
very labor intensive

360
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
as a process to build it you introduce

361
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,360
3d printing

362
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,519
and just being clever about it and being

363
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,600
clever about it is something that daryl

364
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,240
did

365
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,519
derod is an american who is was a union

366
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,519
carpenter who in his free time

367
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,040
yeah did the research on three different

368
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
printed firearms and he was interested

369
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,480
and so he came up with something

370
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
something very clever

371
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,360
he took two steel pieces basically steel

372
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,000
rods

373
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,399
cut them to a certain length drilled

374
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,600
them so you've got a

375
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,360
firing pin hole so basically when you

376
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,279
have this system here you need something

377
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,880
to reach the back of the cartridge

378
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,320
which is called a firing pin and for

379
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
that you also need a hole here

380
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,720
and that also introduced some difficulty

381
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,320
and so you've got a hole here you've got

382
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,760
these two steel pieces and you've got

383
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
the 3d printed so-called bolt carrier so

384
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,639
basically

385
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,399
all this complicated all these

386
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,000
complicated things around here is 3d

387
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,200
printed and the only thing that

388
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,519
needs to be out of metal is out of metal

389
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,399
is this

390
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,320
kind of thing here which sits which

391
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,839
basically has

392
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,959
which sits between the cartridge and the

393
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,440
yeah it basically faces the back of the

394
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,120
cartridge

395
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,959
and so you basically decided to say

396
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,800
let's use simple

397
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,040
geometrical shapes of steel and let's

398
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,560
use the 3d printer to make

399
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,240
our lives easier and treat for this

400
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
housing so basically you're able to 3d

401
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,519
print the housing

402
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,000
and weld these two steel pieces together

403
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
with a stick welder you can get that for

404
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
50 bucks everywhere i just powered from

405
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,480
your uncle or whatever

406
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,639
and then use jvwelt which is a two-part

407
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,320
epoxy it's like a glue and you

408
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,880
put it in there and then does solve is

409
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,000
the bolt issue

410
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,279
so he innovated really uh

411
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,920
big on this on this issue of using 3d

412
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,480
printing

413
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,880
and using basic tools to be able to

414
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,399
build this complicated thing which is

415
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,079
the vault which is one element element

416
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,200
of building your own firearm

417
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,120
and now comes the really genius part

418
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,519
this is the shotty ap9 this is a farm he

419
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,120
designed and that he

420
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,199
published basically in 2017 there were

421
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,560
previous versions but this is the

422
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,079
basically refined version that he put

423
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,959
out

424
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,199
and not only is does it use that both

425
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,160
that i told you was

426
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,040
simple to to to build to construct and

427
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,440
which

428
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
solved the one issue he also solved

429
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,560
another issue because

430
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,760
if you've got with um with

431
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,160
almost all firearms of this type you

432
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,240
need something to make sure that this

433
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,320
this case here like after you shoot

434
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,680
needs to get out of there and to make

435
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,120
sure to get out of you usually use a

436
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,920
combination of

437
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,000
an extractor and ejector anyways it's

438
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
complicated to build it

439
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,480
and he made it possible so that it's

440
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
easy in construction and

441
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,839
it's not difficult to machine so look

442
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,120
what happens

443
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,279
he pulls the trigger and as the

444
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,959
cartridge comes back which is the case

445
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,279
with

446
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,120
blowback firearms so basically you have

447
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,959
to imagine the case itself

448
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,680
pulls it pull it pulls itself out of the

449
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,519
the chamber out of the pocket here from

450
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,160
its own

451
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,720
power it just pushes it pushes back

452
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,839
basically

453
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,839
as it does that it pushes back the bolt

454
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,519
but at the same time to make sure that

455
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,079
actually

456
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,800
the case flies outside of this area you

457
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,680
see what happens

458
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,600
this little thing comes pushing from the

459
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,040
left and to the right

460
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,639
that's the ejector system and that's the

461
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,920
really genius thing and i'm going to

462
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,720
show you how that works because

463
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,880
because i that's the main mechanism that

464
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,279
i um took over

465
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,199
and so what did i take off or why why

466
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,480
did i why was

467
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
not this the solution that i looked for

468
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
but why didn't it work why couldn't i

469
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,959
just

470
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,079
build what he built and be happy no

471
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,920
i cannot be happy according to the

472
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,000
european governments i cannot be happy

473
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,199
why because in european nations this

474
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,079
piece here

475
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,720
is regulated and the issue is there is

476
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,959
an american and he's able to buy this pc

477
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,079
which is called the barrel

478
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,600
like i told about i told you about the

479
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,279
bolt you can build it yourself

480
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,199
but the issue is the barrel the one of

481
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,560
the three main components that you need

482
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,519
for this firearm

483
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,279
for environment in general and the

484
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,959
barrels you can buy in the us you can

485
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,639
just order it online but in europe these

486
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,440
are regulated

487
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
these are called pressure bearing parts

488
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
so this is the pressure breaking part

489
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,279
this is the pressure bearing part

490
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,519
because as i said it's involved with

491
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,639
this main mechanism

492
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,720
of what's happening here it bears

493
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,000
pressure because of the explosion it

494
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,480
takes

495
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,680
takes place there and so the europeans

496
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,759
are clever and stuff like americans

497
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,639
regulating

498
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,120
just this part they regulate this part

499
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,800
and this part as well

500
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,399
and these parts are extremely difficult

501
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,839
to manufacture

502
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,000
okay with the with the shotty ap9 this

503
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,360
will sell kinda right

504
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,680
but this is not solved he uses a glock

505
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,440
barrel basically this web was

506
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,639
useless for me so what do i do

507
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,360
what i do is how do i make my own barrel

508
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
so i thought i get a barrel bank that's

509
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,480
how you manufacture barrel you get a

510
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,160
barrel plank which is basically

511
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,279
this rifled shape here

512
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,079
in a geometrical simple shape it's just

513
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,399
mostly 30 millimeters of outer diameter

514
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,959
and what you do is then use a lathe to

515
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,880
make sure that the profile

516
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,759
is kinda in a way where you are able to

517
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,480
mount it inside of the weapon

518
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
and then i use this little thing here

519
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,759
which is called the chamber reamer to

520
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,360
make the pocket

521
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,959
the pocket where the cartridge sits

522
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,800
inside here

523
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,839
now the issue is lathe costs around 500

524
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,040
to 1000 bucks

525
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,279
or euros or whatever and these barrel

526
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,040
banks are regulated many countries in

527
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,920
europe in

528
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
some countries it's illegal like you

529
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
cannot get them like regulated you

530
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,959
cannot get them in some countries you

531
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,959
actually can buy them still to the state

532
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,480
but the issue is you need this

533
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,240
and this and you need to know how to use

534
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,480
this and this is expensive and heavy

535
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,599
i personally went this way because i

536
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,240
wanted to

537
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
have a barrel and this was the way to

538
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,000
make a barrel

539
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,799
and my idea was i make a barrel myself

540
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,720
and basically replace this part get rid

541
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,760
of this issue

542
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,079
and use this design to change it

543
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,280
and and i went on this on this endeavor

544
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,520
so but before we continue on that

545
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,200
there's an even better solution than

546
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,120
this because there's a wonderful

547
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,160
solution

548
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,840
where instead of having to buy this

549
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,360
learn how to use this learn how to use

550
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,200
this there's a way simple solution which

551
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,520
everybody around the world can use where

552
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,600
people don't need access to those rifle

553
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,200
bear plants which are difficult to get

554
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,960
and that is electrochemical machining

555
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,440
you've got a contact here the cathode

556
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,280
and the anode and you've got water

557
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,559
which is called electrolyte because

558
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,880
there's water with salt and then you

559
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,200
you put electricity in here and what

560
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,000
happens is you use

561
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,720
electricity in the water to basically

562
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,039
remove material from metal

563
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,480
and this is called electro chemical

564
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,080
machining and so

565
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,480
a clever guy on youtube i'm not sure

566
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,400
when that was posted a video and then

567
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,160
another clever guy from america

568
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
saw that he's called jeff roth who's

569
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
actually kind of acquaintances with this

570
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,440
guy called errol

571
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,679
and jeff rod came up with the principle

572
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,559
of

573
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,360
or basically refine the idea of trying

574
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,039
to use this principle

575
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,919
to make a barrel to basically put this

576
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:34,320
shape

577
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,160
inside of a steel tube that you can buy

578
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,760
from anywhere like you

579
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,280
buy a simple hydraulic pipe from

580
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,679
anywhere later and i will explain that

581
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,200
you can order them from china but what

582
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,160
you need you need to

583
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
put a shape into there it's called

584
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,600
rifling that stabilizes the bullet

585
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,320
and so jeffrey came up with the idea of

586
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,480
electrochemical rifling and

587
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,039
my my friend who actually i basically

588
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,000
recruited

589
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,280
like there's a whole story with the

590
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,120
terran suspense where i created discord

591
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,600
group

592
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,080
posted onto deathcat which cody wilson

593
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,360
ran which was a site where you can

594
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,320
download files

595
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,240
put discord links there i started a

596
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,840
group and so on and so forth recruited

597
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
iron and so on and so forth anyway

598
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,840
so ivan came up with the idea of taking

599
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,960
jeffree's work

600
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
and refining it so that you use this

601
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
principle to make a barrel

602
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,440
for nine millimeter and so the idea

603
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,960
would be he would work

604
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
on the idea of trying to make sure that

605
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,000
people all over the world

606
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
can be able to to produce a nine

607
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,679
millimeter barrel

608
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,160
and this is how it works you've got a

609
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,400
power supply that you can get from

610
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
your camera to supply stores or you can

611
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,919
steal it from your school from the

612
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,440
chemistry class or whatever

613
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,280
physics class and then you get some

614
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,200
hoses you get some ties

615
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,679
zip ties you get a bucket with water and

616
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,840
a water pump for 10 bucks

617
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,799
and then you've got got these fittings

618
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,000
like a brass fitting

619
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,080
which costs not much you 3d print this

620
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,919
jig here and then you

621
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,400
you connect the contacts and you

622
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,039
basically

623
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,520
push water with electricity through this

624
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,120
pipe that you order from china which i

625
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,000
will show you

626
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,360
and then you've got the rifle barrel

627
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,919
now i will show you uh kind of how that

628
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,240
looks

629
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,639
electro chemical

630
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,120
machining and in here specifically

631
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,240
rifling so

632
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,799
i put put a list together so i was

633
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,080
trying to help ivan

634
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
so all you need is this power supply

635
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,840
from china

636
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,159
this pipe from china this steel rod

637
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,919
which you use for borrowing a chambering

638
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,919
you need some salt some water you need

639
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,440
some wires you need

640
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,159
some like alligator clips you need a

641
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,240
water pump you need a power supply

642
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,520
hoses fitting

643
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,240
we i list everything that you need every

644
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,919
single item

645
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,480
every single [ __ ] item that you need

646
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,520
like i do not leave

647
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,559
anything uh like dubious or

648
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,320
unclear which for example there would

649
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,840
actually did like he didn't put out this

650
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,039
much documentation

651
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,880
for people to build the shot the ap9

652
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
there was a video for example

653
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,320
but never has been something so

654
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,760
detailedly uh like

655
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000
presented to build on oh for own firearm

656
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,280
anyways

657
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,320
and this is the shopping list

658
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,880
and this is the guide that i haven't

659
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
vote i even wrote so

660
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,240
it shows you everything it shows you

661
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,520
really every step

662
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,240
has a huge forward and everything all

663
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,280
the jigs it's just

664
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,360
how to assemble everything put

665
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,720
everything together so you

666
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,280
end up with

667
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,640
see that you end up with the barrel so

668
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,960
i will show you how that looks like for

669
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,760
those who

670
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
usually know how barrel looks like but

671
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,840
are in disbelief

672
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,039
so what you can see here is the barrel

673
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,039
and here you see this pattern it's

674
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,840
called rifling

675
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,720
and use this guy to basically produce

676
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,080
your own barrel so this is a

677
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,640
huge thing in itself like people have no

678
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,080
idea how how incredible

679
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
this is

680
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,440
and now what i did is i wanted to do

681
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,880
like i wanted to uh to

682
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,720
to take the shotty ap9 and make sure i'm

683
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
able to to make my to get my own barrel

684
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,400
in like i use the lathe to make my own

685
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,200
barrel

686
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,240
but the issue was it isn't that easy as

687
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,799
you think

688
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,159
because it's the shutter p9 was designed

689
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:22,960
for

690
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,760
for what's it called a glock barrel and

691
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,799
so what i did is i

692
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,280
downloaded the files i put them into cad

693
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,679
and then i worked on them for two years

694
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,679
almost for two years i worked on them

695
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,200
almost every day

696
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,520
and i ended up with with this thing here

697
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,400
and that's the fgc nine [ __ ] gun control

698
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,360
nine millimeter

699
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,640
and so you can see all the plastic parts

700
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,000
all the three printed parts for example

701
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,360
i added the stock this was not there

702
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,520
with the shotty ap9 i changed everything

703
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,799
so you can use european sized basically

704
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,679
fasteners

705
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,039
screws so i basically uh specify

706
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
exactly which screw to use like all this

707
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,520
kind of thing was not the case with any

708
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
previous diy fire before

709
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,679
for example like you can go through this

710
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,720
assembly here

711
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,039
you can see which screw you have to use

712
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,440
so the socket head screw

713
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,280
m5 din 912 25mm so you know exactly

714
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,600
which

715
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,120
screw to order where it goes in and

716
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
everything and i make like this kind of

717
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,400
a model wasn't even there for the shot

718
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,320
the ap9 the shot the unit f9 had no cad

719
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
assembly there were just a few models

720
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,679
and they had a lot of modeling mistakes

721
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,280
and shut like

722
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,200
their wood was is not an engineer or

723
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,960
something so that's okay

724
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,440
anyways i taught myself how to use cat

725
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,000
software

726
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,679
and so i went into this huge long

727
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,559
endeavor how and of refining the firearm

728
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,080
of basically turning the shotty ep 9

729
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,400
into what is the fgc 9 today

730
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,760
and here you see this clever mechanism

731
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,440
where you've got this

732
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,960
piece here which is called ejector

733
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,120
pivots around this point

734
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,520
and because it it goes through here and

735
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,440
the bolt will basically travel back and

736
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,640
push against this year

737
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,760
it gets pivoted and it kicks out the

738
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,679
cases and this was the genius thing that

739
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,480
darwin developed

740
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,159
and this is the fgc9 working that for

741
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,840
two years and

742
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,880
i documented everything and instead of

743
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,400
just pushing this cat assembly out and

744
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,799
just doing one video you know what i did

745
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,640
i did this i wrote

746
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,080
almost 110 page

747
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,559
instructions on how to build this

748
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,679
firearm

749
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,720
a forward outline settings

750
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,440
each item how long it takes how much

751
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,279
filament you need

752
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,039
on which day you should print what so

753
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,960
that you basically after one or two

754
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,640
weeks you're able to have that firm

755
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,559
and you know what i did i [ __ ] hated

756
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,000
that you're al almost

757
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,760
always with these kinds of projects that

758
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,520
you have no idea where to start right

759
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,240
and i wanted people to know exactly what

760
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,600
[ __ ] part to buy

761
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
where to buy it how it should look like

762
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,200
i mean how it needs to look like and

763
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,960
so on and so forth so i listed every

764
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
[ __ ] thing every [ __ ] tool every

765
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,279
[ __ ] material every [ __ ] part

766
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,200
you see you see how [ __ ] detailed

767
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,279
this is i have not seen such a thing

768
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,799
ever before for such a thing

769
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,760
for for diy form or something diy in

770
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
general like this

771
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,000
this detail i made sure because i want

772
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
everyone to have the opportunity to

773
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,360
build this fire i'm not just me

774
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,120
like that's not about just me it's about

775
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,039
the whole [ __ ] world and so

776
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,880
for example one of the major components

777
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,360
which is kind of difficult to get is

778
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,760
the ar-15 fire control group which is

779
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,200
basically the thing that you pull the

780
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,880
trigger on and then the hammer strikes

781
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
on the back of the firing pin

782
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,799
and that that is an issue right people

783
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,720
cannot get real firearm milled parts

784
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,000
so a friend of mine suggested

785
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,480
or we came up together how about we try

786
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,080
to substitute with airsoft parts and

787
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,600
which is actually possible so i elicit

788
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,880
even the airsoft option

789
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,320
and everything else you can buy without

790
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,159
any issues at all and so

791
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,640
i show with detailed pictures how to

792
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,000
build the firing pin for example

793
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,679
with the shotty ap9 this firing pin for

794
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,520
example you needed a lathe actually

795
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,279
did you know that you didn't not just

796
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,559
the glock barrel but you actually

797
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,520
actually need lathe to make the

798
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,120
firepoint so i came up with a way

799
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,840
to use simple tools as you see to make

800
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,640
this firing pin and use this jb welds to

801
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,080
put everything together and so on and so

802
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,760
forth and so i show you almost

803
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
everything

804
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,720
and i basically took influence from ikea

805
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,200
and made

806
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
these assembling instructions on top of

807
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
all the other pictures and so on and so

808
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,039
forth

809
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,880
so that you know exactly how to assemble

810
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,039
this time you have to realize i want

811
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,799
average joe to build this fam not an

812
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,559
environment enthusiast or something i

813
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:30,960
want

814
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,279
average show to build this farm because

815
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,799
without thinking of every show this is

816
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,760
pointless

817
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
without any instructions that every joke

818
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,039
can build it without

819
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,720
trying to teach them how to build it

820
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,240
it's pointless what's

821
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,000
what's a really cool plan to design a

822
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
model or whatever wealth

823
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,960
wealth to him if he cannot build it and

824
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,880
make it himself

825
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,720
and so as i said the instructions are

826
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,520
extremely detailed

827
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,720
i put a lot of work in this and

828
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,320
i even show like what to do if something

829
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,520
goes wrong and so forth and so on

830
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,240
and then eventually i released this

831
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,960
thing

832
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,600
and that was that

833
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,640
and so you know what ecm rifling is

834
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,039
and this is how it looks like i always

835
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,000
showed you that

836
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,480
and i released this fire and you know

837
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,200
where i did

838
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,760
release it on deathcat the same site

839
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
where the liberator originally was

840
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
the same site that cody wilson would

841
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,039
present the liberator

842
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,159
uh he runs that site and he was where i

843
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,240
posted those discord invite links to

844
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,720
which basically this discord group later

845
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,480
became the terran suspense

846
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,679
so where it began it ended up again

847
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,399
and i released it and this is the fgc 9

848
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,840
in action

849
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,360
and it doesn't stop there

850
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,399
it doesn't stop there this is the next

851
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,480
version it's called the fgc9 mark

852
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,159
ii and so in some

853
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:17,840
undisclosed location i'm testing it

854
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,919
and here you go you can see the that air

855
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:22,960
actually cases

856
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,120
and i'm using a breast catcher and so on

857
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,399
and so forth

858
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,600
and that's the next version so it

859
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,679
doesn't even stop there and you know

860
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,279
what i'm actually gonna show it

861
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,559
show that to you in person so this was

862
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,000
the ftc nine mark one

863
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,559
any glock magazines go in there and by

864
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,919
the way i haven't developed three

865
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,520
printed versions of plug magazines so

866
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,480
you can you don't

867
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,080
even need to buy a glock magazine you 3d

868
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
print it and order the magazine spring

869
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,600
the only part that you need to buy

870
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,279
from china from aliexpress and now

871
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,720
you've got the magazine which is 3d

872
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,559
printed which i haven't developed

873
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,600
anyways glock magazine this is how you

874
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,120
charge it right what the issue is when

875
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,679
you shoot

876
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,080
you've got the ejector which pivots here

877
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,159
which pivots and gets into your

878
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,559
way as well this this is an issue

879
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,200
because

880
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,039
in the instructions i show you how to

881
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,240
install this but it's

882
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,000
it's really tricky and annoying in the

883
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,159
ass to install it without breaking your

884
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,000
tap that you use to

885
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,360
put threads in here so that you're able

886
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,039
to thread it in and

887
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,919
yeah i've added this don't worry it's i

888
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,760
already checked it it's empty

889
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,799
and i added the stock like

890
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,080
that that was not even there with the

891
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,000
chatty ap9 has a rail

892
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,120
i elongated the rail i like i said i

893
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,440
simplified how to assemble it and i

894
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
changed everything to metric

895
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,399
and i simplified the way you've got this

896
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,240
magazine catch assembly

897
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,440
and basically you've got a

898
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
semi-automatic so one trigger pull one

899
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,600
shot a nine millimeter firearm

900
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,760
this is that is this easy to build this

901
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,679
this robust not just one shot

902
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,679
but shot shot shots until the magazine

903
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,600
is empty next magazine and you can

904
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,559
continue

905
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,640
and the reason why this works better

906
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,159
than the chatty ap9 additionally is

907
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,200
because i showed you

908
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,760
this barrel sits inside of shaft collars

909
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,240
so it's

910
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,720
three thick steel pieces that are around

911
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,000
the chamber area of the

912
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,840
of the barrel and that way the heat

913
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,039
transfers first to the

914
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,159
steel shaft collars and it acts as a

915
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,720
buffer like a heat buffer and that's why

916
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,120
you're able to shoot without any issues

917
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,600
of

918
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
it heating the plastic so it melts so

919
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,919
this was the fgc nine mark one

920
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,360
and this is the fgc9 mark ii

921
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,720
and the wonderful thing is now no longer

922
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,880
is this ejector here flipping like that

923
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,960
and the charging handle does not go back

924
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,320
and forth and it could

925
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,440
go into the way of your hand but no um

926
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,120
one of the guys who was in the vera

927
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
testing group you know what a beta

928
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
testing kind of thing is obviously

929
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,880
with you you obviously have worked in

930
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
software and so on and so forth or just

931
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,200
know that

932
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,799
term i had a better testing group

933
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,880
running one of the beta testers

934
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,640
never modeled in this like he had no

935
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,399
engineering background nothing

936
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,320
and he one just had interest to build

937
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,519
this ability fgc9 the original one

938
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,360
and in a matter of few months he learned

939
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
cad and actually not only helped me in

940
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,640
the beta testing of this

941
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,120
firearm he actually contributed by

942
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,200
modifying the original design

943
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,440
and him and me and a little bit with

944
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,399
ivan's help

945
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,000
we came up with this new charging handle

946
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,399
system so basically now it works like an

947
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,440
mp5

948
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
so you can push it back and now you can

949
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
for example inspect the

950
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,919
chamber area here so you when you want

951
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,519
to take a look

952
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,919
or fix some things you can just take a

953
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,519
look no longer need do you need to hold

954
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,159
it here

955
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,360
and now what you can do is you can

956
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,039
insert the magazine and just like with

957
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:39,679
mp5

958
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,960
those guys who are like firearms do the

959
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,880
mp5 slap and um we've got a longer top

960
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,679
rail

961
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,679
i mounted the red dot and a magnifier on

962
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,679
here and

963
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,360
because i used the lathe remember i

964
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,120
didn't use ecm rifling but

965
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,679
we included uh i included the

966
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,799
instructions how to

967
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,640
make your own barrel with ecm rifle

968
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,240
included with the files

969
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,880
and so ivan's ecm rifling guide is also

970
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,640
in the file so you can ecm rifle your

971
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,919
barrel so

972
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,600
very easy to make the barrel but i use

973
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,440
the lathe and that way i could add

974
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,640
threads here so i'm able to put on a

975
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,000
suppressor and so when i'm using

976
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,919
subsonic ammo so ammo with a heavier

977
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:18,880
projectile

978
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,960
that is moving at around 1000 fps it's

979
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
subsonic and with the suppressor it's

980
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,039
really

981
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,640
quiet and since you know that i'm

982
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,720
kind of from a place which restricts

983
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,760
fire

984
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,720
fire ownership uh the only way that i'm

985
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,559
safely able to test the firearm

986
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,720
and to shoot it is to try to be as quiet

987
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,840
as possible that's why i need a

988
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,200
suppressor

989
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,320
and so new charging handle

990
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,399
better looking stock and the guy who

991
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,000
helped me is basically by the way called

992
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,679
three sucks and crux

993
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,000
and he modeled this stock based on the

994
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,840
fat defense stock which are available

995
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
for air 15 stocks

996
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,159
and you can also 3d print the the pistol

997
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,039
grip i

998
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,000
we had an m4 tdp leaked to us from a

999
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,960
certain individual

1000
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,000
and i took the m4 tdp model and

1001
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,559
modified it so you can 3d print the grip

1002
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,080
that is also in the files

1003
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,000
but i'm using something from magpul

1004
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,120
because it's just more comfortable and

1005
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,799
it's got a got a battery compartment

1006
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,440
anyway

1007
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,200
those are kind of like tiny details you

1008
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,480
actually don't need to know about

1009
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,640
but anyways it's a pretty cool

1010
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,840
functional firearm

1011
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,519
and this is the state of the art right

1012
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,360
now and this

1013
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,440
is what i can use to protect my life

1014
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,519
or to take away the life of somebody who

1015
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,640
wants to do me harm

1016
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,000
and that is the fgc 9 and soon there

1017
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,919
will be more and more firms like this

1018
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,760
there's no stopping us and now

1019
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,159
what about ammo wait wait a minute wait

1020
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,200
a minute wait a minute

1021
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,720
stop the recording scratch noise

1022
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,600
what about the ammo [ __ ] we

1023
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,440
already thought of that

1024
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,080
let me show you

1025
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,080
so ivan of course knows about my issues

1026
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,600
all the time because i'm always

1027
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,200
always saying yeah man in europe the

1028
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
farm laws are so brutal

1029
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,360
i cannot buy ammo oh my god oh my god oh

1030
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,800
my god so me and ivan

1031
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,199
always discussing and we thought about

1032
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,040
how how do we make sure that people can

1033
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,199
get their own ammo even in europe

1034
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,040
and so i was talking about what's called

1035
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,159
nail gun blanks basically you've got a

1036
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,800
tool

1037
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,960
to put in stuff against the wall and

1038
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,399
construction and so forth

1039
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,918
and those naked blanks have powder in

1040
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,918
them kind of the same powder as in

1041
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,599
europe

1042
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,199
as in general as this kind of thin

1043
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,960
powder as in pistol cartridges

1044
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,000
so just to to explain a little more

1045
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,800
to to be able to have ammo you you need

1046
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,599
to buy it which

1047
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,199
is not possible also you need to smuggle

1048
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,480
it in which is very difficult and

1049
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,119
there's

1050
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,800
no market just like the drugs you'd need

1051
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,320
to make the ammo yourself

1052
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,839
but the issue is for ammo to make it

1053
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,760
yourself you can buy everything yes but

1054
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,280
the issue is the propellant the actual

1055
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
powder that is inside of the ammo

1056
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,879
the actual thing that burns in there to

1057
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,640
make the explosion and that is regulated

1058
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,680
that is illegal to

1059
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,480
illegal basically it's very hard to get

1060
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,920
and so we are talking about nail on

1061
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,079
blanks and so i said to ivan hey

1062
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,440
this is the situation with nail gun

1063
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,119
planks um

1064
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,520
you he said people have used that

1065
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,359
already to make ammo but

1066
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,200
there's no good information about there

1067
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,480
out there about how to

1068
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,119
to use negron blank powder to make ammo

1069
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,320
so what did he do

1070
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,640
i worked with him to to show him the

1071
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,400
situation in europe what is able what

1072
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,839
you're able to buy and what you're not

1073
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:26,960
able to buy

1074
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,040
so he wrote this guide he actually

1075
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,960
ordered this the blanks that you're able

1076
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,480
to buy in europe i told him these are

1077
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,920
the most popular blanks available in

1078
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,359
europe and what did he do he actually

1079
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,760
bought them in america

1080
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,200
and he created this guide so just like

1081
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,520
with my instructions in his instructions

1082
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
you see everything that you need to buy

1083
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,119
to be able to use these nail gun

1084
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,960
blankets you can buy on ebay

1085
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,839
use 3d printed tools and everything else

1086
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,599
you can buy order online in europe

1087
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,119
like the cases and bullets they are

1088
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,800
available in europe and even the primers

1089
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,640
you can reload by taking the old premise

1090
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,599
from old cases

1091
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,280
and then using compound that you scrape

1092
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
off out of the nail down blanks and put

1093
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,839
it into the new

1094
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,720
primer cup and so on and so forth and so

1095
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,160
this guide shows you how to make your

1096
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,839
own ammo in europe

1097
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,680
and there is no saying anymore

1098
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,040
that this is pointless what you're doing

1099
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,480
what about emma what about this what

1100
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,880
about barrel

1101
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,079
we [ __ ] gun control forget we

1102
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,640
[ __ ] gun control for good gun control

1103
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,720
is effectively dead

1104
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,560
we talk about semi-automatic

1105
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,839
nine-millimeter firearms

1106
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,920
in europe and most most of europe

1107
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,920
basically in europe

1108
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,280
gun control is dead and we killed it and

1109
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
all this journey started because i was

1110
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,960
fed up with the situation here myself

1111
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,720
and this is how you get the ability

1112
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,440
to protect lives or take lives with the

1113
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,839
internet and 3d printing

1114
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,320
thank you for having listened and

1115
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,760

1117
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,359

it was it's actually incredible the um

1123
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,480
the freedom of spread of information

1124
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,920
that the internet gives us

1125
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,160
um and the kind of decentralization that

1126
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,119
things like

1127
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,119
3d printing provide for us so thank you

1128
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,400
so much for sharing that

1129

i would like to hear more about the

1136
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,320
adoption of this technology

1137
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,280
do you get feedback from users do you

1138
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,920
know how many people are using this now

1139
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,720
my friend they have already been

1140
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,960
multiple people who have built the fcc-9

1141
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,480
the initial version and they've shared

1142
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,400
videos all over the place

1143
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,160
just open up youtube right now and type

1144
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,480
in fgc9

1145
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,079
and then you'll see it there are

1146
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,320
multiple videos go on twitter and just

1147
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,079
type in fgc9

1148
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,920
and you'll see images after images and

1149
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,599
we have a huge community going like

1150
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,320
after i posted this those discord links

1151
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,000
determine suspense kind of formed we

1152
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,520
were kind of a private group

1153
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,200
i haven't decided let's go on to key

1154
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,680
base and have a broader pro

1155
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,000
pro a broader audience interact with us

1156
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,440
and so if you want to interact

1157
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,359
users want to interact they come to key

1158
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,040
based into our key base group

1159

1160
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,160

corporation so like youtube and when it

1177
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,359
comes to like censoring videos

1178
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,000
um or the state um how have they reacted

1179
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,160
to this because surely they must realize

1180
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,760
what's going on here so what has the

1181
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,839
reaction been so first of all the

1182
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:08,880
reaction

1183
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,400
has basically not been there and

1184
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,000
compared to what was happening during

1185
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,720
the

1186
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,160
time when the liberator came out so

1187
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,400
people are [ __ ] asleep on this

1188
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,760
they do not realize how [ __ ]

1189
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,000
significant this is that you can rifle

1190
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,359
your own variables now that you can 3d

1191
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,560
print your own magazines now that you

1192
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,119
can

1193
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,200
make a 39 millimeter semi-automatic

1194
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,880
firearm really easily right now

1195
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,040
and that you can make your own ammo from

1196
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,560
from stuff you can order online

1197
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,880
people are asleep on this so the issue

1198
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,560
with youtube for example is if you post

1199
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,240
a video like this on youtube

1200
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,680
most of the time it gets removed because

1201
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
people report it and so on and so forth

1202
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,119
but the government's authorities have

1203
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,359
been asleep on this and even the fact

1204
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,680
that the those nail gun blanks are you

1205
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,440
can still purchase on ebay and you still

1206
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
can make live ammo with that

1207
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,960
nobody is [ __ ] uh aware of this

1208
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,200
in the in the under governments and so

1209
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,640
on and so forth it's still available you

1210
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,359
still can buy

1211
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,280
thousands of nail gun blanks have them

1212
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,359
at home by all the other components and

1213
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:01,920
have like

1214
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,240
10 000 rounds of 9 millimeter 9

1215
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,640
millimeter ammo at home and

1216
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,680
it's incredible that nobody is being

1217
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,920
aware enough of this basically uh form

1218
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,440
from the standpoint of

1219
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,240
haha [ __ ] gun con [ __ ] guns and guns

1220
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,760
should be illegal from that standpoint

1221
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,880
people are [ __ ] asleep and um

1222
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,480
i think it's because of corona because

1223
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,400
of covet but

1224
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,079
maybe people will wake up soon enough

1225
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,839
and i think they will because

1226
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,960
there's going to be a documentary coming

1227
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,520
soon to the to the public that i

1228
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,040
recorded

1229
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,240
or was recorded by somebody i worked

1230
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,560
with

1231
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,040
and uh you'll that'll be interesting to

1232
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,880
see as well

1233
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,400
that's insane it's insane with their

1234
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,000
sleep i mean it's it's predictable that

1235
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,359
they're sleeping on it but um i would

1236
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,720
have thought it would be a bit quicker

1237
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,119
to

1238
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,560
catch on to the fact that you can

1239
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,880
actually make your own um firearms

1240
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,119
um is there anyone else who'd like to

1241
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,960
ask anything

1242
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,319
yes one more question

1243
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,400
hey uh well guess more than one question

1244
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,440
one is uh how much did you know about

1245
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,480
guns before you started in this project

1246
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,560
and another one like last time i checked

1247
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,760
the uh the mark

1248
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,960
ii was not published yet uh so

1249
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,839
uh are you still working on some details

1250
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:20,160
and

1251
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,119
uh when when yeah thank you for your

1252
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:23,760
questions

1253
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,400
uh so first off before i started the

1254
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,000
endeavor with the fgc 9

1255
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,480
and before i posted those discord links

1256
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,800
on devcad and started this community and

1257
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,000
so on and so forth

1258
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,920
before that i was really on the

1259
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,839
experience with firearms

1260
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,240
a few times shooting them myself and i

1261
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:40,880
also

1262
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,800
was in a place where you shoot them

1263
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,160
because that's

1264
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,720
what you do that's your job and but i

1265
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,560
had no idea what building firms had no

1266
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,839
idea three different things

1267
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,440
like during those years from 2017 2018 i

1268
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,960
had to teach myself how to use cad

1269
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,720
software how to use 3d printing like

1270
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,760
basically i

1271
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,280
learned i learned as i did i learned

1272
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,680
out of necessity out of frustration i

1273
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,880
learned on youtube

1274
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,040
since the [ __ ] government the state

1275
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,880
forced me to learn all this [ __ ]

1276
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,640
because i wanted my own firearm i need

1277
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,480
to build it myself so i needed to learn

1278
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,880
all this [ __ ] [ __ ] myself and in

1279
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,400
regards to the release

1280
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,440
of the mark ii basically

1281
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,960
the design itself is basically almost

1282
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,359
finished like for the most part like a

1283
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,520
mean three socks are active developing

1284
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,079
uh

1285
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,119
on it and uh threesox has built uh like

1286
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,359
at least three three or four prototype

1287
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,040
builds and i have built uh

1288
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,599
this prototype built of the mark ii and

1289
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,119
we have been testing it

1290
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,440
and we are trying to refine it but the

1291
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,960
main issue right now of course is

1292
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,040
documentation like i showed you that pdf

1293
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,280
i still need to make a pdf uh that

1294
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,160
details the

1295
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,079
assembly of this and also there was the

1296
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,280
little issue

1297
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,520
where i accidentally deleted a few

1298
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,640
pictures that i

1299
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,920
took for the construction process and so

1300
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,319
that's

1301
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,520
um that basically stalled things and so

1302
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,119
it's probably going to take until like

1303
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,560
almost the end of november

1304
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,520
until the mark 2 releases but you have

1305
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,040
to realize we do that on

1306
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,560
our own free time with no no payment

1307
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:14,960
from

1308
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,640
anybody except donations so so you gotta

1309
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,520
gotta be okay with us taking a long time

1310
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,800
but if you wanna accelerate the

1311
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,640
development just help us in general you

1312
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,319

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,520
pdf

1315
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,640
uh it's just tinyurl slash jstock1809

1316
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,040

1317
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,480
you can donate to me or the others on

1318
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,319
keyways just find their profiles

1319
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,680
and you can contribute thank you um and

1320
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,800
i've actually got one

1321
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,200
one question um how big is the community

1322
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,560
and where is the

1323
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,839
where in the world is their most

1324
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,000
interest in this like is it europe or is

1325
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,760
it as you mentioned like brazil or new

1326
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,640
zealand

1327
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,880
so we've got i think thousands i think

1328
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,680
10 000 people around 10 10 000 people or

1329
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,319
something

1330
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,720
on key base and other places we've got a

1331
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,000
huge following on twitter

1332
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,839
like just type in the term suspense or

1333
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,079
det underscore the isp

1334
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,720
or just google just google fgc9 whatever

1335
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,880
and you'll find places where people are

1336
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,200
and we are have a big community what you

1337
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,720
have to realize many people are in

1338
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,440
countries

1339
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,920
in europe and areas where firearms are

1340
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,440
restricted so they're not eager to

1341
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:19,920
really

1342
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,680
reveal themselves so we have really no

1343
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,280
idea how big the actual community and

1344
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,400
the interest is

1345
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,319
but we've got interest really from all

1346
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,240
over the world and when it comes to

1347
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:28,960
stuff

1348
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,280
which for example free free men don't

1349
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,160
ask which is a guy

1350
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,760
develops or in carbonate they make like

1351
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,680
those those

1352
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,160
this kind of a fire part of a firearm

1353
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,680
that is what americans

1354
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,440
are interested the most because that's

1355
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,040
intro that's regulated in

1356
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,960
in us and everything else you can buy

1357
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,319
like the bolts and barrels

1358
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,079
and so that is a huge thing that people

1359
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,599
are interested in that's from america

1360
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,400
but when it comes to the fgc 9

1361
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,920
and the uh emma that you can make

1362
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,440
yourself that is

1363
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,599
better like that is really popular in

1364
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,440
europe and elsewhere in the world and

1365
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,960
like i said we've get constantly

1366
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
messages and pictures of people saying

1367
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,760

1368

1369
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,520

1370
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,520

1372
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,720
