13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,520
the role of

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,120
ai and technology uh in

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,120
the creation and challenging of the

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,200
state so please

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559

thank you so much for a warm welcome

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,399
hello everyone

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,079
that you're watching online streaming

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,160
it's great to have this hybrid model

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,559
um i'm uh really really honored to be

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,399
here um baranipolis is something that

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,760
i've been involved in relatively

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,559
recently but

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,720
something that i've actually all my life

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,159
believed in without realizing that

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,760
there's actually a physical space that

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,119
represents that in prague

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,720
so i'm thrilled to be a part of this and

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,159
thrilled to be speaking at this

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,960
at this conference um originally i'm an

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
archaeologist and cognitive evolutionary

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,840
anthropologist

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,159
um who got sick of academia because it

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,040
took too long

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,119
and not much was moving and it was a

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,320
really kind of

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,240
uh weird system that didn't really suit

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,479
me so i went into startups i went into

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,119
tech

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,799
and i i've spent there probably like the

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,040
last eight years in various startups

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
whether they were based in new zealand

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
los angeles or london

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
where i lived almost 10 years hence the

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,159
stupid accent i picked that up from

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,759
monty python pretty much

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,640
um what i'll be talking about today is

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
actually bridging that gap between um

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
ai and archaeology because right now the

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
way that we view technology is through a

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,880
very narrow lens like we've got our

55
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,520
phones

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,119
we hear artificial intelligence being

57
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,560
spoken about all the time

58
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
but actually if we look at the long

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,840
vista of human history

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,759
there's a lot of other inventions like

61
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,880
writing fire

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,520
stone tools that created a huge social

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,878
revolution

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,878
and i think that we need to view the

65
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
technological world that we live in now

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,760
through a similar lens

67
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
so what i'm going to try and do is

68
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
bridge that gap today

69
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
and also show you how traditionally

70
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,360
technologies have been used to both

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
challenge

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
but also uphold the state so today's

73
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,080
agenda

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
um by the way i'm sorry just got to

75
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,360
close the door because as much as i love

76
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,239
popular music

77
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,440
i'll get thrown off

78
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,680
ugh i'm like an 80 year old man in a

79
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,160
20-something-year-old body

80
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,959
um there we go right so today's agenda

81
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,239
we'll be talking about historical

82
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,080
technologies because technology does not

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,640
just

84
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,959
equal algorithms and like your latest

85
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,920
macbook

86
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,000
um we're also going to be talking about

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,680
my personal story so i've started

88
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,040
working um in the

89
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,360
tech now giant soon to go public um

90
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,959
palantir which is an interesting

91
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
company of its own and then i like

92
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,879
through various vistas i ended up

93
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,840
actually building the digital

94
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,879
infrastructure

95
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,959
um on both sides of brexit amongst other

96
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
things so completely i'm completely

97
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,480
apolitical like politics does not

98
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,239
interest me at all because i think it's

99
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,440
all the same

100
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,239
garbage but um um it was really

101
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,400
interesting like being able to compare

102
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
like the left and the right sides of the

103
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,440
spectrum and i'll be

104
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,519
sharing some of my lessons from that um

105
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,080
i'll also be busting some myths about ai

106
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,799
because

107
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,360
ai is definitely not what it actually is

108
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,080
portrayed by

109
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,159
the media um and i'll be talking about

110
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,680
that a little bit in more detail

111
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,440
and finally my predictions of the future

112
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
i mean it's not like anyone's interested

113
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,640
i'm literally just like some random

114
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,319
archaeologist thinking oh my god what's

115
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,680
going to happen in 50 years

116
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,360
but i think it's important to be talking

117
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
about that because our society goes

118
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
through certain cycles and we're at a

119
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
at a breaking point where traditionally

120
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,239
i think that there would have been a

121
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,200
revolution

122
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
we're not necessarily going to have an

123
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,080
outward revolution as we have had in the

124
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,120
past but um

125
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
there is that tension building and i

126
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,159
think it's curious to think about what's

127
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,360
going to happen in the next few decades

128
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,760
so just to have some key um definitions

129
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,599
for today because um that's always

130
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,120
important to coin down

131
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
first of all what the state is so state

132
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
isn't political parties um the state

133
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
isn't um something that you see like

134
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,280
drawn on an

135
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,439
organizational map the state is

136
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,120
intrinsically linked with the way that

137
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,079
humans um

138
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,160
have evolved in the way that humans

139
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
human societies have evolved throughout

140
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,320
the ages

141
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,759
so even tribes of um like

142
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,600
prehistoric people um that have been

143
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
organizing themselves had some kind of

144
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,240
state

145
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,560
so for example the kalahari bushmen um

146
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
of sub-saharan africa and the various

147
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,080
tribes like the azandi and the newer

148
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,240
that live there having incredibly

149
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,479
intrinsic exchange mechanisms for

150
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,759
example for cattle

151
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,000
or they um have a very like artificial

152
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,759
almost system of communism where

153
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,160
if a hunter comes from a successful hunt

154
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,520
and they ha the other hunter has not

155
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,639
been successful and

156
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,000
say the other hunter brings like this

157
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,759
massive kudu that they've killed

158
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,759
is going to feed the entire village they

159
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,960
actually go through these really

160
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,880
elaborate rituals where they play down

161
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
what they've achieved

162
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,440
so that the other hunter won't get

163
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
offended and they share everything and

164
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
they take like the worst part of the

165
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,680
carcass

166
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
but it's an incredibly artificial system

167
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
of rituals because if they didn't have

168
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:09,759
that

169
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,440
like a hierarchy would suddenly build up

170
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,880
really quickly and they would all murder

171
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,840
each other so

172
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,759
um it's really important not to think of

173
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,520
the state as just like some

174
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
1984 concept but something that is

175
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,639
intrinsically linked in

176
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440
the very complex human creatures minds

177
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,160
technology

178
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,919
again um i've already mentioned this i

179
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,680
don't want us to view it only as like

180
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,919
sets of electronics or algorithms

181
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,600
technology can be writing like

182
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,199
technology can be the printing press it

183
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,479
can be the steam engine

184
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,639
basically an innovation that is scaled

185
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,320
and that rapidly changes the way that we

186
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,360
perceive

187
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,919
the the world around us artificial

188
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,520
intelligence now

189
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
that's a difficult one to coin and i'm

190
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,639
sure that there'll be

191
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,080
someone who'll disagree with me which is

192
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
completely fine because that's what

193
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,639
these things are for

194
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,840
um i actually don't think that we should

195
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,039
be using the term artificial

196
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,400
intelligence because it implies

197
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,039
something

198
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,639
that's equal to a human brain or

199
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,960
basically like the human brain only like

200
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
replicated in some kind of artificial

201
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,039
setting or like some kind of like robot

202
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,160
terminator that can

203
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
do its own stuff and think of its own

204
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,400
it's not that it's glorified statistics

205
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,759
the way that we have it now

206
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,400
and very like sophisticated and amazing

207
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,840
um analytical models

208
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,280
that can work very very quickly with

209
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,199
huge chunks of data but they're not

210
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,479
thinking of their own like

211
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,479
i saw this um thing the other day where

212
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,680
they said oh there were these two

213
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,400
chatbots

214
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
talking to each other and they invented

215
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
a new secret language and they had to be

216
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,720
switched off

217
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,639
no they didn't the like the programmer

218
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,479
was right and like they suddenly

219
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,520
started talking

220
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,880
in a pattern that someone didn't

221
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
understand and they switched off because

222
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
it was embarrassing like that that's it

223
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,039
um artificial general intelligence i've

224
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,600
got several friends who are fantastic um

225
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
scientists in this regard um who are

226
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
working on that research

227
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,880
we're decades away from that if we're

228
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,960
being optimistic and we might never even

229
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,759
get there so

230
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,440
it's a really long way off and seeing

231
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,960
artificial intelligence as

232
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
like this omniscient creator of fake

233
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,160
news etc

234
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
is just that's not what it is think of

235
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
it as efficient and effective

236
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
statistical models

237
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,479
society and culture again like i took

238
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
i chose really easy things to define

239
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,680
didn't i that's that's awesome i'll get

240
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,440
stuck on this slide i knew i would

241
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
um society and culture again it's a very

242
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,720
transient thing so

243
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,360
humans have this um propensity to see

244
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,199
the world around them a status quo so oh

245
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,560
we live in nation states

246
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,000
oh we live in the czech republic that's

247
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,759
always been there oh there's germany

248
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,960
that's always been there

249
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,639
really hasn't like germany was unified

250
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,639
on the bismarck which is pretty recent

251
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
czech republic is what like 30 years old

252
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,360
um like we live in a really new system

253
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,440
um and we're being forced to adopt it as

254
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
status quo and that's just not the case

255
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,840
at all

256
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
we're also forced to adopt like an

257
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
almost evolutionary directional

258
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,560
view of society so like you go from i

259
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,960
don't know a tribe into like eventually

260
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,240
an empire and then

261
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
you're the enlightened republic again no

262
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,280
like the

263
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
roman empire started off as a republic

264
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
and then switched into an empire

265
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,840
you had akhenaten in ancient egypt who

266
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
literally within the span of a

267
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,800
generation took a huge

268
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,879
polytheistic where they believed in like

269
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,560
say 50 different gods

270
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,199
to one god to 50 different gods all in

271
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,720
the span of a generation so

272
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,319
humans tend to experiment with social

273
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,000
structures and that's completely fine

274
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,520
but we shouldn't be afraid to do that

275
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,960
and we're being put in a situation where

276
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,319
that experimentation is

277
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,720
massively discouraged because obviously

278
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,759
it would cost a lot

279
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,000
for some people not to have it that way

280
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,759
so historical abuse

281
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,960
of technology um there's a couple of

282
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,479
technologies that i really want to point

283
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,160
out um that it

284
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,919
again doesn't have to be an algorithm to

285
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,440
to be abused so

286
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,519
writing industrial revolution wars and

287
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,240
weaponry opium and spices and like other

288
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,159
very rare things and the control of that

289
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,958
trade

290
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,880
um control of transportation and

291
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,719
infrastructure radio and film and

292
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,040
even the concept of borders all of those

293
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,800
they might not seem like technologies to

294
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,680
start off with but

295
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,320
they're all used as uh and spoken about

296
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,760
the way that artificial intelligence for

297
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
example is spoken about now

298
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,720
and i'll go into a little bit more

299
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
detail into all of them so writing he

300
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
had the invention of writing roughly

301
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
three and a half thousand years bc um

302
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
obviously the egyptologists and

303
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,920
mesopotamian specialists um

304
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,240
massively argue about that but the

305
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
effect that it had was not that he had

306
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,000
writing suddenly had an elite group of

307
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,040
people that um

308
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
were teaching how to do hieroglyphs

309
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,720
because not every egyptian peasant could

310
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,000
do this obviously

311
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
that created a new educational system it

312
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
created a new pharynx system

313
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,399
it led to the unification of egypt like

314
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,160
there were really big social changes

315
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
that happened with that

316
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,839
when the printing press came in

317
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,519
everything changed dramatically again

318
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,200
because suddenly writing wasn't just

319
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,920
something that

320
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
a few monks or a few scribes can do like

321
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
the regular population

322
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,800
suddenly started being exposed to like

323
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
literacy and like

324
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
pieces of work could be replicated books

325
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
could be printed the bible got

326
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,240
translated from latin into english

327
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
which by the way was one of the biggest

328
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,240
like social wars of um

329
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,880
of the last millennium probably and it

330
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,480
led to a huge divide in europe where

331
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,360
you've got like

332
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,279
countries with a protestant um tradition

333
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,040
and countries with a catholic tradition

334
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,880
and it caused civil wars like for

335
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,160
example in the uk

336
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,959
or britain um so all of these had huge

337
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,920
connotations and

338
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,240
they were all used to control the public

339
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
remember you used to go to mass

340
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,399
and listen to two hours of latin not

341
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,320
understanding a single word of what was

342
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,120
being said

343
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
then they came out of church and they

344
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
were like yeah yeah that was really

345
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,640
interesting

346
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
was it like you literally just don't

347
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,240
know what was being said and then

348
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,519
suddenly these things started being in

349
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,519
english and people started challenging

350
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,079
them and

351
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,640
that's where a huge um clashes started

352
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,839
happening and i think it's similar to

353
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,279
what we're seeing now

354
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,440
alphabets again um encrypting this

355
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,399
knowledge i'm

356
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
cool to vietnamese and um one of the

357
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
things that the french did um when they

358
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,640
um

359
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,040
invaded indochina and when they kind of

360
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,760
colonized

361
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,000
what is now vietnam um they changed

362
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,959
their traditional

363
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,680
uh script into the latin alphabet they

364
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,040
still couldn't understand a word of

365
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,800
vietnamese they didn't speak vietnamese

366
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,880
but for them it was culturally much more

367
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,240
digestible so again

368
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,200
you see this play with the ways of means

369
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
of expression

370
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
um mao for example in china he tried to

371
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,040
actually

372
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
do the same to the chinese script but

373
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
there because chinese is so connected to

374
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,200
confucian uh philosophy

375
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
he actually found out that despite the

376
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
disgusting dictator that he was

377
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
he was actually unable to push culture

378
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,399
that far people were holding on to that

379
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,120
so

380
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,880
it's really interesting to just observe

381
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,720
like zoom out and see what has happened

382
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
been happening through history and

383
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,079
obviously cryptic messages things like

384
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,000
enigma fighting wars where

385
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
writing was absolutely key and often

386
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
like the turning point

387
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,279
in a very bloody conflict um it just

388
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,399
shows the huge power of this invention

389
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,920
uh the industrial revolutions that have

390
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,440
happened from the steam engine to

391
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,480
electricity like

392
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,000
the adoption of electricity was

393
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,680
basically a political coup

394
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,640
like the whole ac versus dc um current

395
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,279
wars

396
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,000
um it was the whole columbia exposition

397
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,440
and it was the world fair

398
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,920
um all that was about that people wanted

399
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,000
to get like the state money to

400
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
be the one like the edison versus the

401
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,120
westinghouse company

402
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,880
to be able to provide their type of

403
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
current again it wasn't a technological

404
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,800
war it was a political war

405
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,320
and we can see all these inventions

406
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,639
being politicized um the same with steel

407
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,279
production

408
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,519
mining um all the tolls that various

409
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,120
countries have placed on each other

410
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
the splendid isolationism of britain and

411
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
when it came to trade

412
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,079
the same that happened to america at the

413
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,000
start of the 20th century you can see

414
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
these things being massively manipulated

415
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,440
and of course then from them

416
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,519
come the social theories so marx and

417
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,120
engels they actually started working

418
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,839
um with the new rising um working class

419
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,959
in the uk where

420
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,720
you again started to have this friction

421
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,880
of like five-year-old kids working in

422
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,519
mines

423
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,519
but at the same time like they had to be

424
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,760
educated and like they couldn't do both

425
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,079
um and it like i've lived in the uk for

426
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,279
almost 10 years and the

427
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,120
level of social stratification that is

428
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,360
still um a result of the industrial

429
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,240
revolution

430
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
the difference is an accent depending on

431
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,519
what class you come from

432
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,120
the differences in education the

433
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,320
differences in where you go to

434
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,279
university

435
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,880
what you're called like if you're called

436
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
hugo automatically boom

437
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
done upper middle class finished like

438
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,480
it's really really interesting

439
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,680
anthropologically like

440
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
how these technologies like what a

441
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,720
profound effect they've had

442
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,000
on societies for centuries war and

443
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,079
weaponry um again this is uh hugely

444
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,440
interesting not just for the

445
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
sake of technological innovation but

446
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,279
also for the social change that this

447
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,560
usually precipitates

448
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,240
the reason i put napoleon there is

449
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,320
because actually the napoleonic wars

450
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
were fascinating when it came to um

451
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
setting up income tax in the uk so

452
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
before the napoleonic wars the uk

453
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,720
obviously a lot of colonies very happy

454
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,639
all awesome and then they realized that

455
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,839
they're running out of money because

456
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,120
napoleon was very

457
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,880
difficult to beat and that cost a lot of

458
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,560
cash um so they

459
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,040
imposed a very stratified and very um

460
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,440
systematic income tax on the population

461
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,199
but again like we see income taxes

462
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,639
something oh well that's always been

463
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,120
there

464
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,880
oh it hasn't it's really been there for

465
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,959
like 200 years and the reason is that

466
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,800
you couldn't really afford to pay for

467
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,079
wars anymore so

468
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,320
um and this then followed with various

469
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
things like the gold standard and

470
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
where the monetary system and the way

471
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
that the money is being extracted and

472
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
like transacted between

473
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,000
the society and the state has been

474
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,199
really artificial

475
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,199
and it has been dictated often by

476
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,040
singular events that have happened

477
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,199
um it of course also led to centralized

478
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,320
organization

479
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,600
redrawing of borders and my subject

480
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,519
archaeology anthropology um

481
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,760
people like radcliffe brown and foucault

482
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,519
and um levy strauss

483
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,760
they all started suddenly seeing society

484
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
as something to be scientifically

485
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,000
analyzed so

486
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,240
you had structuralism functionalism like

487
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,399
all these ideals of how society should

488
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,120
function

489
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,199
they're all pretty much but um

490
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,160
they're interesting to

491
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,680
think about and like that there are some

492
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,199
interesting parallels to be drawn from

493
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:35,760
them

494
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,839
but like for the last 100 years or so

495
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,839
what we've been almost seeing is like

496
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,240
eugenics on the society um where like

497
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,040
the ideal society and the ideal way but

498
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,399
how the transaction should happen

499
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,000
between the people and the state have

500
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,279
been analyzed in a really like

501
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,480
scientific like

502
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,639
darwinistic way and it's getting to a

503
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,760
stage where people are realizing that

504
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,360
that doesn't actually work that people

505
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,680
need

506
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,120
individual freedoms and that that's not

507
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,199
being catered for in this massive

508
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,399
diagram so

509
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,480
i'll get more uh to that um in a little

510
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,839
bit but it's just interesting to think

511
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
about

512
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,079
trade i mean the opium wars that they

513
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,040
were

514
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,279
fun um to say say the least um again

515
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,959
it's just the control of uh

516
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,800
precious materials again like the

517
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,079
technology that goes with that the

518
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,279
building of roads

519
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,360
the um scaling of your navy the the

520
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,639
scaling of your army

521
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,320
the scaling of your transportation

522
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,839
system like all of that

523
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,560
um like even just uh wells and fargo

524
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
which is the um still functioning

525
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,759
like ancient dhl of of uh united states

526
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,279
of america um

527
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,920
that was basically a very intricate web

528
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,560
network

529
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,240
that was used for trade and to deliver

530
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,399
post and it seems stupid but actually

531
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,680
technologically that is a really

532
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,240
interesting

533
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,440
thing to bear in mind again um

534
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
so oh there you go i pasted my name

535
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,720
three times there i look like an

536
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
egocentric maniac now

537
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,320
that that was an accident i assure you

538
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,000
um so this was actually

539
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
a really really funny moment when mccon

540
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
and theresa may i was running both their

541
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,480
campaigns at the time

542
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,759
um and that they were brexit was going

543
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,440
on and like no one had any idea what the

544
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,480
hell is going on

545
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,560
and then they thought huh you know what

546
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,320
we'll lend you the bio tapestry and you

547
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
can put it up in the british museum

548
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,759
and i was like what the hell is going on

549
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,600
like you're arguing over like a

550
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,320
900 year old piece of cloth like when

551
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
you should be discussing

552
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,720
more important things and this is me as

553
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,480
an archaeologist saying that but

554
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,959
actually

555
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,240
um it shows symbolically how like

556
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,279
culture film opera radio how all of

557
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,199
these things are hugely important and

558
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,880
their technologies in and of themselves

559
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,079
and they transfer really powerful

560
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,040
messages like

561
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,079
goebbels when he made radio very very uh

562
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,920
cheap and available to everyone and then

563
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,519
that meant that he could

564
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,120
happily stream the content that he

565
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,800
wanted into every single german

566
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,600
household

567
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,360
that was a turning point when in his

568
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,720
propaganda machine

569
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
similarly um for example mozart um he

570
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,040
hugely upset the

571
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
um austrian emperor at the time because

572
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,880
if you actually go to see don giovanni

573
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,360
or

574
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,079
marriage of figaro um there's a at the

575
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,000
end of don giovanni they have this aria

576
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,759
and it's like for liberty for liberty

577
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,160
and

578
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,359
he was a massive um like anti-statist

579
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,319
basically and

580
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,959
he was hugely unpopular due to that fact

581
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,599
and basically

582
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,039
he almost got kicked out of court for

583
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,880
that reason so all of these things that

584
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
we now take for granted as a part of

585
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,439
classical culture

586
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,799
they've always been technologies that

587
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,640
have been used for a very very um

588
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,760
specific point borders and

589
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,959
transportation um

590
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,880
again like the notion of borders seems

591
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,120
very natural to us the notion of nation

592
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,919
states

593
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,480
um again like italy that didn't get

594
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,640
unified until 1888 under victoria

595
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,600
emmanuel

596
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
he had the same with germany that got

597
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
unified under bismarck

598
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,440
austria hungary what the hell was going

599
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,120
on there doesn't even matter and what

600
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
the hell happened after like

601
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,679
we still had wars going on in the 90s of

602
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,400
like 1990s as a direct result of that

603
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,120
fact

604
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,360
britain they colonized the quarter of

605
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,320
the globe to like

606
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
great effect um and like all these

607
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,760
things have been hugely transient and

608
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,440
the notion of nation states has only

609
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,000
really been around for about 150 years

610
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,160
what i actually have here um i did

611
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,520
archaeological excavations

612
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,400
in um botswana and we were close to pond

613
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,600
drift and we came

614
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,559
up to this bit here and the reason it's

615
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,080
got such a peculiar

616
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,640
um kind of like semi-circle is because

617
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
cecil rhodes because this is zimbabwe

618
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,520
cecil rhodes

619
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,080
had a cannon here that had a 30 mile

620
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,720
radius

621
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,880
like this and there was infected cattle

622
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,840
in botswana

623
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,799
and so they literally drew the um border

624
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,000
of the state that is still

625
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,160
in effect so that the infected cattle

626
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,760
wouldn't go there because they'd be

627
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,679
shelled the out of by um cecil

628
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,520
rhodes so like all these things are

629
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,880
literally someone taking a pencil and

630
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,600
drawing on a map

631
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
something that we live our entire lives

632
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,559
by which is a little crazy sometimes

633
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,760
so from palantir to brexit my humble

634
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,720
story so

635
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,280
palantir i started working there in 2014

636
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,640
we're building up um

637
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,720
from the hr perspective that's where i

638
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,240
started because not many options for an

639
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
archaeologist who wants to go into tech

640
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,640
and change from month to month um we

641
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,400
were recruiting like a thousand people

642
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,080
for their london office it was crazy it

643
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,000
was really intense they were looking for

644
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,840
a thousand unicorns it's like okay good

645
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,360
luck with that that's that's

646
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,880
just not very scalable but fine fine um

647
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
and what was really interesting is that

648
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
they gave this like cryptic

649
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,760
image and like i would call up people

650
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,640
being like do you want to work for

651
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,919
palentine they're like no you're the

652
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,720
devil never

653
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,039
like i got that every day but it was

654
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,799
really interesting to see that basically

655
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,520
the um

656
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,320
concept of this company was to make um

657
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,760
customized software

658
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
for any problem that there is in the

659
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,280
world they wanted to solve all problems

660
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,400
that there are in the world using

661
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,200
software

662
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
what they are doing in fact is hugely

663
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,240
 and ineffective demos and gathering

664
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,440
a lot of data

665
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,840
and doing great pr while they were at it

666
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,640
um so the palantir um the symbol itself

667
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
is the seeing stone from

668
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,400
uh from lord of the rings um uh the one

669
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,280
that you know

670
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,039
saruman has that he like holds his hand

671
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,200
over that's what they were insinuating

672
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,280
they're not um public uh so they don't

673
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,400
um trade stock

674
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,919
so they're very very cryptic they had

675
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,080
some funding from the cia i.e a lot of

676
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,440
funding from the cia

677
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,600
but their pr image was much better than

678
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,360
what they actually did um 90

679
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,039
of their income came from their

680
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,720
financial product um

681
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,960
and they were doing some things like um

682
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,080
programming drones

683
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,840
to go against isis um and there were

684
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
some like interesting projects going on

685
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,679
but um it was really interesting

686
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,840
actually more than their actual

687
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
products to observe the psychology of

688
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
the company and we see this with these

689
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,679
huge technological giants like google

690
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,280
facebook um

691
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,200
palantir for that matter that you almost

692
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,440
get this state within a state develop

693
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,480
like the

694
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
rituals that happened there like alex

695
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,760
carp um who was the ceo

696
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
and i think he still is the ceo had this

697
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
like inner circle and that they all like

698
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,480
drank whiskeys on thursdays and like did

699
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,000
tai chi and it was like

700
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,480
really peculiar like they wouldn't share

701
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,000
information like with the outer circle

702
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,360
and they were very proud of that they're

703
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,000
like this

704
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,480
segmented like cryptic in a society and

705
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,679
um

706
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,320
it was just fascinating to see this new

707
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,440
class of

708
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,039
person almost emerging society um and

709
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,600
that is something uh that is just the

710
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,520
image versus reality is like

711
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,440
the the technological hype that is

712
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,120
around us um the fact that these

713
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,919
companies are

714
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,400
really taking over our minds with the

715
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
image that they kind of spread around

716
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,480
themselves

717
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,840
i think it's really important to bear in

718
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,600
mind that a lot of this um

719
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,520
fear that's being installed in us

720
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,600
there's not necessarily always a

721
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,440
real technological threat there's much

722
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
more of a psychological threat that they

723
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
seem like these cool problem solvers and

724
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,880
actually they're just taking a ton

725
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,840
of your data

726
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,000
um so this is something important to

727
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,600
bear in mind like the huge takeaway that

728
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,400
there was

729
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,200
from me um from this experience i then

730
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
went into nation builder nation builder

731
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,200
um

732
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,720
i had much more hands-on i was one of

733
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,159
the people opening up the london office

734
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,600
so there was literally three of us

735
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,400
i held like 40 50 different accounts um

736
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,080
as i said both sides of brexit um

737
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
several american presidential campaigns

738
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,000
french presidential campaigns some

739
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,840
albanian elections which was

740
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
crazy i'll tell you about that in a

741
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,159
second um well i say elections but you

742
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:00,559
know

743
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,120
um um but the interesting thing about

744
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
that is that the ceo jim gilliam who

745
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,039
sadly passed away from cancer

746
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,000
his dream was to um break up the

747
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,120
bipartisan

748
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,600
or the bi-party approach um in america

749
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,960
he was fed up with the fact that you're

750
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,720
either a democrat or a republican

751
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,480
and if you want to be an either you have

752
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,080
to spend an inordinate amount of money

753
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,360
like you have to be really really

754
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
wealthy or have

755
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,400
ridiculous connections from being

756
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,240
wealthy to to succeed

757
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,760
and what he basically said is that what

758
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,919
you need is a crm so database of

759
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,640
contacts

760
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
you need some kind of communication tool

761
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,159
you need to be able to raise finances

762
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,520
and you need to be able to

763
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,880
um uh sorry god what was the

764
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,440
oh yeah um i have a website sorry i just

765
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,880
forgot my own product that i like

766
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,080
spent three years working on um and the

767
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,120
combination of these

768
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
underneath one platform basically meant

769
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,720
that anyone for like the price of like

770
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,200
20

771
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
a month can actually gather a really

772
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,720
strong community about

773
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
and run for office that was the idea so

774
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
it was like democratizing democracy

775
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,320
democratizing politics

776
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,159
um the interesting thing was that was

777
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,080
non-partisan so unless the uh

778
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,679
it was criminal activity we'd work with

779
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,440
anyone so i worked with extreme

780
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,159
communists

781
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,080
to like extreme fascists it was

782
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,919
fascinating and it was the

783
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,520
time that i decided i was done with

784
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,600
politics forever because it was all

785
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,039
absolutely the same

786
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,440
um but the thing again that like struck

787
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,360
me most it wasn't that these

788
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
sinister entities it was that they're

789
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
absolutely useless

790
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
absolutely useless like i would come to

791
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,200
the head of i.t of a major party that

792
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,640
had a database of like two and a half

793
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,280
million

794
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,520
and they'd barely know how to use excel

795
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,559
it was it was

796
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,280
so bad um the democrats in the u.s they

797
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,760
have this

798
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
ancient system called ngp van which is

799
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,679
basically like this lobby system and

800
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,360
they have to use only that

801
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,039
it looks terrible you can't connect

802
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,720
anything to the api is pretty much

803
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,840
non-existent

804
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,760
and even the candidates are saying look

805
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,799
you're not actually giving us the

806
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,559
technological tools to succeed i'm not

807
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,080
even talking about like the levels of

808
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,960
encryption

809
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,200
or not like lack of that that happened

810
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,760
there um so again like the threat

811
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,000
like the state um you know we see it as

812
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
like this

813
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,320
like oh my god there's a huge thing

814
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,080
above us but they're useless

815
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,159
they're absolutely useless i didn't come

816
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,919
across a single party where i'd think

817
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,799
wow okay

818
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,480
you guys know what you're doing it was

819
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,159
holding their hands having a call with

820
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,520
them three times a week

821
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,679
like i remember one unnamed french

822
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,039
presidential candidate

823
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,000
they they used to send i kid you not

824
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,919
five times a week to their entire

825
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:24,799
database

826
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,799
an email that long about what that

827
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,480
candidate is going to be doing that week

828
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,880
like

829
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,320
oh he's going to have a baguette it's

830
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,480
like who cares like why are you not

831
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,840
segmenting your data because like

832
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,200
there's a group of your voters that are

833
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,240
interested in a

834
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,640
and a group that's like interested in b

835
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,000
you're not using that data at all you're

836
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,919
just like blasting your database

837
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,080
you don't care about like if your ip

838
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,679
address is warm like you've given up on

839
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,200
that you don't even know what an ip is

840
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,760
but um

841
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,799
it was just it was just really hard work

842
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,320
um and i think that actually scares me

843
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,200
the most because

844
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
we're not talking about ai anymore we're

845
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,600
talking about massive amounts of data

846
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,039
being in the hands of people who are

847
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,480
absolutely incompetent and that's

848
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,279
actually i think a huge threat

849
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,080
um so oh this was i gotta tell you about

850
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,919
the um albanian election so basically i

851
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,360
flew to albania

852
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,080
um and i came there um and no no one

853
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,360
turned up i was meant to train them up

854
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,720
on the system no one turned up until

855
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,880
like noon women to start like eight but

856
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,679
fine

857
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,760
um and then they turned up and like they

858
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
were like they want vodka i was like no

859
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
no no vodka like please let's just like

860
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,720
do some work

861
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,480
um and the first thing that they did is

862
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,880
they sat down and they were like

863
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,960
we want the database of like the rival

864
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,200
party i was like um excuse me

865
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,440
like okay no they're like no no we want

866
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,799
the database you don't understand how it

867
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,600
works it's like

868
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,039
i don't care how it works here i know

869
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,640
how it works in international law and

870
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,000
like data privacy i'm not giving

871
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,880
you a database so they bungled me into

872
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,960
mercedes with blacked out windows

873
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,799
drove me into the albanian mountains

874
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,159
poured me some red wine

875
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,320
gave me literally like half a sheep to

876
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,159
eat and they're like you'll give us that

877
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,000
database i was like look you bribing me

878
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,840
with roast cheap is not gonna make me

879
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,520
give you your date like just no that's

880
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,720
not gonna happen

881
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,400
so they tried for about four hours and

882
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,760
they're like okay she's not giving us

883
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,279
the database i'm like okay

884
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,520
like same time same place tomorrow or

885
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,039
like what's gonna happen

886
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,960
um but like it was hilarious in that for

887
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,480
example their canvassing or their

888
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,679
campaigning was that they

889
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,080
used to go door-to-door pretending that

890
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,919
they're like a dog charity

891
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,200
and they used to collect really

892
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,120
sensitive information about the people

893
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
they bought everyone on the campaign

894
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,559
trail a tablet they're all entering like

895
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,520
their addresses

896
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,600
emails social media but they'd pretend

897
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
they're like raising money for dogs

898
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,919
and it was just like what like how's

899
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,520
this working and

900
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,240
again you just realize that like the

901
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,159
state does not have its together

902
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,240
and like i saw this all over the world

903
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,799
um

904
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,120
and obviously there's details i can't go

905
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,200
into because of an nda but like

906
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,600
trust me like if they then they don't

907
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,279
know what they're doing

908
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,679
um and that brings me on to the myth of

909
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,960
ai so

910
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,320
i think the biggest myth is that we've

911
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
got strong ai or like artificial general

912
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,600
intelligence

913
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,039
there's several people who claim they

914
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,440
have it like open ai deepmind um there's

915
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,960
several startups popping up that they're

916
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,679
really close

917
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,440
we're not close because if we were close

918
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
if we already had it that person would

919
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,720
literally control the globe

920
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,799
and that that's that's not happening um

921
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,799
again they're very advanced

922
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,039
very useful fantastic statistical

923
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,240
analytical models

924
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,159
but that whole like cambridge analytica

925
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,279
spiel of

926
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,600
they ran a secret algorithm on your data

927
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,039
and now they're winning elections and

928
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,399
you don't know how

929
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,159
 no that's that's not how it

930
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,320
works and i'll get to that in a second

931
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,080
again the state is competently and

932
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,679
cleverly using your data and feeding it

933
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,360
into sophisticated algorithms

934
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,159
no they've got unencrypted databases um

935
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:38,640
pavel

936
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,480
actually like you know a few weeks back

937
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,919
when the slack in

938
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,679
ministry of health just left like 400

939
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,600
000 records lying there with people's

940
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,520
diagnosis and emails and numbers

941
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,960
they're not constantly using your data

942
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,039
they're just collecting it or people are

943
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,919
not

944
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,600
educated enough about where their data

945
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,880
is going and they're just sending it off

946
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
to giants like facebook and google

947
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,320
and just by searching and google you're

948
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
already leaving behind a massive

949
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,600
digital map of who you are and we're

950
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,120
giving that data away like it was

951
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,440
worthless um think of it if we had like

952
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,520
a golden mine or a lithium mine

953
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,120
we wouldn't just give that away like we

954
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,799
would have trade walls over that

955
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,360
but we're happy to basically send all of

956
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,000
our data to

957
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,480
like for example american servers do

958
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,080
whatever you want with it and say yeah

959
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,159
sure have my data have my grandma's data

960
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,520
i have everything and we're not

961
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,559
realizing that

962
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,399
it's that incompetence in the middle

963
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,399
where it's being lost and leaked and

964
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,000
um used in very various ways

965
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,320
also elections are swayed by fake news

966
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,440
and deep manipulation

967
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,520
they're not um one thing that really

968
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,000
makes me angry is that

969
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
by the media especially people are being

970
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,000
portrayed as dumb and stupid they don't

971
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
know what they're voting for

972
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,720
that's not true i actually don't think

973
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,559
that the voters are

974
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,760
dumb sheep um of course in a way humans

975
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,240
are

976
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,919
but this has been a rhetoric that's been

977
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,840
really played up lately and it's not the

978
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,399
case

979
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,880
you cannot have an election won solely

980
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,600
by the fact

981
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,840
um that you're going to like generate a

982
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,880
sexy piece of

983
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,159
like fake news by an ai algorithm first

984
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,799
even the gpt3 model from openai is not

985
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,240
going to generate a piece of

986
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,000
like fake news good enough for anyone to

987
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,520
actually believe it at scale

988
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,399
but secondly people are pissed off and

989
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,840
they're they're voting for an option

990
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,120
that's going to shake things up

991
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,559
they don't necessarily believe in trump

992
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,880
or brexit but they're using that vote as

993
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
a last resort of that their

994
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
absolute and utter frustration to be

995
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
able to do something to the system they

996
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,000
don't actually care if it's bad

997
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,520
they just want to do something to the

998
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,039
system because the status quo

999
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,640
is really leaving them like dying um

1000
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
cool oh five minutes okay that'll be

1001
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,720
interesting i'll speed through it

1002
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,399
and finally that artificial intelligence

1003
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,840
is a threat to democracy

1004
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,679
no artificial intelligence and

1005
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,760
technology in general if used well

1006
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,159
is the true democracy that we can have

1007
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,919
um it's the

1008
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,000
inability to work with data properly um

1009
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,159
that is the real threat to democracy

1010
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,200
um so the examples of ai um in state

1011
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,159
purposes

1012
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,159
um we can see it in from everything like

1013
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,919
facial recognition and crime

1014
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,480
to um things like data-driven populism

1015
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,760
so actually making

1016
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
policies based on what you think people

1017
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,080
might like um the generation of fake

1018
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,520
news to a certain extent

1019
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,360
predicting votes that's what is being

1020
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,039
used for quite a lot of the time

1021
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,679
and often incredibly badly um the thing

1022
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:20,799
that the states are worried about most

1023
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,640
moses of course uh cost reduction and

1024
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,120
the

1025
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,480
um replacing of bureaucracy by ai

1026
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,600
because it make things a lot more

1027
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,320
transparent

1028
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,159
you can't hide things so much and also

1029
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,360
you don't need so much of the human

1030
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,399
workforce so

1031
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,919
i think that that's where the current

1032
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,760
block is lying

1033
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,159
now cambridge analytica the big ai hoax

1034
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,760
they actually made a lot of money and a

1035
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,440
lot of good pr by pretending

1036
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,520
that they can analyze psychometric data

1037
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,120
that they know exactly who you are

1038
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
who you vote how you vote i've seen the

1039
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,799
algorithms i've seen the technology i've

1040
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,159
worked with some of it i was not part of

1041
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,679
cambridge analytica but obviously i was

1042
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,240
in that

1043
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,039
crew at the time gdpr was coming in and

1044
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,880
again no it was just facebook

1045
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,559
sharing its data lazily and it was

1046
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,640
someone saying okay i see a vague

1047
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,919
correlation between

1048
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,760
this demographic and then voting

1049
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
conservative or labor

1050
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,200
or like vote or leave um so sorry vote

1051
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,480
leave or remain

1052
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,919
it wasn't anything sophisticated it was

1053
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,200
like it was pretty much linear

1054
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
regression and clustering it wasn't

1055
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,679
anything great

1056
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,799
but again what that led to is and i'm

1057
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,159
not going to read all of this because it

1058
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:18,720
would make me

1059
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,640
throw up but this guy called lord

1060
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,720
clement jones who's like 150

1061
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,840
said right okay cambridge analytica bad

1062
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,600
news everyone ai is controlling the

1063
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,159
world

1064
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,080
so we've got these regulations that we

1065
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,279
need to put in and

1066
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,679
i mean the autonomous power to hurt

1067
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,559
destroy

1068
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,640
or deceive human beings should never be

1069
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,240
vested in artificial intelligence what

1070
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,919
does that even mean like artificial

1071
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,200
intelligence is not some

1072
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,799
robot sitting there twiddling his

1073
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,320
fingers thinking oh yeah

1074
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
i'm gonna i'm gonna destroy these guys

1075
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,240
i'm gonna like sway the vote this way

1076
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,399
no it's just statistics and like these

1077
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,919
regulations are regulating something

1078
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,279
that doesn't even exist

1079
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,880
and like what that's then doing is

1080
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
completely stamping on the innovation on

1081
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,840
people like you

1082
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,760
who want to start companies who want to

1083
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,840
innovate who want to change the world

1084
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,039
and it's not allowing you to do that

1085
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,480
because the regulation is coming from a

1086
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,399
bunch of guys who've read something in a

1087
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:06,960
paper

1088
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,559
they don't really understand it anyway

1089
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,399
and boom bob's your uncle suddenly

1090
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,679
you're not allowed to start a company

1091
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,080
and that's just crazy

1092
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,919
so what should we do instead um

1093
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,399
education education education exactly

1094
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,679
basically what is happening here at

1095
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:20,799
parallel neapolis

1096
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,240
i don't want to go into it in too much

1097
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,840
depth because i don't have much time but

1098
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,519
i think you get the gist of what i'm

1099
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,519
saying um the the demand of this needs

1100
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,440
to go from the grassroots up it needs to

1101
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,320
come from the kid

1102
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,000
and the average person in the street

1103
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
that we demand to be educated about

1104
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,919
latest trends latest technology

1105
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,120
and like what is what the hell is

1106
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,240
actually going on and what's happening

1107
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,559
with our data

1108
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,799
so the vision of the future i'm almost

1109
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,320
ending

1110
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
um so i think that the nation's states

1111
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,760
are at an end um i don't think that

1112
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,559
that's a

1113
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,880
model that can last much longer because

1114
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,399
the demands of the population of what

1115
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,320
the state needs to provide is vastly

1116
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,760
outgrowing what the state can actually

1117
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,640
provide back

1118
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,240
mainly because the states have become so

1119
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,960
complicated and just so fatty

1120
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,240
there's going to be an increase in

1121
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,840
autonomous and independent groups so i

1122
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
genuinely believe that parallel nepalese

1123
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,640
is a

1124
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,399
first step in the domino that's going to

1125
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,000
change the way society works

1126
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,440
i think we're going to revert back to

1127
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,120
almost like tribal

1128
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,039
way of being where we organize small

1129
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,880
groups based on beliefs and

1130
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,120
based on certain needs and we're going

1131
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,640
to like start all over again

1132
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,120
i think in a lot of ways um there's

1133
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,880
going to be a few high-profile trials

1134
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,480
and hoaxes so there's going to be like

1135
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,440
the watergate of ai um gdpr is such a

1136
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,960
fuzzy legislation that no one knows what

1137
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
the hell is going on again i was there

1138
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,159
working in politics when it came into

1139
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,120
play and

1140
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,360
boy was that like we were meant to give

1141
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,039
advice to our political clients about

1142
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:39,679
gdpr

1143
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,600
like no one had any idea like like we

1144
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,039
didn't know they're like oh

1145
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,960
do we have a two-factor authentication

1146
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
like i mean

1147
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,919
yeah if you want to be on the safe side

1148
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,440
but does it actually explicitly say

1149
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,640
anywhere so it was

1150
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,919
really really tough and i think that

1151
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,840
there will be a few um politically

1152
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,320
driven

1153
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,880
trials to that effect um and there's

1154
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,399
going to be a concrete breaking point

1155
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,440
because the

1156
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,880
um the weights between society

1157
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,559
and the state and like the average

1158
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,000
person and the individual

1159
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,560
and the state is becoming really tense

1160
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,839
because of the technology that's making

1161
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,839
everything faster more transparent and

1162
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,040
that tension is going to break um

1163
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,199
societies go through a i mean this can

1164
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,879
be disputed by certain academics but go

1165
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,000
through cycles

1166
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,560
i think that we're roughly here we're

1167
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,320
not going to necessarily have a war or a

1168
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,760
bloody revolution

1169
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,440
but we're going to have a political

1170
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
restructuring um new world order is

1171
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,159
maybe a bit

1172
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,719
too weird and illuminati-esque but um

1173
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,560
we're at that change um

1174
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,320
the system that we live in now i believe

1175
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,079
is going to break

1176
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,399
um and finally um we're going to be

1177
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,159
living as a dense network

1178
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,599
in a much more globalized world we're

1179
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,599
going to connect in communities

1180
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,440
and the creation of communities that

1181
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,960
exist in something like of like parallel

1182
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,239
nepalese is not something that the

1183
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,760
states are designed to deal with

1184
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,679
and i think that that's going to be um

1185
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,480
an increasing tension there as well

1186
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,720
so thank you so much and remember that

1187
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,240
you should dare to disrupt because the

1188
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,599
status quo that we're in

1189
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:16,320
is only imaginary so thank you okay

1190
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,359
okay okay so thank you sarah thank you

1191
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,079
nice presentation very interesting uh so

1192
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,040
i prepared some

1193
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,720
questions just in case we don't have

1194
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,240
enough from the audience

1195
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,200
i haven't seen any in the chat so in the

1196
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,680
room

1197
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,800
just raise your hand and uh okay

1198
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,040
cool

1199
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:45,680
do we have an extra one okay

1200
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,680
uh what is your view on the like uh

1201
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,320
chinese communist party and their social

1202
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,560
credit score system are they just as

1203
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,400
technologically incompetent as as

1204
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,000
western politicians it's it's a really

1205
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,440
good point i'm probably going to say

1206
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,119
something hugely

1207
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,280
unpopular here but i think that the

1208
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,119
china versus the west rhetoric that's

1209
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,640
being blown up

1210
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,160
is um i think there's a

1211
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,839
very deliberate purpose in which way

1212
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,599
that is being communicated in the media

1213
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,320
um

1214
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,400
uh on the other hand atrocities like

1215
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,680
what is happening in hong kong is

1216
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,400
something that

1217
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,240
needs to be dealt with china that the

1218
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,599
problem is that they're um

1219
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,599
almost eerily efficient and they've got

1220
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,720
a hold of that data

1221
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,040
but no one else has so what i'm

1222
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,480
advocating for is the data to be

1223
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,079
distributed in almost like an open

1224
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,599
source way and for the people to know

1225
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,960
exactly where it's going

1226
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,640
um what's happening in china is that a

1227
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,320
huge amount of data is being collected

1228
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,400
but it's going into one database that a

1229
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
very centralized group of people is um

1230
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,320
basically monopolizing so it's an

1231
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,599
equivalent of

1232
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,480
um i don't know some some guy coming and

1233
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,920
taking all of our mobile phones and

1234
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,960
putting them into

1235
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,480
bank vault somewhere and like no one has

1236
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,320
any access to mobile phones like is

1237
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,200
hoarding of a very um precious um

1238
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,240
commodity

1239
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,040
um so i think that the way that it's not

1240
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,640
decentralized and the fact that it's

1241
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,280
controlled

1242
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,599
is incredibly eerie from a technological

1243
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,400
perspective

1244
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,119
like if those were the nice guys it's

1245
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,960
almost fascinating because like it can

1246
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,320
lead to things like predictive health

1247
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,680
care right because like if they

1248
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,760
if i go to the doctor and they can for

1249
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,680
example say okay like you're allergic to

1250
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,000
this

1251
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
kind of stuff you should have this type

1252
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,440
of diet you should have this type of

1253
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
medicine and it means that i live for 20

1254
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,640
years longer great

1255
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,560
i want them to have that data but i want

1256
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,760
them to have that trust

1257
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,800
i won't have that trust that they're

1258
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,480
dealing with it properly but it all

1259
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,000
comes down to the fact that we can i

1260
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,680
don't think that we can ever trust

1261
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,720
a state to deal with data in a proper

1262
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,000
way like because to assume that the

1263
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,119
state is going to be good

1264
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,119
is naive so we need to come up with a

1265
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,160
way where um

1266
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
data is being traded in like an i think

1267
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,240
almost open source very transparent way

1268
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
and i think that that's the only way

1269
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,680
forward um otherwise like we're always

1270
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,119
only a step away from

1271
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,359
regimes like china but also one last

1272
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,400
thing to think

1273
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,920
that western countries are not doing

1274
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,760
similar atrocities with data like

1275
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,720
china is also would be naive

1276
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,560
okay we have one more question over here

1277
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,839
i hope that answered your question by

1278
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,880
the way

1279
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,079
yeah awesome is this on

1280
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,760
it is good so um i really enjoyed your

1281
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,560
presentation i

1282
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
am i should thank you very much i would

1283
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,240
love to talk about capitalism

1284
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,599
really and the way it's basically eating

1285
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,359
itself i would like to know if you're

1286
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,800
aware of the

1287
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,280
jeremy rifkin conference that went viral

1288
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,599
about the sharing economy to know like

1289
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,079
his work are you aware of like

1290
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,880
the the tracing basically about the

1291
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,720
transformation the big transformation in

1292
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,520
economics starting if you go back like

1293
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,839
about 200 years or so with uh the first

1294
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,280
and the second revolution

1295
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,000
and the third one basically where

1296
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,240
decentralization is supposedly key

1297
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,800
and in his if you if you look at his

1298
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,680
work it's

1299
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,320
it sounds like very eutopic in a way

1300
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,880
like in

1301
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,119
utopia even though he would argue

1302
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,200
actually that sharing economy is sort of

1303
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,200
sort of like a a child of capitalism and

1304
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,520
having the technology a good enough

1305
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,240
technology

1306
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,000
to produce go goods and services at near

1307
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,520
zero marginal cost

1308
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,200
it's something that is already happening

1309
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,640
and it's supposedly

1310
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,359
allowing us to take that control of

1311
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,800
ourselves

1312
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,520
right so the sharing economy basically

1313
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,200
and the possibilities of the near zero

1314
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,079
marginal cost

1315
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,200
society yeah oh that's a fantastic

1316
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,880
question and i we need to chat after

1317
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,839
this um

1318
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,160
because that i would bore everyone to

1319
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,960
death but um

1320
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,040
um actually like the notion of um

1321
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,960
trading and reciprocity is like deeply

1322
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,160
um it's actually one of the things that

1323
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,200
makes us human um

1324
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,240
so muscle mos in his um book ledong

1325
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,320
already spoke about um for example at

1326
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,359
christmas you know

1327
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,200
it seems like you buy for example a

1328
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,800
present for your grandma or your mom

1329
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,320
but actually the amount of rituals

1330
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,440
around that and like the way that you

1331
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,720
can measure it through data

1332
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,560
how much you spend on certain people and

1333
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,079
like what cards you sent to everyone

1334
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,680
it's a hugely ritualized process and i

1335
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,200
think that can be extrapolated into

1336
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,400
society in general

1337
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,920
and we're seeing some of those trends i

1338
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,079
think in the um um

1339
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,040
cryptocurrency space um where exactly

1340
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,160
that kind of sentiment is being

1341
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,200
replicated

1342
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,440
um and like of course like money and the

1343
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,319
value of money

1344
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,920
it's completely fake like i've lived in

1345
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,359
a lot of different countries and like

1346
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,040
even just the notion of an exchange rate

1347
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,319
based on the fact that it's not based on

1348
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,599
the golden standard anymore it's

1349
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,720
basically based on

1350
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,200
a fluctuating market that in itself is

1351
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,800
completely artificial

1352
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,079
um it's it's all i think a

1353
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,520
capitalism has basically become

1354
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,160
something for um people who believe that

1355
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,079
they believe in freedom to cling on to

1356
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,560
and they can't let go um and for example

1357
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,280
one of the

1358
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,040
big arguments that has been used in the

1359
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,400
uk where i lived which is where i have

1360
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,440
my experience from

1361
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,280
was the privatization of industry and

1362
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,720
railways during the margaret thatcher

1363
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,280
years

1364
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
and they were saying oh for example the

1365
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,960
railways they're privatized now yes

1366
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,760
capitalism

1367
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,680
but actually like in that specific case

1368
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,960
you've got two railway

1369
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,800
lines running down the country so that's

1370
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,040
not a market that's an oligopoly um

1371
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,640
it has got nothing to do with capitalism

1372
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
but because we've become so tribalized

1373
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,560
and so obsessed with politics

1374
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,640
the whole notion of rational and

1375
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,079
critical thought has completely gone out

1376
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,520
of the window so everything's become

1377
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,160
really like

1378
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,240
cartesian dualistic and what i think

1379
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
that we need to encourage and what's

1380
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,960
going to help a shared economy which i

1381
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,760
support

1382
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,680
um is just critical thought and being

1383
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,280
able to say like look

1384
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,359
i might be more right wing but actually

1385
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,400
in this sense

1386
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,920
nationalizing this makes a lot more

1387
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,680
sense and that discourse is not

1388
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,200
happening at all right now we're having

1389
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
people argue over face masks

1390
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,720
you know like it's it's crazy like

1391
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,319
people politicize anything and

1392
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,000
the environment's really toxic and i

1393
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,200
think that the transparency of

1394
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,400
technology can help

1395
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,920
kick off that much-needed debate okay

1396
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,599
thank you uh i'm going to be a bit

1397
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,200
selfish i have a question

1398
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,319
yeah sure okay so given uh

1399
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,599
malicious or incompetent incompetent

1400
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,680
organizations with tons of data

1401
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,680
how does an autonomous group defend

1402
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,359
itself or

1403
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,520
let's say in an offensive or defensive

1404
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,560
way against

1405
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,240
those organizations it's well and you'll

1406
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,800
find out

1407
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,520
during this congress it's a really good

1408
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,960
question and i think that there should

1409
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,319
be like a basic

1410
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,040
um to-do list um that everyone should

1411
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,760
learn from

1412
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,400
like primary school like how to do your

1413
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,079
taxes and things like that which is not

1414
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,280
taught in school at all

1415
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,640
god knows how i still don't know how to

1416
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,599
do them um but what data even is

1417
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,520
like where it's stored like what a

1418
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,440
server is versus the cloud versus a

1419
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,480
hybrid system

1420
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,720
um how data is being transferred what

1421
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,400
data like what kind of like digital

1422
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,079
presence you leave online like when i

1423
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,319
what i when i remember how i behaved on

1424
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,920
facebook when i was like 15.

1425
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,920
like i dread to think like what is out

1426
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,119
there with like some of my crazy

1427
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,640
comments or like even private messages

1428
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,240
to friends that i know that can be

1429
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,280
uh spied on on any time um so just like

1430
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,560
the demystification

1431
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,960
of data is not just something random

1432
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,200
that's like going to go to some nice guy

1433
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,040
over in a nice server and a nice like

1434
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,800
big silicon valley company

1435
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,640
to realize the huge threat and the huge

1436
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,480
value of it is only going to be achieved

1437
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
through education public workshops

1438
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,720
um and but that we can't expect that of

1439
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,839
the state so we need to do that

1440
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,359
ourselves

1441
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,160
okay thank you uh we have time for one

1442
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,720
more question

1443
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
okay

1444
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,400
on the subject of demystifying data i

1445
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,160
was at a conference a while ago and

1446
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,680
someone told the story

1447
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,520
of during the german reunification

1448
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,480
there was a debate whether the u.s

1449
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,319
intelligence agencies

1450
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,640
should continue have a legal right to

1451
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,960
access all the telecommunications data

1452
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,440
in germany which they had while germany

1453
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,880
was split

1454
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,800
and the german chancellor at the time

1455
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,319
didn't really have an opinion on this

1456
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:42,800
and was

1457
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,000
quite okay to have it continue until

1458
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,440
some of his aides

1459
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,000
wheeled a large cart into his office

1460
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,920
stacked with thousands and thousands and

1461
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,240
thousands of sheets of paper

1462
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,960
and he asked what is this and they

1463
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,400
explained to him these are all

1464
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,319
your telephone conversations that were

1465
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,920
recorded by the stasi

1466
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,240
which we just got from the jazzy records

1467
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,680
office which had been newly created at

1468
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,880
the time

1469
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,119
and as soon as he saw that he realized

1470
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,720
the importance

1471
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,000
of this data that he was about to sign

1472
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,040
over

1473
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,839
and he decided that maybe we should not

1474
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:18,640
continue

1475
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,200
letting everyone access our data because

1476
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,880
when he saw it concretely what the

1477
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,640
implications were

1478
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,680
then he understood unfortunately we

1479
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,599
don't have the liberty of doing this for

1480
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,280
everybody on the planet

1481
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,640
so how can we concretize the importance

1482
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,720
of data to people uh without simply

1483
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,319
showing them their records

1484
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,520
from the nsa or whatever yeah i mean

1485
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,920
um so i remember back back in

1486
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,760
westminster and that's a really

1487
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,280
excellent point by the way um

1488
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,880
and back back in westminster there used

1489
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,560
to be the culture of spin doctors where

1490
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,200
they would

1491
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,839
uh use various leaks so one of my

1492
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,760
friends actually now runs the um

1493
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,839
entire campaign for for boris johnson

1494
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,599
and the whole like crisis covet

1495
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,680
covert response um it's the company

1496
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,200
topham gurin and like some of the

1497
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,000
stories that he tells

1498
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,319
me are just just insane but actually i

1499
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,839
think that the state is a great way to

1500
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,520
demonstrate that to show off

1501
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,760
like david cameron's private text to

1502
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,560
someone

1503
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,319
i actually think is a really good way to

1504
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,319
show look like they're incompetent we

1505
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,440
can easily hack this

1506
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,200
and if it can happen to david cameron it

1507
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,200
can happen to you um i think that's a

1508
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
really like nice educational way without

1509
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,560
actually endangering

1510
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,400
individual freedom of people who did not

1511
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,160
ask to be exposed in this way

1512
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,079
um so the culture of leaking happens

1513
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,599
there a lot but currently it's done by

1514
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,640
people who are not hugely

1515
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,920
technologically savvy

1516
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,680
it's usually done when someone gets

1517
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,280
drunk somewhere says something racist

1518
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,560
they take a video of it and then they

1519
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,760
blackmail them over it

1520
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,240
but i think that it's now turning this

1521
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,079
culture is turning into um

1522
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,760
actually hacking the other opponent's

1523
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,000
systems and leaking data so i remember

1524
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,440
on the vote leaf campaign

1525
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,079
the day after the campaign finished um

1526
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,520
all the data went missing someone

1527
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,640
exported it

1528
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,720
and like it's still i believe it's still

1529
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,680
an ongoing um

1530
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,000
thing um it's got some kind of legal

1531
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,119
repercussions but

1532
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,800
to actually like write about that

1533
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
explicitly by some independent

1534
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,480
media that is not being controlled by

1535
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,720
one party or another this technological

1536
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,319
watchdog i think that should be there

1537
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,440
and they should

1538
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,920
every time in a very bombastic way like

1539
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,280
pavel did with the um

1540
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,960
ministry of health in slovakia to show

1541
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,880
look they left this data lying around

1542
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,400
they left their private records lying

1543
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:20,960
around

1544
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,800
and i think through this storytelling to

1545
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,400
show how incorporated the state is you

1546
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,920
kill two birds with one stone

1547
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,359
you show how incompetent they are with

1548
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,200
their own data and how incompetent they

1549
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
are with your data by proxy and i think

1550
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,079
that would be a very

1551
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,599
um helpful narrative okay

1552
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,920
so that's all the time we have for q a

1553
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,200
thank you again

1554
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,920
and uh so setup i like thank you

1555
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,319

1556
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:57,759
