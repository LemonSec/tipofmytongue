1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,720
all right

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,480
so we're talking about insanely great

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,160
and i'll try to go a little bit fast

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,800
here

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
um the phrase insanely great comes from

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,160
i borrowed from steve jobs

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,160
i thought his products while very clever

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,760
didn't rise to that standard but the

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,560
cypherpunk totality does

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,279
and if you you'll see i have to give mr

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,119
jobs a little bit of credit

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,800
he and mr wozniak were actual hackers at

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,439
one time

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,960
unlike the other big computer guys

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,559
here in this picture building something

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,239
called a blue box

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,440
a blue box was

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,879
a device for hacking the telephone

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:45,840
system

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,920
uh it allowed you to make free phone

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,600
calls and these that was their first

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
product not a computer it was a hacker

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,480
tool

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
so credit words do and uh that brings us

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,440
into

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,480
the hacking

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,879
as it existed before the computer and

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,239
here you see their magazine

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,720
2600 the hackers quarterly which still

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
exists by the way

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,960
so these are the kind of people that

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
became cypherpunks if you go to the next

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
slide you'll see

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,960
one of the first images anybody saw of

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,560
the cypherpunks

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,439
on the left is timothy c may then eric

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,240
hughes

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,360
and then john gilmore and there was a

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,799
lot of overflow from

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,079
the telephone hackers now i want to

42
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,079
explain to you a little bit about these

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,880
people

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,960
uh if you go to the next slide you'll

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,920
see

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
uh what the mailing list looked like in

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,960
the beginning it was

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,479
very simple it was just

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,759
a news group list and this was very very

50
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,920
early internet

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,439
but you know it was a really wonderful

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,320
format for us we we communicated about a

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,640
lot of things in surprising depth

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,840
it was actually a terrific forum for us

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,880
now let's talk about in the next slide

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
what i call the discoverers of terra

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,079
nova

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,119
and that is these early

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,000
cypherpunks realized they were onto

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
something unique in the history of the

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,879
world

62
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,879
or at least in the recent history of the

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,959
world they had this new network the

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,840
internet

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,280
which was censorship resistant

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
there was no gatekeeper anyone who was

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
connected to this thing could

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,840
communicate

69
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
and it was a tremendously interesting

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,440
realm

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,800
and then we realized

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,319
that we had encryption strong encryption

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,080
was coming around at that time and then

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,239
we got this thing called diffie hillman

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,080
key exchange

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,440
and it allowed us to share our keys with

77
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,000
the whole

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
world prior to that if you wanted to

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,400
have encryption you had to very secretly

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,519
share the key

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,840
because there was only one key and

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,959
anybody

83
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,200
who got it could read everything you

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,040
said you couldn't just send it over the

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,080
network

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,800
with our new public key cryptography you

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,440
could

88
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,120
so all of a sudden here we are and we've

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,599
got

90
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,480
a new realm and we've got walls we can

91
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,920
put around it

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,560
that we can be private that we can have

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
this new realm where nobody can tell us

94
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,440
what to do

95
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
where we can build what we want where we

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,799
can be what we want

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,640
that was a revelation and

98
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,239
that was when people said

99
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,280
what do we have here what can we build

100
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,080
here

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,599
what should we build here and if you'll

102
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,239
see

103
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,159
on this slide the one i have entitled

104
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,720
the discoverers of terra nova

105
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,799
i try to explain to you a little bit of

106
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,640
who these people were

107
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,000
now i'm not going to be fair about this

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,120
but this is the way it was

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,040
i'm not going to be complete about it i

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,400
should say

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,640
these were people who had a non-hostile

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,760
view of life

113
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,599
who didn't think life sucked and then

114
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,040
you die who thought that you could

115
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
actually do something in the world

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,000
uh they had expectations of excellence

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,519
and they were willing to pay the price

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,280
for excellence

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,160
so and i give their parents credit for

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,279
this probably

121
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,759
uh but that's the kind of assumptions

122
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,560
these people

123
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
had we also had people who believed in

124
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,320
honesty and fair dealing

125
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,639
we it really we believed in the golden

126
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,080
rule although we didn't really talk

127
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,759
about the golden rules i don't remember

128
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,960
it very much

129
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,440
but if you wanted to discredit yourself

130
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,160
you

131
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,600
did to somebody else what you wouldn't

132
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,759
like them to do to you

133
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,919
these people did not respect power and

134
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,199
prestige

135
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,160
that just wasn't part of the game they

136
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,199
believed in reason

137
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,800
and evidence we were really educated

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,080
by nasa and the hippies the hippies

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,040
were non-conformist i mean that's if

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,199
non-conformist is really the essence of

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,840
being a hippie in those days

142
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,520
uh and we grew up on that

143
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,120
i did and i know a lot of the other

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,400
people who were in the list in the

145
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
beginning some of them were pretty young

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,639
but

147
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,000
we grew up with this kind of

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,759
non-conformist as the way we are and

149
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,160
we're going to be

150
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,639
also nasa you have to understand what it

151
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,759
was like

152
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,360
to be in the 1960s watching spaceships

153
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,039
go up into space for the first time in

154
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,800
human history

155
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
it was an incredible experience uh

156
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
if i could give you a pill to that you

157
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,400
could feel that trust me i would it was

158
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,000
an incredible time

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
and this is the kind of ideas that we

160
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,400
had in our heads

161
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
these were people who needed a refuge or

162
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,639
a playground for their minds

163
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,039
now i'm telling you these people's

164
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,120
virtues there were also all sorts of

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
goofiness that went on that this was not

166
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
a collection of pure

167
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,919
saints uh these people sometimes argued

168
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,080
sometimes we're stupid sometimes we're

169
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
vain there was one point where the list

170
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,120
got

171
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
so disruptive that sandy sanford

172
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,039
had to moderate it for a few months

173
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,960
until things calmed down

174
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,639
um and the cypherpunks list was

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,039
all right let me get back to where i was

176
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,280
so

177
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,880
cypherpunks and in who these people were

178
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,919
um with all of their usual

179
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,639
human problems these are the assumptions

180
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,080
that they made that they

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,039
embedded in code so let's go to the next

182
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,800
slide

183
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
this just to give you an idea this is

184
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,759
martin hellman and winn diffie

185
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,199
and you see that they look a little like

186
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,280
hippies working at nasa they weren't

187
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,319
exactly but

188
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,120
that's the kind of people that tended to

189
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,160
come into

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,400
the cypherpunks movement at the

191
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,080
beginning

192
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
and as we go to the next slide you'll

193
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,080
see one of the things that they built

194
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,319
this is bittorrent and i call it

195
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,120
egalitarian protocols that is there's no

196
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,919
node

197
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,880
that has any advantage over any other

198
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,440
node

199
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,400
this is the kind of assumption that was

200
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,280
built into code by these people

201
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,840
now egalitarian code is not the be-all

202
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,199
and end-all it doesn't work for

203
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,000
everything

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
but this is the kind of idea that they

205
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,039
had

206
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,639
that they wanted to to put into reality

207
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,840
next slide we see a merkle tree

208
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,919
merkle 3 has no advantage notes it's

209
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,440
just math

210
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,919
and this is the type of thing that

211
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,720
again is egalitarian there is no one

212
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,199
that has an advantage the next slide

213
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,560
uh is a charmian mix this is a

214
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,240
an encrypted mix which again

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
no advantage nodes this is the thing

216
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,240
that we use or one of the primary things

217
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,440
we do

218
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
uh to create anonymity now we'll go to

219
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,879
the next slide

220
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,080
this is why i say that bitcoin has

221
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,919
subversion inside bitcoin

222
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,879
has these sorts of assumptions built

223
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,160
into it again

224
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
bittorrent merkle trees they're part of

225
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,280
bitcoin

226
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,919
so bitcoin has these things built in and

227
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,479
it's not

228
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,680
really an attack on the existing system

229
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,240
it's just a different thing and it just

230
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,160
so happens that the existing

231
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
systems the hierarchical systems of the

232
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,759
world

233
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,679
can't really survive competition so

234
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
bitcoin does have subversion inside and

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,120
it is money

236
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,760
and money has tremendous importance

237
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
tremendous pop

238
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,958
only say change the money change the

239
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,440
world and there's a good deal at least

240
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,519
of truth to that it's it's not

241
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,959
complete but there's a good deal of

242
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,800
truth to it and i want you just to back

243
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,480
up next slide

244
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,160
and i want to back up and just make a

245
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
few points on that

246
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,760
and what you're seeing here is a

247
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,720
relic from the ancient sumerians uh this

248
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,000
is called a receipt

249
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
or a or an envelope uh this large

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
ball it's a hollow ball and it has

251
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,920
writings on the surface

252
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,480
and it's for a collection of debts and

253
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,160
these little stones that you see at the

254
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,279
bottom

255
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,839
those are the individual debts that are

256
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,120
in this envelope

257
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,760
as a turkey system that we kind of

258
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,399
thought

259
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,080
the way money we thought came into

260
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,640
existence was we used gold and silver

261
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,800
and then

262
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
as it turns out that really wasn't too

263
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,080
much the case

264
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,480
uh what really happened was that debt

265
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
empowered rulership

266
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,240
let's look to the next slide i'll try to

267
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,519
keep going quickly here

268
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
this is alexander hamilton writing in

269
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
the early american days

270
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
uh saying that is a well-known fact that

271
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,240
where debt is an object of confidence it

272
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,399
answers the purposes of money

273
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,800
transfers of public that are equivalent

274
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
to payment in coins

275
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
so when you have debt everywhere as you

276
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,839
did in the old days

277
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,680
you need a central certification

278
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,360
of debts especially when they're

279
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,959
involved with taxation which

280
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,480
of course they were this greatly

281
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,200
empowered

282
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
rulership silver by itself doesn't need

283
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
a central certification and silver was

284
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,399
always

285
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,360
the money in the old days millions of

286
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,839
debts do need a certifier and this was

287
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,959
tremendously empowering to the i won't

288
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,760
go through details but it was

289
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,519
now next slide

290
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,560
crypto currencies are created without

291
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,920
concurrent debt when you make a dollar

292
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,839
you're also creating debt i won't go

293
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,480
through the

294
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,200
particulars but you're creating t-bills

295
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,839
which have

296
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,120
debt attached and

297
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,200
you also have control because the

298
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,760
government controls the banks if the

299
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,519
banks don't play by their rules

300
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,760
they get shut down so their

301
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,399
cryptocurrency became subversive by

302
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
nature because it doesn't have any debt

303
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,320
attached

304
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,839
you want to loan somebody some

305
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,519
cryptocurrency sure you can

306
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,279
but there's nothing inherent in it that

307
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,120
requires debt

308
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,279
and there is no mechanism of control

309
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,480
built in

310
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
this is subversive to a system that

311
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,760
can't really

312
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,160
bear competition next slide

313
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,760
open bizarre uh you show they have this

314
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,360
nice web of interactions between people

315
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,399
uh next slide particle the same sort of

316
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:40,959
thing

317
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,360
and by the way please support these

318
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,240
people

319
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,279
open bizarre and particle they need you

320
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:47,680
we

321
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,519
need them and things like that

322
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
the free district

323
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,720
we need these next slide i want to back

324
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
up and give you some idea

325
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,160
of how this thing became the dark

326
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,560
totality that's coming upon us

327
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,200
i love these old illustrations they're a

328
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
little bit flamboyant and sometimes not

329
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
entirely fair but they make the point

330
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,760
really well and this one does that

331
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,519
humanity has been harnessed

332
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,800
it is the rule over the of the few over

333
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,680
the many

334
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,040
and it has been for six thousand years

335
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,920
it's the same model from the bronze age

336
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,079
you've got one or two or ten or a few

337
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,120
hundred

338
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
people who make the rules and every told

339
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,120
that they will obey or they will be hurt

340
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
and this is the model and they take your

341
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,320
money and sometimes they send your

342
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,079
children off to die and worse

343
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,160
this is the model and it is a real

344
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,720
real inherent problem let's go to the

345
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,600
next slide

346
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,800
and i want to show you how this

347
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,720
developed because it pertains exactly to

348
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,320
where we are now

349
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,079
at first there was open rulership and

350
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,480
there's so much to explain here that i i

351
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
won't go through the details

352
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
um from 2000 to 4000

353
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,120
4000 to 2000 bc more or less

354
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,680
we had religious empires the sumerians

355
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,720
the egyptians

356
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,240
and others and essentially it was a

357
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,800
religious model built upon sacrifice to

358
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
the gods

359
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,680
which of course meant sacrifice to the

360
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,040
local

361
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,600
the you know the ruler or very closely

362
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,519
associated with the ruler

363
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,680
that failed in the early 2000s bc

364
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,480
and then we got these horrible terror

365
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
based empires you read these old

366
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,519
ancient you know inscriptions of i had

367
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,079
14

368
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,000
nobles against me and then i nailed

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,399
their head to walls and took out their

370
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,040
eyes and

371
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,199
all these terrible things this is the

372
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,800
era where this really

373
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,279
thrived and it worked that way because

374
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,959
these guys got to create

375
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,360
a legend a terror that everyone was

376
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,600
afraid to disobey them

377
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,199
and for a while it worked and then at

378
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,040
1200 bc it collapsed

379
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,320
in flamboyant fashion and then we had a

380
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
period of anarchy

381
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,240
where power devolved until there was

382
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,600
essentially none at all it's

383
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,040
usually called the dark age of the

384
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,680
greeks but this was a time

385
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,760
when other things had a chance to thrive

386
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,880
the phoenicians

387
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,040
the phoenicians have been almost written

388
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
out of world history

389
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,519
but they were crucial for for so many

390
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,480
things you trace

391
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,560
all sorts of things back to their

392
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,320
beginning and you find phoenicians

393
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,079
waiting for you

394
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,920
so they were crucially important and of

395
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
course the hebrews

396
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,839
who this is the time when they had a

397
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,480
chance

398
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,160
to thrive when they were out from

399
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,480
underneath power and they got a chance

400
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,760
to thrive

401
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
so and they're critically important in

402
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,279
other ways but i won't go through that

403
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,320
again

404
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,839
then we had these kingless realms

405
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,880
of greece and rome very carefully

406
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,839
did not have a king the romans when they

407
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,600
started they had a law

408
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,199
and they had laws and if you had a

409
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,720
problem you had to go to the forum

410
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,480
but not if somebody wanted to make

411
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,240
himself king you can kill him right now

412
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,399
no trial no nothing anyone wants to be

413
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,120
king just kill him and then

414
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,839
be in most places of europe during the

415
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,480
quote-unquote

416
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,399
the people eliminated slavery

417
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,440
they're the first people who live on a

418
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
civilizational scale

419
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,199
and period that's not really a fair

420
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,959
explanation but it took that sort of

421
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,920
period for them to do it

422
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,639
all right uh then we went into feudalism

423
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,040
which

424
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,320
isn't wasn't near taught

425
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
and then strong monarchies and then

426
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,079
something happened

427
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,279
we had in the late 1700s we had the

428
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,120
american revolution but that was

429
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
far away on a different continent then

430
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,279
we had the french revolution that kind

431
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:49,759
of went

432
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,959
sideways really fast

433
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,839
neck let's go to the next slide please

434
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,720
and then

435
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
there were a bunch of revolutions in

436
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,880
europe uh 1820 1830 and especially 1848

437
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,600
when the aristocracy was pretty much

438
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,720
kicked out

439
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,120
and that's not entirely true there's all

440
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,639
sorts of complications but

441
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,680
aristocracy was kind of moved out of the

442
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,720
way

443
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,320
and very interestingly this is also the

444
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,120
time

445
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,000
when colonialism began where all of

446
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,880
these nice

447
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,440
elite boys began running things in other

448
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,360
countries overseas

449
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,680
was also the time where silver was

450
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,040
demonetized

451
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
silver was always the money of the

452
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,680
people silver was the basis of the u.s

453
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,560
dollar a dollar was defined as so many

454
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,000
grains of silver

455
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,040
but these through the 1870s it was

456
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,079
removed

457
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,880
by force of law so it's very interesting

458
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,800
how these things developed

459
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,959
and it was also the time of public

460
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,839
credit

461
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,399
and the time of democracy coming in

462
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,320
which

463
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,959
immensely empowered covert rulership

464
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,480
when you have public credit who's

465
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,160
responsible for the debt

466
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,400
it used to be the king and if the king

467
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,039
didn't pay the bank might go bankrupt

468
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,640
well once we had public credit

469
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,000
all of the suckers down on the farms are

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
re responsible for the loans every

471
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,359
citizen

472
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,119
is responsible for the loan and their

473
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,000
children and grandchildren and so on

474
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
wow what can you do with that how could

475
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,359
that be abused

476
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,160
the 100 or so big bosses who sit in the

477
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,679
marble house get to make

478
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,280
debts to the end of time and somebody

479
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,520
else has to pay them the poor schnooks

480
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,440
who work on the farms or in the in the

481
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,120
cities later on

482
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,160
and then you had democracy which meant

483
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,000
there was no one to blame

484
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,840
before there was a prince or a king or

485
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
somebody to blame

486
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,880
now who rules everybody

487
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,200
which means nobody and there's no one to

488
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,919
blame

489
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,240
this was an ideal set up for covert

490
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,120
rulership

491
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,799
and this is why we're getting into a

492
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,400
dark totality

493
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,240
we've moved from democratic power to

494
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,280
networked power i like to

495
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,320
use the example of the

496
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,600
credit report for network power for most

497
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
young people in the modern west their

498
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,320
credit report their ability to get loans

499
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,640
is

500
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,919
crucial but who's responsible for that

501
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,840
um we don't know banks a little bit

502
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,200
credit agency

503
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,679
agencies a little bit really what it is

504
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,640
is interlocked boards of directors

505
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
and of course cooperating with

506
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,559
politicians in the whole

507
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,520
complex but it's networked power and

508
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
you'll see this is the big

509
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
legislative things of the age

510
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,160
we have the trans-pacific partnership

511
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,840
and obamacare and everything else these

512
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,600
are creating networks so this is what

513
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,000
we're getting now

514
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,200
and um

515
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,160
this is what is leading into with

516
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
surveillance capitalism which i cannot

517
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,400
condemn strongly enough

518
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,440
is leading into

519
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,200
this ai or big data driven

520
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,080
personalized manipulation and it's a

521
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,960
very

522
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,760
very dangerous thing but there is a

523
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,440
little bit of good news go to the next

524
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
slide please

525
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,880
and you'll see that this dark totality

526
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,760
as i look at it

527
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,320
can be broken it can be broken fairly

528
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,120
easily

529
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,000
if people stop taking loans from banks

530
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,960
in other words there's

531
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,520
they're not creating any more debt and

532
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,360
they're undercutting the entire debt

533
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,320
system it weakens the system if people

534
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,160
start using cryptocurrencies

535
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
privately whether it be privacy coins or

536
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,679
using bitcoin

537
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,360
better the system no longer controls

538
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,600
money the same would be true for gold

539
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,280
and silver if people actually used it in

540
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
commerce

541
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,559
if they begin homeschooling their

542
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,280
children on any scale the system

543
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,120
is depleted of pre-believing workers

544
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,520
if people use anonymous communication

545
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,559
and notice that i said

546
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,799
anonymous not just encrypted but

547
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,080
anonymous

548
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,039
if you use anonymous communication the

549
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,440
entire manipulation complex

550
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,760
runs out of data and cannot operate

551
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,799
so if we use cryptocurrency

552
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,799
if we use anonymity the system has no

553
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,000
choice but has to

554
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,799
convince people that it's the best

555
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,039
choice for them using reason

556
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,840
instead of fear instead of emotional

557
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,600
manipulation

558
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,360
so the the dark totality can be broken

559
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
and we can break it if enough of us

560
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
decide to do it

561
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,559
all right next slide now here's where it

562
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,000
gets interesting

563
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,799
this is why i say this is insanely great

564
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,960
not just great but insanely great

565
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,360
is that the cypherpunk totality

566
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,400
equals accelerated human evolution now i

567
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,280
know

568
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,120
that sounds like an overly flamboyant

569
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,799
phrase i get it i understand that

570
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,720
stay with me i think you're going to see

571
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,000
something tremendous here

572
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,640
next slide the fundamental fact of human

573
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,760
behavior

574
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,520
is that humans behave almost exactly

575
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,240
like mites who have a prefrontal cortex

576
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,919
that other animal

577
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
people describe it if you look up

578
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,640
descriptions for it

579
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
on wikipedia wherever they'll say the

580
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,679
prefrontal cortex

581
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,480
with executive decisions and that's not

582
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,120
incorrect

583
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,960
but the precon frontal cortex

584
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,799
opened up our internal universe

585
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,840
in other words once we have

586
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,200
self-reference

587
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,240
we have directed imagination

588
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,720
we have a mechanism of morality that i

589
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,159
won't talk about today

590
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,200
it's crucially important the prefrontal

591
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,240
cortex

592
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,320
made us a new type of being

593
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,520
true type of consciousness this is

594
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,760
this is stunning but it's absolutely

595
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
true i want you to see how it happened

596
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,159
look at the next slide please

597
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,559
if you if you look up from the bottom

598
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,880
the the third one up

599
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,640
is homo habilis a primate

600
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
um of two million years ago or a lot

601
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,000
more than that

602
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,039
actually look at that skull

603
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,440
the third one up it has an eyebrow ridge

604
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,559
and the skull

605
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,640
goes directly back from there there is

606
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,320
no forehead

607
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,480
none it just goes directly back from the

608
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,640
eyebrows now look at the top one which

609
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,520
is us

610
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,679
look at that forehead from the eyebrows

611
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,120
it goes straight up

612
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,400
and makes a cavern of sorts in there

613
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,039
that

614
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,600
the other ones didn't have that is

615
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,799
precisely

616
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,120
where this prefrontal cortex goes

617
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,760
that's we are a different type of

618
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,799
creature

619
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,720
a fundamentally different in in

620
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
consciousness now i want you to look

621
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,520
that graph

622
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
just to throw another point in here

623
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,360
that's very interesting

624
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,159
and that graph shows the size of primate

625
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,760
brains and you see you know from seven

626
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,080
and then all of a sudden at two million

627
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,200
years ago it turns into the proverbial

628
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,960
and all of a sudden everything goes wild

629
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,919
there are theories that come and go but

630
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,120
none of them really have

631
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,880
have legs none of them really stand up

632
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,480
we just don't know

633
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,840
why that happened but we and that is

634
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,400
humans got a prefrontal cortex that

635
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,720
opened up our interior

636
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,240
universe let's go to the next slide

637
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,480
now i wanna i wanna make this clear this

638
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,880
is we're really getting into

639
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,240
interesting stuff the core model of

640
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,640
prime had no foreheads

641
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,960
their the core model of their culture

642
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,400
how they interacted

643
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,279
was the dominance hierarchy you have the

644
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,039
big apes slapping around the smaller

645
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,960
apes slapping around the female apes

646
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,640
slapping around with the children

647
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,760
and so on it was obviously more

648
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,520
complicated than that

649
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,520
but you get the basic idea this is also

650
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,320
the model

651
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,360
of human rulership

652
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,799
it's the same dominance hierarchy yes in

653
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,240
human

654
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,000
more complicated because we're different

655
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
sort of beings

656
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,960
and there's a whole lot to say about

657
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
this i just started going over this in

658
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,559
my

659
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,640
talking about it more i'm sure it'll end

660
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,240
up as a book someday

661
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,919
but here so this these are the model of

662
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,960
both i've got a quote here from a

663
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,000
a primatologist from a a

664
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,640
well-known

665
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,640
who are we still connected

666
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,559
apparently you guys can still see me um

667
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,120
i'm on chat let me know otherwise uh

668
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,480
you're actually quite good

669
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,760
uh so please continue a great

670
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,320
presentation

671
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,360
all right nancy

672
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,520
all right i'm going to keep going so

673
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,200
this

674
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,799
well-known non-human primates

675
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,240
favored access to resources arises

676
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,000
larger shares by force or threat of

677
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,440
we don't believe anymore we've got the

678
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
big foreheads we've got the prefrontal

679
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,559
cortex we have the in

680
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,000
it's like i say reputation cooperation

681
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,640
all of our advanced abilities

682
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,840
it is the seat of post-primate

683
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,400
functions and that phrase to me is

684
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,840
terribly important we are

685
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,640
post-primate that's what we are we're

686
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,559
not the same as primates yeah we share a

687
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,400
whole lot of

688
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,279
with them and it's all was very

689
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,000
complicated and so on

690
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,400
we are suited to something better next

691
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,000
slide

692
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,240
our evolution is special and i want to

693
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,440
make this one last

694
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,600
last point before i start wrapping it up

695
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,159
i'm not going to read all of these

696
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,640
quotes it's faster

697
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,200
than everybody else you

698
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,559
is tied in with human culture no one

699
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,000
knows why

700
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,480
um but human culture is crucially

701
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,520
solution let's take two examples

702
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,000
in ten eight thousand

703
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,159
earth with very very few exceptions

704
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,720
could digest cow's milk

705
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,760
now in northern europe the

706
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,120
vast majority 80 or more can

707
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,679
and people of north european extraction

708
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,880
all over the world

709
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,880
can so they change and it's reflected in

710
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,679
the dna

711
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,600
you can find in the dna which we're very

712
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,360
good at at decoding

713
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,919
you can find where there is this new

714
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,760
section of dna

715
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,720
that allows to build proteins that lead

716
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,200
to the

717
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,320
digestion of cow's milk but it's even

718
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
better than that

719
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,039
this sometimes is done over centuries

720
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,480
mere centuries

721
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,679
the jews of europe because of the very

722
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,679
particular circumstances that they were

723
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,480
in for a number of centuries

724
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,039
adapted and you can see it in the dna

725
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,080
they got a 10

726
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,240
boost in their iq because that's what it

727
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,640
took for them to survive

728
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,480
and they got it and you can see it in

729
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,559
the dna that came

730
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,360
with with a price sometimes the the

731
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
spatial acuity is not quite the same

732
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
and there are more genetic diseases of

733
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,600
particular types but this happened in

734
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,080
mere

735
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,279
centuries so human culture

736
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,480
is now affecting our evolution making it

737
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,440
insanely

738
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,480
important now

739
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,880
one more this is where two paths diverge

740
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,279
for us

741
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,080
we have their high foreheads for a

742
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
reason we have a different

743
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,600
method of operating we are no longer

744
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,640
designed

745
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,200
to live according to a system of

746
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,320
primates

747
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,720
we're not we're no longer designed for a

748
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,080
dominance hierarchy

749
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,320
in our private lives in any healthy

750
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,880
family we don't operate that way

751
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,279
in any local community organization here

752
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,960
in the states it's the little league or

753
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,039
in your area football leagues

754
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,840
we don't operate that way um

755
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
we operate by a different level and this

756
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
is the way that the cypherpunks in the

757
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,679
beginning operated

758
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,679
it was ad hoc coordination it was

759
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,159
massive cooperation it was a disbelief

760
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:04,720
in in

761
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,440
central power it was a belief in the

762
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,760
efficacy of the human individual

763
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,880
and systems that allow that human to

764
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,000
be effective rather to than to be a

765
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,720
one member of a dominance hierarchy that

766
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,080
are given orders and told

767
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,360
obey or else we're a different thing

768
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,720
and so we have the old model which is

769
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,480
the dominance hierarchy

770
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,919
which is never going to change it's

771
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,360
never going to get that much better as

772
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,720
long as there's power

773
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,200
it's always going to be corruptable it's

774
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,120
always going to be the old

775
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,200
dominance model and it's always going to

776
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,640
go bad question is only how fast

777
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,960
our new totality partial incomplete

778
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,320
new as it may be

779
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,360
allows us to develop a new way it

780
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,039
allows us to use self-reference as a

781
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,080
primary tool

782
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,120
to use the golden rule as a primary tool

783
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,559
to be hyper cooperative it allows us to

784
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,039
do

785
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,600
all of the higher realm things all of

786
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,159
the new

787
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,080
species sort of things and it even

788
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,000
this is this is one of the incredible

789
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080
things about bitcoin

790
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,440
is that one of the human

791
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,520
limitations is something called dunbar's

792
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,000
number and it just means that humans

793
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,440
have a hard time

794
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,960
keeping 150 or 200 or more than that

795
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
many people in their minds at the same

796
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,159
time and considering them

797
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,720
as individuals it just seems to be a

798
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,480
limitation of

799
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,159
brain capacity of mental capacity

800
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,679
bitcoin transcends that bitcoin and all

801
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,120
the currencies that are

802
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,720
built on the bitcoin model are methods

803
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,200
of scaling trust

804
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,120
bitcoin blows through dunbar's

805
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,360
we have and it blows through we can

806
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,760
trust millions of people now

807
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,519
and in a decentralized way

808
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,159
oh my god this is a big deal and it

809
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,519
empowers

810
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,320
this cypherpunk totality so

811
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,919
by living this new way we are becoming

812
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,840
better not only individually

813
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,960
but genetically this

814
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,600
was why i say this is insanely great and

815
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,640
here we are

816
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,559
we're part of it we've got the first

817
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,720
pieces in place we're using them every

818
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,000
day we're building them we're

819
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,120
expanding them every day this is

820
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,480
so much bigger than we thought it was

821
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,600
to my mind these are things we must

822
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,200
do we need it the world at large needs

823
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,039
it

824
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,519
and i'm convinced and i hope that all of

825
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,519
you feel likewise

826
00:31:51,519 --> 00:32:00,159
thank you very much

827
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,519
uh thank you very much paul that there

828
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,600
was quite an interesting one with this

829
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,919
um i would like to start off with one

830
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:06,720
question before i

831
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,320
ask the audience and and that is that

832
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,399
you've showed that this recent progress

833
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,600
has been exponential

834
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,760
uh and it seems that even even more so

835
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,960
in in these times

836
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,799
it just kind of picks up on speed more

837
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,880
and more and more uh so so the question

838
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,440
is

839
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,480
um like how sustainable is is that level

840
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,640
of growth or do you proceed it to

841
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
further continue expanding at never

842
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,679
exponentially growing rate the answer is

843
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,360
that we don't know

844
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,080
um the the jews of europe ex

845
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,480
increased genetically physically

846
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,440
biologically

847
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,399
very quickly but there were trade-offs

848
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,440
probably much worth it but there were

849
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,360
trade-offs so we really don't know how

850
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,640
fast we can go

851
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,960
and we don't really know how far we can

852
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,559
go

853
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,320
we're in new territory we're in a new

854
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
realm we know that we are picking up

855
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,360
no question no question our speed of

856
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,320
improvement has

857
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,440
has increased greatly and

858
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,480
that we are becoming better

859
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,399
uh how far and how fast we can go

860
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,640
your guess is as good as mine we just

861
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:25,840
don't know

862
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,840
hello paul do you hear me

863
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,039
yeah i hear me uh like the way i think

864
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:39,679
about it

865
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,559
like we have exponential development of

866
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,039
all these

867
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,080
different technologies like genetics and

868
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,200
robotics and

869
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,440
ai and all these things that can

870
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,600
potentially uh destroy us

871
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,399
uh or like cause humanity to

872
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,080
self-destruct

873
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,600
uh much easier um and the way i think

874
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,880
about bitcoin is like that's the

875
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,679
basically the only hope for humanity

876
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,280
that we get the sound

877
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
monetary system so we get the right

878
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
incentive system in place

879
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,918
to do good instead of doing bad

880
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,199
basically

881
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,199
so do you have a comment on that

882
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,639
uh yeah part of your question uh blanked

883
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,000
out on me unfortunately but i think i

884
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,280
got the g

885
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,719
uh yeah this is a tremendous hope for

886
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,639
humanity i wouldn't say it's the only

887
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,159
one because there's always something

888
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,520
else and there's always things that we

889
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,918
don't expect that come along

890
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,399
um humans find a way uh life finds a way

891
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,239
um but gosh bitcoin

892
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,599
and and having

893
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,000
a different model of money which means a

894
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,440
different model of cooperation

895
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,160
insanely important you know humans

896
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,880
survive

897
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,440
by cooperating with one another that's

898
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,280
how we survive

899
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,040
and to do that better

900
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,920
where it leads but this is exactly what

901
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,200
we've come into

902
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,079
we have a better model of doing it and i

903
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,440
think we need to run with it and make

904
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,480
the most

905
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,160
um the pirate party um made an attempt

906
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,040
in

907
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,320
europe and especially germany uh to

908
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,880
um popularize liquid democracy um

909
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,280
i i think that you have written a bit

910
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,560
about it um

911
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,599
um do you still think that um there

912
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,320
there is a

913
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,359
bright future for a liquid democracy um

914
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,920
or do you no longer believe that the

915
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,839
political system can

916
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,760
be be changed the current political

917
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,079
system

918
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,079
well the current political system

919
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,680
change you know everybody else

920
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,839
with them they they come on the stage

921
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,240
they pray

922
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,000
is um

923
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,240
a flawedly however

924
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,560
if i could go back to let's say the way

925
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,920
uh were in the united states which i

926
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,200
know very well underneath

927
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,280
the articles of confederation or even

928
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,599
underneath the u.s constitution in the

929
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,640
very early days

930
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,079
my god i'd go back in a second

931
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,359
because it's so much less bad than what

932
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,359
we have now

933
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,480
but democracy by itself is in

934
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,920
an imperfect model it may however

935
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,079
and i say this i mean it precisely this

936
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,119
way it may be

937
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,480
considerably less bad than what we have

938
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,040
now

939
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,280
it's never going to be the ultimate and

940
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,640
future model

941
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,240
but if we could get you know a

942
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,160
1787 american system

943
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
yeah i'd sign on to be make things a

944
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,680
hell of a lot better for a number of

945
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,000
years

946
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,920
any thoughts on liquid democracy

947
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,599
i think you're you're familiar familiar

948
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,920
with it

949
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,240
you know i i don't know i'm sorry

950
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,200
i i don't know i don't know the system

951
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,480
very well at all

952
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,920
and i i really can't comment apologies

953
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,200
hey um i have a question

954
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,359
around um people caring about crypto so

955
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,040
in the crypto and the bitcoin community

956
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,960
most people have already

957
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,200
bought what we're selling here in a way

958
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,119
and most of the world doesn't

959
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,320
have that viewpoint and if you ask them

960
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,520
you know how they feel about their

961
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,119
government they wouldn't like it but it

962
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,040
wouldn't be enough of a reason to

963
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,520
uh you know start using bitcoin or start

964
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,280
uh

965
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,240
building a new system so the question is

966
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,280
what would it

967
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,560
in your opinion what would it take um

968
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,920
what needs to happen uh that would

969
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,839
cause the majority of people to actually

970
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,079
care about these things and say okay

971
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,599
i'm not gonna use this fiat or i'm not

972
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,680
gonna okay you know cooperate with the

973
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,839
government

974
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,000
okay what is required really is time

975
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,960
um things change more slowly than we'd

976
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,480
like

977
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,440
and what we need to do is just to do our

978
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:35,839
thing

979
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,599
and to show people what we're doing to

980
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,280
show them that it's here

981
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,599
that it's not crazy people who do it

982
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,640
that there is

983
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,800
a humane and benevolent outside

984
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,040
and they can dip their toe into it they

985
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,240
can take a look

986
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,160
they can go and come back and take

987
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,000
another look and come back

988
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,040
and slowly decide that

989
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,680
maybe that outside isn't so bad after

990
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,240
all

991
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,479
and then when things go

992
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,200
in their life or in or in the larger

993
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,000
community

994
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,880
here and the system is

995
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,760
ruining my business but i can go over

996
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,920
there and i can do business over there i

997
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,680
know my friend bobby

998
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,400
how to do it i'm going to try that and

999
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,960
those are the kinds of changes

1000
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,760
that will really alter our realm and

1001
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,960
it's going to be slow

1002
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,720
we just have to keep doing what we're

1003
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,640
doing show your neighbors

1004
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
talk to people yes they're going to call

1005
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,079
you goofy

1006
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,480
for the first two or three times they

1007
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,359
run into it

1008
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,040
because they're defending their past

1009
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,160
actions they're defending their inertia

1010
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,079
they're you know defending their their

1011
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,920
mental comfort zone

1012
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,119
just keep at it just keep going talk to

1013
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,920
about it be benevolent

1014
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,839
and it will come will come around it

1015
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,440
will i know

1016
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,560
we none of us want it to take long but

1017
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,480
maybe to build upon that last question a

1018
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,240
bit more specifically you you have

1019
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,160
articulated in your writings that

1020
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,839
uh free marketplace right and an

1021
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,920
anonymous marketplace in multiple

1022
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,079
scenarios and i think that well you've

1023
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,920
outlined the concepts of it quite well

1024
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,599
and we even have some implementation and

1025
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,520
some working code or something like open

1026
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,240
bazaar

1027
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,160
um though it still seems that the system

1028
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,839
is struggling and not really reaching a

1029
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:26,800
lot of adoption

1030
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,680
um other than aspect of time do you have

1031
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,040
any specific

1032
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,240
um ideas why this is that this the usage

1033
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,160
of this technology is still lacking

1034
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,000
are there any meaningful steps on from

1035
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,560
our side missing

1036
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,640
well first of all again talk to your

1037
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,000
neighbors and friends

1038
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,839
you know tell them oh hey i bought this

1039
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,440
thing on open bazaar look it's really

1040
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,160
cool

1041
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,520
um those sorts of things are are always

1042
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,640
what we do

1043
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,880
but there are other pieces we can build

1044
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,400
um if we want a real

1045
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,800
functioning full full private economy

1046
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
we need things like anonymous drone

1047
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,960
delivery

1048
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,599
and i've written a little bit about that

1049
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,319
uh

1050
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,599
to sketch the system out in some in it

1051
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,839
so i'd call it's a series called rise of

1052
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,440
the superfluous class

1053
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,760
uh we need to do better with uh

1054
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,839
exchanging

1055
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,880
that will help a lot

1056
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,319
but and we just need to use our systems

1057
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,359
and to use them

1058
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,240
more and to just again friends and

1059
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,280
neighbors

1060
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,680
we're really good at building stuff we

1061
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,640
need to better

1062
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,839
sharing yes really interesting

1063
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,440
paul one final question before i let you

1064
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,119
go um because

1065
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,960
during your talk i kind of got one

1066
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,319
additional insight in

1067
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,680
why you potentially have named your

1068
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,160
company crypto hippie uh so so i did not

1069
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,920
know about that that uh specific tight

1070
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,520
relationship between the hippies and the

1071
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,400
cypherpunks

1072
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,839
could you please elaborate a bit more on

1073
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,040
that and actually give some more

1074
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,800
concrete reasons on for that specific

1075
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,960
name

1076
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,480
sure uh jonathan and i

1077
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,440
when um when we started it uh it was

1078
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,200
really important

1079
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,560
to him as much as me um maybe more

1080
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,078
uh that

1081
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,560
just for commercial reason that we have

1082
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,000
um other

1083
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,520
to get you know crypto hippie really is

1084
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,960
is about

1085
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,000
keeping a door open out of the matrix

1086
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,920
to people who want it and very well

1087
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,920
um and we wanted to have the idea

1088
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,680
of something more than just commerce

1089
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,160
nothing wrong with just commerce but we

1090
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,000
wanted to have that we have

1091
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
other ideas built in this this is a

1092
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,599
business to us but it's not just a

1093
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,440
business it's a mission

1094
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,960
it seemed to be a pretty good

1095
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,640
um a pretty good model for us and uh

1096
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,800
uh once upon a time i was a bit of a

1097
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,079
hypocrite you still have pictures of the

1098
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,880
long hair

1099
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,599
and big beard

1100
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,560
i don't have any something may exist

1101
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,160
somewhere i don't think i've burned them

1102
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,400
all

1103
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,079
well let's see how good their object is

1104
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,130
let them begin

1105
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,119
[Laughter]

1106
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,599
paul this was a phenomenal presentation

1107
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:26,890
thank you very much for hanging out

1108
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:30,720
[Laughter]

1109
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,920
so again thank you very much for all the

1110
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,359
work that you do all the writings and of

1111
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,800
course being influential and paranoid

1112
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,359
police

1113
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,040
i believe without you there would not be

1114
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,720
a hacker's congress and for sure not the

1115
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,520
seventh of it

1116
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,000
uh so this was a phenomenal event uh i

1117
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,920
believe this is the final presentation

1118
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,960
on the stage

1119
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,520
um meaning that this really is the last

1120
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,880
of the hackers congress at least we're

1121
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,359
here

1122
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,280
right now there's already a uh the the

1123
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,400
closing speech on the main stage

1124
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,800
and we will move over there and finish

1125
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,839
it up strong

1126
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,839
but again thanks very much paul despite

1127
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,200
the troubles that the bureaucrats make

1128
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,839
you

1129
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,720
you still attended hcpp in cyberspace

1130
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,560
which is almost as good as a meat space

1131
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,760
but looking forward to see you again

1132
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:21,680
next time in person
