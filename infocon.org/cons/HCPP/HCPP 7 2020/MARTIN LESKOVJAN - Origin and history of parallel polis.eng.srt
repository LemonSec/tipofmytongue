1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,359
so

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,880
today uh when you opened the news in the

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,000
morning

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,920
you could see the big titles how the

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,520
elections that happened

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,640
yesterday and the day before

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,279
uh finally uh happened what were the

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,640
results

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,000
so again in czech republic we

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,599
went through this ritual of uh regular

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,680
elections so people went to vote

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
and uh when we will talk about

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,079
police i think it's interesting to stop

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,120
at this point because czech meaning of

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,920
the term to vote means halasovat

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,160
or dadlas to give a vote

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,800
has very interesting etymology because

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
when you strictly translate the term

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,600
alas it's not a vote it's a voice

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,799
so when you when you vote in check it

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,960
means you give a voice

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,360
when you give a voice you give up your

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,479
own voice

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,400
you hand it over to someone else and he

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,240
got the voice and he can tell you shut

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,159
up i have the voice no

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,680
so what we are going to talk about is

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,720
different way a

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,960
different attitude you can take other

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,000
than

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
giving up your voice not to

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,320
give up your voice not to vote for

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,720
usually we say smaller evil but

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,960
there is possibly another another way

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,159
but we are here to talk about the

37
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,159
concept parapolis and

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,439
where it comes from and uh

39
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,399
i have to say a little story behind most

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,159
of you probably heard about it

41
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
but for those who didn't this space

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,159
was originally inspired by a slovak

43
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,240
hackerspace progress bar

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,318
and progress bar uh was a little bit

45
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,160
different hackerspace than others

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,760
because it was not primarily um

47
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,480
geek club where you just bustled and

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,599
worked with

49
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,200
with technologies and so on but they

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,879
were very much focused on

51
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,400
um lectures and education

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,520
and gatherings which we liked a lot

53
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,640
that they didn't only close up to to

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,160
small community but they also promoted

55
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,720
they also promoted uh some new

56
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,400
technologies crypto technologies and so

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,200
on

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,959
so we wanted to have something similar

59
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
in pla in prague

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
and we were searching for a format a

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,720
space some venue for it

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,560
and of course a name and when we have

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
found this house

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,840
we realize that we can be something

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,920
more something wider than just the

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
hackerspace

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
it can create a space that will serve to

68
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
public to

69
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,959
to get simply knowledge ideas

70
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,319
inspiration whatever

71
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,680
whatever else and then i uh one evening

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,080
when we were setting up this this

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,239
premise and we were

74
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,319
preparing the first hackers congress six

75
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,000
six years ago

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,040
we uh i talked to

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,760
my friend who studied political sciences

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,680
and i was describing him

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,879
what we aim to do here i just i i told

80
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,680
him about

81
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
bitcoin and liberating technologies and

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
encryption and creating some unique

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,920
special and separate sphere of

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,720
relationships beside uh

85
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,000
beside the state an official one and he

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
told me

87
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,120
the the thing you are calling that are

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
you talking about

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,599
uh bender called federal police

90
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,720
uh it's the same thing you want to do i

91
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,840
said

92
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,080
i've never heard about it but i will

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,480
write it down because it sounds really

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,840
cool so we started to

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,879
we we took this word these two words

96
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,959
and we started to study what's behind

97
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,080
and we realized that

98
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,238
we know all the context but this small

99
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,639
word the particular phase

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,079
parallel police remained just in in

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,520
some texts uh from from the past from

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,880
communist regime from

103
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,320
70s as you will see and

104
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,639
it it remained partially forgotten so

105
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
pearl police

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,280
until 214 wasn't some hyped

107
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,080
war that everybody knows but exactly the

108
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
opposite

109
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
like only a few historians and few

110
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,960
political scientists

111
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,000
knew the word the term pearl police so

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
we realized so we

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,160
decided to take it up and give it

114
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,680
a new life

115
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
as we were diving into into the term

116
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,080
um it was interesting interesting and

117
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,800
important

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,320
to understand uh where where the term

119
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,039
comes from

120
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,120
and especially for those of you who are

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,479
not into

122
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,000
mid-europe history

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,759
it's very important to understand at

124
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,360
least the very basics

125
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,280
how the environment and the era

126
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
where the polish comes from looked like

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,880
and how it developed

128
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,960
so we are we are in deep 70s

129
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,720
when we talk about police and

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
at this time you can see it was uh it

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
was deep communism

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,440
here which started in 1948

133
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,039
with very brutal uh change

134
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,080
uh which was very very unexpected and it

135
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,479
was big lesson because after the second

136
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,360
world war

137
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
everybody thought that this animal

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
stuff and terror and brutals that

139
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
happened during the second world war

140
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,199
will not happen again and huh 48 and 49

141
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,240
and it was here again

142
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,440
in in a very very sharp way

143
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,080
the communists achieved during one or

144
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,280
two years

145
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,960
to to spread the fear and and orders

146
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,530
so effectively that that

147
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,120
[Music]

148
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
they they simply smashed all opposition

149
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,319
or

150
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,720
or other voices and and

151
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,840
established really tough uh totalitarian

152
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,160
regime

153
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
then in 58 you probably know about

154
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,199
khrushchev and his critics of stalinism

155
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,319
and so on so

156
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,120
so the situation stabilized a little bit

157
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,919
and

158
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,319
and the environment became a little

159
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,360
little bit more

160
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
liberal and breathable

161
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,960
then a very important uh part was the

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,319
prague spring

163
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
67 and 68 which was an era

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
of very high level of liberty

165
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,960
and very optimistic social atmosphere

166
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,440
then especially art literature

167
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,039
but also many other professions could

168
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,599
suddenly express themselves much freer

169
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,280
than it was

170
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,560
used before and

171
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,319
to this situation without any warning

172
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,479
in 68 there was this direct

173
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,759
invasion of ussr armies you probably

174
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,800
know

175
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,919
about which which

176
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,680
was like a punch from the soviet union

177
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
that nobody expected

178
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,840
and to this peaceful and liberal

179
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
environment suddenly

180
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,199
came the soviet tanks and started to

181
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,720
uh started to shout to

182
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,879
public buildings like national museum

183
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,160
and so on so

184
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,479
for for the witnesses uh as i was

185
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,080
interviewing

186
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,400
uh during uh during my program uh police

187
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,960
101 uh zero oh

188
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,800
that was exactly about this era

189
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
they told me that they were totally

190
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,080
shocked

191
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,919
by what was happening even though they

192
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,520
already had the experience of the

193
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,719
communist region before

194
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,039
then from the 1968 and 80s

195
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,199
after the occupation there came

196
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,160
so-called

197
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,360
normalization it was very tough wave

198
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,399
of uh totalitarian practices

199
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,159
which we will be going to talk about and

200
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,360
in 80s

201
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,640
there started some stagnation the regime

202
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
started to be more in defense than in

203
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,080
orphans

204
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,160
and the structure started to

205
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,680
simply disintegrate and uh

206
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
and uh um and so on

207
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
so when we talk about parallel policy

208
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,279
and when it

209
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,080
happened so we talk about this era this

210
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
70s

211
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,079
after the ussr army occupation

212
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,480
so we call this era normalization so

213
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,399
what what what happened in 68

214
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,320
the tanks cam the the armies and

215
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,560
after that there were a couple of

216
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,839
individual

217
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,480
uh acts of protest one of the most

218
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,720
famous is a self-burning of jan palach

219
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
and his followers which was very strong

220
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,240
act of protest but

221
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
uh but the regime succeed in spreading

222
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,399
fear and

223
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,160
and simply discouraged

224
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,519
the opposition to uh act somehow

225
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,399
in a unified way and and in some

226
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,839
structured way

227
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,680
so only very few individual activities

228
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,640
of some protest this and and so on

229
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,920
remained

230
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,079
one of them was so-called and one of the

231
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,279
most powerful in

232
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,040
czechoslovakia was so-called second

233
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,160
culture which was represented mostly by

234
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,440
fall underground and other

235
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,440
musicians and then some theaters and so

236
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,399
on you probably know

237
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
story of what's la favel etc so you can

238
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,640
you can see

239
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,760
uh then uh lots of

240
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,440
uh intellectual elites were fired from

241
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,399
universities

242
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
and scientological uh

243
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,640
works workplaces and so on and

244
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,680
they lose their job lost their job and

245
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,800
had to find something else to do usually

246
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,360
it was

247
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,640
some uh workers uh

248
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
like second class kind of the work like

249
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,920
manual work and so on

250
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
and the only way they could continue

251
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,320
their work was to

252
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,680
to go to underground so they started to

253
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,640
create so-called

254
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,079
apartment universities and small groups

255
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,120
where they

256
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
continued with teaching

257
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
and doing publication activities and so

258
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,680
on

259
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,720
well what's also interesting is uh

260
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,320
that very important role played the

261
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,839
christians christians groups and and

262
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,399
churches

263
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,519
which is not frequently mentioned and

264
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,160
then in uh 1977

265
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,360
the the one of the most significant acts

266
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,320
of

267
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,120
of resistance was so-called chart of 77

268
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,839
which was a like um

269
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,920
part or or some result of growing

270
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,040
influence of

271
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
of different small movements and

272
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,240
individuals

273
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,480
who started to be more and more

274
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,680
discomfort but also encouraged

275
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,199
due to the regime practices

276
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,079
so what is interesting and important

277
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,600
also is to see that

278
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,720
uh the the czechoslovak context

279
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,240
is very different from other soviet

280
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,720
uh countries even in the european bloc

281
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,959
so when you when you search for other

282
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,519
dissident movements in other countries

283
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,920
you see a very different strategies that

284
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,399
have been taken

285
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,079
one of the most powerful

286
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,120
this is a movement was uh was

287
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,800
was established in poland uh

288
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,160
where in 80s

289
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,800
lekh walesa and his fellows kind of

290
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,000
hacked

291
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
the system in a very interesting way

292
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,920
because what they did was not any

293
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,760
unofficial movement

294
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,880
but they they found in the

295
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,600
constitution that workers had have a

296
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,000
right

297
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
to create unions unions of workers

298
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,120
and these these unions have a

299
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,959
right to to partial independence

300
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,519
and sovereignty and self-governance so

301
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,480
they claimed

302
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,760
uh they claimed this these rights and as

303
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,240
they were

304
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,600
workers movement which was the basic

305
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,040
vehicle for for for socialism

306
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
they they kind of hacked the system

307
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,320
because

308
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,440
they achieved uh that the government and

309
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,720
the and the kurds

310
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,959
had to admit that they have this right

311
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,800
and they they have this sovereignty and

312
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,279
then

313
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,839
they can continue to work and in

314
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,040
1981 they already had 10 million

315
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,800
10 million subscribers because as it was

316
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,360
workers union they could suddenly spread

317
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,120
around poland

318
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,839
in many different cities and and

319
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,760
whatever whatever kind of organizations

320
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,320
that had

321
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,760
more workers and uh and

322
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,560
that's why they were in a mass way very

323
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,760
very successful and

324
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,959
very influential in hungary

325
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,720
when i take another uh example uh

326
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,680
the the opposition or or the protest

327
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,480
movement were more like

328
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,519
relevant political opposition they they

329
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,279
were more like reformists

330
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,079
who wanted to discuss with the system

331
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:36,800
and

332
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,959
and push to change to change the system

333
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,399
so it was more like political

334
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,760
way of of changing things

335
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,279
another example is uh for slovakia

336
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,320
where where the dissident movements

337
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,040
were very small like in comparison

338
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,639
especially to poland but

339
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,519
even with with uh czech republic but

340
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:01,839
they

341
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,079
they had different nature for example

342
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,279
environmental

343
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,880
uh protecting groups or or churches

344
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,000
or or individuals

345
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,040
um who who operated

346
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,720
in in different spots in slovakia so

347
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
so we have to understand that that

348
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,639
the context of these parallel policies

349
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,600
if we

350
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,519
if you use a very wide term

351
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,560
differed country to country and culture

352
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
to culture let's say

353
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,160
but now we are going to talk about

354
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,000
charter 77 because

355
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,079
there is a direct link between the term

356
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,240
para police and charter 77

357
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,839
that i will uh explain you to you

358
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
so uh what what was charge 77

359
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,839
it was basically a petition

360
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,440
of of so-called civil society

361
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,560
that just wanted uh an

362
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,160
appeal to government to keep the rules

363
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,320
that they

364
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,440
they accepted via international treaties

365
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,399
that

366
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,839
that that contain

367
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,279
norms related to human rights

368
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,079
it was signed in helsinki in 70s

369
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,360
but immediately the regime started to

370
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,160
like interrupt and not to not to keep

371
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,079
the rules

372
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,519
so so charity 77 was an appeal

373
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,279
that wanted to be legal and

374
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,639
direct dialogue with the government

375
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,480
and applied to appeal to

376
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,079
to comply with their human rights

377
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,680
rules here you can see some

378
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,240
some quotes so you see the narrative and

379
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,320
and examples of the text

380
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,760
so it was it was really like

381
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,480
um from from from our perspective it was

382
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,520
nothing nothing very uh

383
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,799
aggressive because they just asked to

384
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,199
keep

385
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,559
the rules the state already accepted

386
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,599
but in this time it was

387
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,240
really very uh very brave act

388
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,440
which which the regime

389
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,360
took really really really bad

390
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,200
uh how how the charter 77

391
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,559
worked so it was a text elaborated by

392
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,280
a collective of authors that wanted to

393
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,000
remain

394
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
uh anonymous but one of

395
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,960
one of them were over was also vastly

396
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,760
bender and others other other important

397
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,320
names

398
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,520
of the czech dissident movement

399
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,240
they they insist on remaining

400
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,520
unpolitical in

401
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,559
in terms that uh charter 77

402
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,360
unified different professions different

403
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,760
uh

404
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,880
political uh

405
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,559
thinking different different currents

406
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,679
of thought and so on so

407
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,640
so they wanted to unify all the streams

408
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,200
of

409
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,520
of uh protests and and opposition

410
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,640
movements

411
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,559
uh together uh

412
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,120
they didn't achieve that much uh mass

413
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,400
influence finally

414
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,600
it had like one one one thousand two

415
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,320
hundred

416
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,760
signers uh until the end of communism

417
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,640
so it remained a very small uh very

418
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,320
small initiative

419
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
but the reaction of the regime shows

420
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,240
that it was

421
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
it was like a hit to the black uh middle

422
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,400
point

423
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,840
because uh because the the regime react

424
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,960
really really um you know in a strong

425
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,320
way

426
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,200
so all the protagonists afterwards were

427
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,679
were

428
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,480
uh quite brutally chased and

429
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,520
interrogated

430
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,720
and and still under uh

431
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,640
still under surveillance criminalized

432
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,919
lots of them uh remained or ended up in

433
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,799
in jail finally um so what was the

434
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,679
reaction uh vaslav bender describes uh

435
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,200
the ways of reaction

436
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,200
uh in in a in a small article

437
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,360
from uh 1968 where he summarized that

438
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,880
a very interesting uh point

439
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,200
and it was that the the regime had set

440
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
of strategies

441
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,600
that they repeatedly uh changed they

442
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,240
they

443
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,640
they still use the same they only

444
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
changed that this time we're gonna

445
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
create some anti-campaign one of

446
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,559
examples is so-called anti-charter

447
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,760
which was a text that was refusing uh

448
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,159
the charter 77

449
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,280
requirements and and appeals

450
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,520
and they they uh asked all the

451
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,480
uh czechoslovak elite uh especially

452
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,240
artists and

453
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,520
and uh teachers from professors and so

454
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,400
on and so on to

455
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,640
to uh to sign it

456
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,400
so so they they've created a very strong

457
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,280
uh media pressure based on uh defamation

458
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,559
you could read that the charter 77s

459
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,480
representants were were like junkies who

460
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,240
who took drugs and poisoned wells

461
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,480
and were funded by by imperialists from

462
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,120
us

463
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,200
and so on and so on so really really

464
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
like

465
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,720
so if we if we talk about fake news

466
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,080
today it was nothing

467
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,919
in comparison to fake news generated by

468
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,960
by the communist regime

469
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,320
at this time another another way was

470
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
bureaucratic prosecution so whatever you

471
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,520
wanted to do

472
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
and you needed some approval for it you

473
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,880
didn't get it

474
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
you couldn't travel you couldn't study

475
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,640
you couldn't whatever

476
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,720
you were still in some clash with

477
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,600
administration

478
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
another another way was police

479
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,120
repression

480
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,159
so everybody from the movement knew that

481
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:32,720
they have

482
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
their own police officer they knew that

483
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,840
the the power tries to persuade other

484
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,400
people

485
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,120
to cooperate with them and became agents

486
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,240
so they knew that

487
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,480
there are probably are infiltrated

488
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,400
agents among them

489
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,039
and they will they were totally without

490
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,159
any reasoning

491
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,520
suddenly arrested interrogated for a

492
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,720
couple of hours and then

493
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,360
they let them go and and they did it

494
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,200
repeatedly all the time so you never

495
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,600
knew

496
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,679
if you come back home or not uh any day

497
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,720
another another way was that they

498
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,919
created criminal trials usually

499
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,559
construct

500
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,679
from constructed uh reasons and

501
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,039
background

502
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,240
and uh then they imprisoned

503
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,679
the the actors uh

504
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,080
based on these these constructed

505
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,240
accusations

506
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,720
and in general they they spread fear

507
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,000
and intimidation

508
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,039
so this is how they reacted and

509
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,240
now we're gonna come to the

510
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,360
parapolis term where it comes from so

511
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,720
the author

512
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,200
uh of the term is watson bender

513
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,120
who was a politician he lived here in

514
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,679
prague

515
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,039
i i sat at a table where the charter 77

516
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,480
was written

517
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,799
his wife is kamela benduva is still

518
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,159
alive so

519
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,360
we interviewed her a couple of times and

520
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,480
it was really interesting to see because

521
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
at their family table a very part very

522
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,720
big part of

523
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,520
czech history happened and one of one of

524
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,799
them was

525
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,159
that the charter 77 was written there

526
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,080
so so he was kind of a key person

527
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,600
in the movement he was mathematician and

528
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,720
philosopher

529
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,080
and all his interest can be covered with

530
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,000
this triangle if you use the parapolis

531
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,279
symbolics which was catholicism politics

532
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,120
and philosophy so these were three

533
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,240
top topics of vassal bender

534
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,480
which tells you that he was a deeply

535
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,440
believing

536
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,840
catholic uh who who

537
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,039
uh always imprinted his uh christianity

538
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,400
to his texts

539
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,240
with philosophy and so on

540
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,760
and uh what what bender openly was

541
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,120
was also he wanted to be the kind of a

542
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,559
kind of a leader of the movement um

543
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,080
uh he also hoped that if the regime

544
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,279
fails fails one day which he

545
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,880
really believed in uh and there was not

546
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,279
many

547
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,720
there were not many people who really

548
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,039
believed that the the regime will fail

549
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,440
but

550
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,720
he was one of them and he hoped that he

551
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,520
will be

552
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,559
the vats love but but not the havel who

553
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,440
finally become

554
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
became the political leader but he

555
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,159
wanted to be the boss of harold

556
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,279
which he finally didn't

557
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,080
didn't become and one of the reason

558
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
probably is that

559
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,960
uh in country where is the highest trait

560
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,360
of non-believers uh uh and a taste

561
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,320
it's it's uh quite difficult to become a

562
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,120
leader

563
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,039
with with a catholic program

564
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,279
so now where

565
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,840
how it happened um vassal bender

566
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,679
in 1978 started to realize that

567
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,960
uh behind charter 77 movement there are

568
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
some patterns

569
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,240
uh of the behavior of the movement that

570
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,520
show us some some

571
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,600
interesting phenomena and the phenomena

572
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,039
is that

573
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,640
uh as as a

574
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,919
as an act of uh self

575
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,360
protection and survival in the

576
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,840
in the environment of the oppression

577
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,960
they had to start

578
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,279
to behave in a different way and take

579
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,000
different

580
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,600
tactics and uh vassal bender

581
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,679
was describing the tactics the

582
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,880
strategies

583
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,120
and he covered those strategies with the

584
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,640
name of pearl police

585
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,840
so what is pearl police according to

586
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,799
bender

587
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,520
is a set of strategies that the movement

588
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,080
take

589
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,360
took to protect against the uh against

590
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,799
the totality

591
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,159
and uh to to create

592
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,480
an environment that is not in clash in

593
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,919
direct clash with the

594
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,279
government but uh creates

595
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,880
our its own uh social structures that

596
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,679
work

597
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,440
beside the official one and

598
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,640
uh it's also interesting to see uh

599
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,600
the two words to take a look at them so

600
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,640
first

601
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,000
police what does it mean because uh

602
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,799
very frequently people think like polly

603
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,520
is like

604
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,000
like the the state police so you're

605
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
joking of fritz

606
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,480
or or what no it's it's a police

607
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,840
in the old uh greek ter the old greek

608
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,640
term

609
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,159
that refers to uh

610
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,799
ancient police so-called city-state is

611
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,320
the

612
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,760
like most frequent uh term you you

613
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,039
you realized but uh but

614
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,679
of course the police also developed it

615
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,080
uh

616
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,480
it appeared around 800 before christ

617
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,480
uh as as the population of greece grew

618
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,760
uh so uh there started to

619
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,200
appear more and more police uh

620
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,240
these city-states which created some

621
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,159
basic organizational structure of the

622
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,840
society

623
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,440
so police is basically a

624
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,080
basic social structure we we might say

625
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,679
also community

626
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,039
so the basic unit of of the of the

627
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,200
society uh what is also important there

628
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,159
is is the

629
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,000
is the personal identification with the

630
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,240
police so i am the part of the police

631
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,960
where

632
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,679
in the greek times originally there were

633
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,880
tribes

634
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,919
but but what happened was that

635
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,279
with the with the rise of police uh the

636
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,640
tribe system

637
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,360
uh was changed into the identification

638
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,919
with the

639
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,440
with the police more than with the

640
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
tribes

641
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,880
and uh what was the primary

642
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,919
uh visible character of police was that

643
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,120
every police has had its own army its

644
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,159
own laws

645
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,840
and its own set of gods

646
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,960
then the word parallel was also also

647
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,320
interesting to take a look at the

648
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,360
etymology

649
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,320
because very frequently people think

650
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
that it's something alternative

651
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,279
something something derived from

652
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,960
uh from the main thing so we we take the

653
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,760
official main thing and we just create

654
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,679
some fork of it or so

655
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,880
but parallel uh doesn't mean

656
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,159
alternative it means

657
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,039
it's also from greek is a para means

658
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,799
alongside something

659
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,960
something something out of i would say

660
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,159
in aleos uh

661
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,919
is one another so so we see the differ

662
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,960
the total differentiate the

663
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,080
likes of the subjects so it's always

664
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,120
something totally

665
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,559
separate um

666
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,679
it's also interesting to see other other

667
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,240
definitions of parallel which is never

668
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,440
meeting however far

669
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,279
extended but have the same direction

670
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,559
so this is this is uh the term parallel

671
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,320
police

672
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,399
and when we come back to what's left

673
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,679
bender

674
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,159
so what what were the main pillars or

675
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,320
the principles of parapolis according to

676
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,720
so the basically what it is

677
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,080
is creating of autonomous

678
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,120
social and other structures that

679
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,320
are independent and beside

680
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,480
work beside official regime or other

681
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,200
authorities

682
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,200
he also named some um

683
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,279
some parts of or some pillars of the

684
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,720
parallel polish that

685
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,840
that were uh characteristic for the

686
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,880
charter 77 movement one of the

687
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,200
one of the most important word the

688
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,480
plural education

689
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,120
then of course parallel economy parallel

690
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,760
culture

691
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,300
the second culture

692
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,960
[Music]

693
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,760
then it was the principle of active

694
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,520
civil rights protection

695
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,640
they had their own information system

696
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,600
called samisdat which was like uh

697
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,720
organically

698
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,760
uh or we could say peer-to-peer

699
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,200
uh spreading of uh publications

700
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,480
and and other information and

701
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,559
they claims to have several

702
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,880
international relationships

703
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,320
uh also uh foreign policy we might say

704
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,000
uh so these were these were those that

705
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,360
were characteristic for charter 77

706
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,559
but what is important and and uh bender

707
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,519
bender expressed this as it in the essay

708
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,080
is that

709
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,360
these are only some examples and

710
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,880
there is not any limit or or some rule

711
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,760
why propolis couldn't do

712
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,960
many other other things and operate on

713
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,320
other fields

714
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,200
so it's usually it's always depends on

715
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,600
the

716
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,440
circumstances environment era culture

717
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,640
and so on what uh

718
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,720
what the parapolis in this exact

719
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,159
condition is

720
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,279
is if you remember the

721
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,279
the examples from other countries

722
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,600
so the pearl police in hungary in

723
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,399
hungary

724
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,399
was totally different of parapolis in

725
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,919
czechoslovakia it was totally different

726
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:06,480
to

727
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,720
paropolis in sloven in poland sorry

728
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,640
and later as the the term was discussed

729
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,480
within the dissident movement

730
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,240
uh the other authors like vaslav havel

731
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,519
shimechi and others uh elaborated

732
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,559
some some idea what is the goal of

733
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,519
parallel police

734
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,080
because otherwise it was just an

735
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,440
description of

736
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,919
of strategy like for example crypto

737
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,360
anarchy is

738
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,399
but the the the arc articulated goal of

739
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,480
prior police which is independent

740
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,519
society

741
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,360
and it sounds very general so what does

742
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,960
it mean and i

743
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,720
i love the most the vassal of other

744
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
definition

745
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,000
which is very idealistic but it says

746
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,200
that

747
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,880
independent society means that wherever

748
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,240
the civil society can organize itself

749
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,600
this the state should make the step back

750
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,840
like okay you are able to organize by

751
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,000
yourself

752
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,120
i give up my rules and my authority and

753
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,360
leave it up to you so the ideal state

754
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,240
co-living with pearl police would always

755
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,440
make the step back

756
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,320
when the self-organization is able to

757
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,919
govern

758
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,360
our own things without the state

759
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,918
authority

760
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,000
so now maybe it's a good question to us

761
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,279
so what can be

762
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,679
palace is it only the house in holla

763
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,880
chavitsa

764
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,720
or in vienna or in bratislava as it used

765
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,760
to be

766
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,159
or what what can be what all can be

767
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,600
parapolis

768
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,799
and not long time ago we had a very

769
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,679
interesting

770
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,760
interview with smuggler and frank brown

771
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,519
on their podcast with stream

772
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,799
cyberpunk and

773
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,200
we discussed there that parapolis

774
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,559
probably is just some

775
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,919
expression of something that is

776
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,440
deeply in our human gene in our human

777
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,119
nature

778
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,918
because when we apply the principles of

779
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,599
parallel police back to the

780
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,719
historical historical effects

781
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,079
we can see that in in history many times

782
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,599
uh wherever whenever the state power

783
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,119
grew too much there were created some

784
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,079
kind of parastructures and that's why i

785
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,079
placed here this image that i really

786
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:36,960
like

787
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,159
um it's it's uh it's an image from the

788
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,440
asian rome

789
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,800
this this uh up on the ground

790
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,239
it is the rome empire and the and the

791
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,918
governance

792
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,879
by the roman empire and here under the

793
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:53,280
ground

794
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,480
are the catacombs uh that

795
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,920
that you can visit especially in rome uh

796
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,240
which were occupied by the first

797
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,200
christians

798
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,919
after uh after the um

799
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,279
bc simply

800
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,560
and as you probably remember from

801
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,520
history

802
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
the first christians during the first

803
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,359
three centuries

804
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,880
after christ were illegal and chased and

805
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,000
haunted by the by the rome

806
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,280
imperial power so they had to operate

807
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,920
totally illegally and their strategy was

808
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,800
that they

809
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,320
dick into the ground and created under

810
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,520
like truly underground uh cities

811
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,960
or catacombs it's it's it's called

812
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,599
so even even back in history to 2000

813
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,440
years ago we can see some expressions of

814
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,880
of need in this case to to freely

815
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,839
express my

816
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,560
religious preferences

817
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,000
and it can of course also be

818
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,640
uh something that will happen in future

819
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,240
i i chose an example of

820
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,920
uh of parapolis 3-0 which is a concept

821
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,720
described by yuray badnar who is having

822
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,839
parallel talk right now

823
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,839
and i recommend to read it if you

824
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,119
haven't

825
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,160
it's on the website of slovak police

826
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,280
parallel now police.sk

827
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,359
and it's it's an idea how a parapolis

828
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,000
concept could develop for future not to

829
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,119
be dependent on

830
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,240
physical space physical premises so

831
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,359
he proposes kind of a fluid structure

832
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,240
which anyways uh anyway is happening as

833
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,560
as

834
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,800
other parapolis and in different forms

835
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,320
are growing

836
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,200
uh not only in czech republic

837
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,599
so uh this this is uh this is some final

838
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,000
thought that i would like to propose and

839
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,119
uh i would like you to think about

840
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,200
uh and learn from history because

841
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,320
maybe some form of parapolis is some

842
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,480
kind of anthropological constant

843
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,760
something that is common for

844
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,280
all humans all human beings and we can

845
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,599
see

846
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,320
throughout history that that uh some

847
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,400
forms of parapolis happen

848
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,040
and we can learn from the strategies we

849
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,000
can see

850
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,280
uh even now in the world when we when we

851
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,599
take a look to different regimes that

852
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,800
that things are happening there when you

853
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,880
take a look to north korea you can see

854
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,520
that

855
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,119
there are youth smuggling

856
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,480
into this north korea

857
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,400
culture especially from south korea but

858
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,000
from from other countries as well and

859
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,920
even though the region did a really

860
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,040
really good job

861
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,320
in brainwashing the people they didn't

862
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,119
succeed

863
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,320
some some some basic need

864
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,520
for freedom remained even in this north

865
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,640
korean

866
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,200
regime and some versions of parapolis we

867
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,480
probably don't know about

868
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,680
now are happening there as well

869
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,040
so it's my call to

870
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,400
to study history and search for parallel

871
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,599
policies

872
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,359
and principles and inspiration for this

873
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,480
so i would like to end up with this

874
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,160
with what what i've uh what i've started

875
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,880
with

876
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,079
and it's the moment when uh i was

877
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,280
talking to my friend

878
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,400
about crypto technologies bitcoin

879
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,760
decentralization and so on and he as

880
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,480
political think political scientists

881
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,040
realized the connection

882
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,240
some some relation to the to the

883
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,119
historical

884
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,760
point from seventies to pearl polish the

885
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,200
concept

886
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,560
uh and and he proposed that and for me

887
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,240
this is very interesting

888
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,760
moment because it connects some

889
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,280
some very small piece of our history

890
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,400
with uh something that is happening now

891
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,960
and which was the very grain and seat

892
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,920
of this concept we are participating on

893
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
now

894
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,599
so thank you very much for your

895
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,050
attention thank you very much

896
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,249
[Applause]

897
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,880
do we have any questions raise your hand

898
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,839
please

899
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,079
could you please tell a bit more about

900
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,680
the future

901
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,599
the visions for parallel police

902
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,200
sorry that's a very good question uh

903
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,440
because recently police is going through

904
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,599
very dramatic changes you probably saw

905
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,520
that slovak parapolis has closed down

906
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,800
it was not feasible to to keep

907
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,440
the premise they they found

908
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,960
uh bratislava slovakia uh

909
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,720
there was pro police for two years or

910
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,000
three years

911
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,680
um another parallel police was

912
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,599
established last year in vienna

913
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,920
operates totally independently in a very

914
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,119
nice way

915
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,760
and there are other groups uh like in

916
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,640
kosciutz

917
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,000
and other places they

918
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,200
somehow want to uh

919
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,680
deal with this what what we've done here

920
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,640
and

921
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,839
continue with it and follow it up but

922
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,480
even even this this project this this

923
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,280
like first

924
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,560
police i would call it uh goes through

925
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,359
changes

926
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,640
uh which which are organizational which

927
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,119
are

928
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,319
related of course to to uh

929
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,000
needs to create different model

930
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,680
different business model for

931
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,119
for operations such of such a big house

932
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,800
and there is also this concept of

933
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,720
parapolis 3-0

934
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,079
like a new new version that wouldn't be

935
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,160
that much bind to to physical premises

936
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,800
to some like institution in the physical

937
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,680
way

938
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,119
but uh could could provide us

939
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,280
some tools to to uh

940
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,240
to cooperate and and work together in

941
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,359
another way

942
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,200
which i think is very important for

943
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,960
future because what is happening in the

944
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,560
world now and it's the topic of this

945
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,599
congress

946
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,960
is that

947
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,599
accidentally the situation can get much

948
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,720
worse

949
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,319
and even keeping the physical space

950
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,599
might be too big obstacle due to some

951
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,599
operation repression whatever

952
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,119
from the site of the state and

953
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,280
we have to be ready for a moment when we

954
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,119
won't have won't be able to operate a

955
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,000
physical space

956
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,079
charter 77 also didn't have their own

957
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,680
coffee and co-working

958
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,880
and and so on because it wouldn't be

959
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,680
possible

960
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,720
simply and we have to get ready for

961
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,800
for a moment when when it won't be

962
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,920
possible to operate

963
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,440
in this nice way anymore and i think the

964
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,839
concept purpose 3o is exactly the

965
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,560
the way the direction

966
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,079
uh that that is interesting to to take

967
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,800
to talk about

968
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,680
have you thought about um trying to

969
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,119
reach some billionaire

970
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,319
um like some some billionaire

971
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,079
um billionaire yeah like peter thiel

972
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,520
and and um or some foundation i mean

973
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,880
which

974
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,640
could theoretically i mean more easily

975
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,000
add funds and i think these principles

976
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,839
are set from the very beginning

977
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,520
uh very clearly there are different

978
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,319
kinds of memberships in parapolis uh and

979
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:14,960
one of them

980
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,000
is so-called board of donors the highest

981
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,359
uh way of of

982
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,839
of member members or not highest but the

983
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,800
most generous i would say and

984
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,760
these people pay a quite significant

985
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,720
amount

986
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,839
per month i think it's like 700

987
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,400
euros 600 euros something like this per

988
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,000
month

989
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,920
but the point is that nobody can pay

990
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,359
more they

991
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,720
they have like uh strictly done

992
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,440
uh set up the the fee the the membership

993
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,800
fee they pay

994
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,599
so uh which we should protect the

995
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,560
organization from one general partner

996
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,000
who will donate us lots of money one

997
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,480
year

998
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,040
so so the organization starts to operate

999
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,560
with different budget

1000
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,200
and another year he can say ah if you

1001
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,160
don't do this

1002
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,359
thing that i like i will stop my funding

1003
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,520
which can be fatal for the organization

1004
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,240
so so that's the principle how we

1005
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,880
reach the money of let's say more

1006
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,880
wealthy people

1007
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,079
but but

1008
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,000
of course it's living organism and

1009
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,200
things can change

1010
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,839
in future i don't exclude it

1011
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,440
yeah sorry there's another question so

1012
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,960
we can get back to you

1013
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,000
if there are any other

1014
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,599
so at this moment would you say that

1015
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,000
parallel new police community is

1016
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,040
more has more of a physical presence

1017
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,520
or online presence if you should compare

1018
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,680
it

1019
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,800
it definitely was more about physical

1020
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,920
presence

1021
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,000
and i think that during the last year it

1022
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,560
takes

1023
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,760
a serious important lesson

1024
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,560
that being depended on the physical

1025
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,920
presence only is not the good way so i

1026
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,440
think now this congress

1027
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,800
is exactly good good example how

1028
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,119
how the things evolve how do you think

1029
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,839
evolves and

1030
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:21,200
uh um and i i can't imagine that

1031
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,319
that it would come back uh to physical

1032
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,079
premises only

1033
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,040
presence uh i think the the online would

1034
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,359
be more and more important of course

1035
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,240
the other questions

1036
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,359
just to add on the idea i mentioned

1037
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,400
before about the

1038
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,680
billionaires because i think that

1039
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,839
there are many people some people or

1040
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,200
many many people in the

1041
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,079
in the crypto space which um made a lot

1042
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:52,800
of money

1043
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,480
with rising crypto prices some didn't

1044
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,000
i mean some even had losses because of

1045
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,440
unfortunate things like mt gox and

1046
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,280
etc um but

1047
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,599
i recently saw some article also that

1048
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,319
the number of

1049
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,960
of bitcoin uh billionaires is or um

1050
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,920
multi-millionaires is like again rising

1051
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,880
very much and

1052
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,800
so um maybe

1053
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,160
we have through networking we can reach

1054
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,920
to such people and maybe if um

1055
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,520
for one time because of corona also um

1056
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,079
you could set a clear rule like okay

1057
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,000
this time we will accept

1058
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,680
larger donations um but um

1059
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,400
with absolutely no interference of

1060
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:44,880
course

1061
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,920
in the operations because

1062
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,200
um i think that at least a part of these

1063
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,319
um very rich people now um

1064
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,680
they um if we um

1065
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,040
made them become very aware that

1066
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,920
they only did

1067
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,440
get this money because of satoshi and

1068
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,720
and all the others

1069
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,000
who contributed um then

1070
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,960
i think this is such a great place and

1071
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,160
um

1072
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,720
such many good great things come out of

1073
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,160
here so that uh

1074
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,720
um this is very nice to hear of course

1075
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,280
uh donations are always nice

1076
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,480
but what's what is much more valuable

1077
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,839
and sustainable is uh when the when the

1078
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,160
organization is able to create the

1079
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,079
fundings itself

1080
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,200
so so i think this this should be still

1081
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,480
the main focus

1082
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,880
how to be totally independent on the

1083
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,200
nations and then the nations can be

1084
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,480
nice to have uh edon or

1085
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,079
or some network that that

1086
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,200
protects you from total fall in case of

1087
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,240
some critical situations uh then

1088
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,280
some donator who helps not to fall to

1089
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,400
the ground

1090
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,440
can be of course uh important and

1091
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,680
in other player policies in history of

1092
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,559
course

1093
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,599
it was uh very very important as well

1094
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,359
uh the the frequently uh

1095
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,599
uh frequently uh quoted

1096
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,440
soros the this this big uh

1097
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,400
donor one of the biggest in the world uh

1098
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,359
also supported

1099
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,680
charter 77 uh in the 70s and 80s so

1100
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,078
so yeah we can see lots of pearls

1101
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,440
with history as well but not not for our

1102
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,240
policy he didn't fund purpose

1103
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,680
as far as i know there's

1104
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,680
one more question last question i

1105
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,160
appreciate

1106
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,000
um this year there's the the

1107
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,200
online version and the physical version

1108
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,920
and also in previous years i'm sure you

1109
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,280
recorded a lot of the

1110
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,079
the content so now it's kind of it's not

1111
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,240
just like a physical thing because it's

1112
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,240
um people are experiencing in real time

1113
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,359
anywhere and we just spoke about

1114
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,200
like a sustainable way of surviving like

1115
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,040
in a material sense

1116
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,160
what's your plan or

1117
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,720
vision for you know this content or the

1118
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,640
stuff that's being generated

1119
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,800
um like does does that relate in some

1120
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,559
way to um

1121
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,640
to sustainable way of like for example

1122
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,079
you could have like a library of content

1123
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,440
that you pay to access or

1124
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,319
like there's this um now that you have

1125
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:46,800
the

1126
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,920
the valuable stuff in in in this form

1127
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,960
and and you're open to uh you know

1128
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,160
opening it to the world you don't have

1129
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,079
to be here like how how do these two

1130
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,359
relate or do they relate

1131
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,760
in your vision i'm not the person in

1132
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,480
charge

1133
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,520
for this uh i i

1134
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,480
am since since may i'm not member of of

1135
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,440
the

1136
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,839
of the leadership of this organization

1137
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,319
uh

1138
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,680
so it's not in my hands anymore but

1139
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,440
uh as far as i know the slovak

1140
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,000
model will be followed so slovak

1141
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,200
parallel police create

1142
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,720
a paid zone for for

1143
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,920
courses and and lectures and so on that

1144
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,319
happened in pearl police physically

1145
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,440
so you you cannot access all the content

1146
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,640
for free

1147
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,880
but there is some paid zone and i think

1148
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,079
this makes sense

1149
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,680
because it worked pretty well uh

1150
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,040
in slovakia uh so so i think this

1151
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,400
this should be followed um

1152
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,079
as well and the ex and the user

1153
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,760
experience with the hop-in with the tool

1154
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,559
for the for the

1155
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,359
for this congress is quite nice i'm

1156
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,440
positively surprised

1157
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,640
how nice it works so i i think that's

1158
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,000
that's exactly the way how to do stuff

1159
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,110
[Music]

1160
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:18,870
[Applause]
