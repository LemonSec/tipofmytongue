the last presentation

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,480
today's highlight

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,240
smuggler when you see all these people

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,760
what do you see

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,439

exactly

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,599
hitler and frank they started to wear a

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,039
mask

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,200
many years before it was cool

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,920
and all we had to do and now we can see

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
now you can see

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
thanks to thanks to covet we have like a

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,200
better anonymity set

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
yes yes i'm thankful and you look

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,920
beautiful

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,000
okay so

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,380
[Laughter]

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,840
[Music]

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,199
okay so short information for all those

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,160
people

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,479
who uh don't know smuggler smuggler is

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,200
the crypto anarchist cypherpunk from

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,119
germany

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,600
uh together with frank brown they have

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,640
many

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,479
common projects the recent one is called

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,040
cypherpunk beach a cypherpunk bitstream

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,640
podcast

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
and this is one this is not it's the

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,840
best

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,240
like a crypto acoustic podcast i know

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,479
strongly recommended to to to

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,479
to check this podcast and on this

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,560
podcast uh

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,680
you you had a lot of interesting

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,079
talks about black market for example uh

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,520
it was i think it was you

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,079
i read the paper about drop agent

41
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,320
okay uh and drop edges is pretty unique

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,759
concept

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,880
and i think in your presentation black

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,360
marsh

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,119
black market logistic you will explain

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,640
exactly what is it so welcome here

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,840
smuggler

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,960
thank you

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,680
[Applause]

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,959
uh hello and if you're expecting any

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,959
jokes i'm not making any jokes today

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,720
because frank told me that i have new

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,680
humor so

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
it will be only content blame him

55
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,520
so today i'm going to talk about black

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,360
market logistics

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,080
because the best way to fix the state is

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,640
to circumvent it

59
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,239
and why talk about logistics

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,680
in general you know there are many

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,000
topics but what does make

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,360
logistics important well there's a thing

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,920
that

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,440
the state injects itself into processes

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,160
between

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,920
us and other people all the time

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,599
and you have um an easy thing like money

68
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,879
you know bitcoin we use that uh to help

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,959
a little bit with the topic

70
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,840
we have that with communication we have

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,720
anonymizing communication tor i2p

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,120
and stuff like that and then there are

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
two aspects that are really

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,000
difficult to solve and that is

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,760
the state's involvement with uh

76
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
territory and the state's involvement

77
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,680
with logistics and

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,400
trade and since i like to

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
think about things that make me freer

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,760
and maybe somebody else freer

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,280
logistics is my topic for this year

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,560
so what are the goals of this

83
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
talk that i'm giving so number one i

84
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
just want to celebrate the ingenuity

85
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
that a lot of black market logistics

86
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,920
operators have um

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,879
i want to help people to understand what

88
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,400
the reality of black market logistics is

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,599
because one thing i i noticed um

90
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,720
when coming here is there were a lot of

91
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
people like saying oh we're

92
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,799
we're in this big totalitarian thing

93
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,360
what do we do now with coed and

94
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,480
borders are closed and everything we're

95
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,439
doomed

96
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,400
you know but there's black market

97
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,159
logistics might help with that and give

98
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,720
you a little bit of hope

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,918
then i would like to inspire innovation

100
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,839
because black market logistics is

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,519
something that most hackers and

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,639
engineers never

103
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,280
think about but it's an interesting

104
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,120
problem field

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,560
and then um the the whole question of

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
black market logistics

107
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
has systemic systematic

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,040
consequences because if you can control

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,160
logistics

110
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
it's a little bit less of state in our

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,800
life and the whole talk will be given

112
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,919
as um art performance for educational

113
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,600
purposes

114
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,880
so i'm the character of smuggler

115
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,639
a black market logistics consultant

116
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,520
but of course it's only educational i'm

117
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
not giving any actual advice

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
consult your lawyers before you do

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
anything

120
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,560
the talk has four aspects we'll talk

121
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
about the context and key

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,479
factors of logistics in general we're

123
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,160
talking about a few classical

124
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,520
methods that are used the main risks

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,680
and threats to black market logistics

126
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,479
and a little bit of awesome future

127
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
technology that is not that far in the

128
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
future

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,000
so let's begin what is logistics

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
logistics is the management of flow of

131
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,440
resources from

132
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
the point of origin to the point of

133
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,039
consumption according to the

134
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,240
requirements of the consumer or merchant

135
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
get something from a to b when you want

136
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
something from a to b that is logistics

137
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,880
and in a black market logistics is if

138
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
that environment through which you

139
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,520
transport your goods is hostile

140
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,919
meaning that people want to intercept

141
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,800
your goods

142
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
or manipulate them destroy them

143
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,840
or poison them or stuff like that

144
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,960
so in logistics there are a few key

145
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,000
factors

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,960
that determine if you're doing your job

147
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
well

148
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,639
the first one is reliability and that is

149
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,199
actually the

150
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,759
the main focus of logistics is

151
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,039
reliability

152
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,960
and that is you want a defined quantity

153
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,919
defined quality at a defined time at a

154
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
defined place

155
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
if you're not able to define those four

156
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
things and accomplish them then you're

157
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
not in logistics but in random

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,319
distribution

159
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,319
the second thing is cost of course

160
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,840
if you want to bring every single sample

161
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,759
to the customer store

162
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,199
directly from the producer the cost of

163
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,240
transport will be

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
so high that you cannot ship anything

165
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,440
anymore that is why we have unit loads

166
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,599
which means that we try to fulfill

167
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,000
as many orders as possible with one

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,880
action

169
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,319
and that drives the per-unit costs down

170
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,599
that explains why most logistic networks

171
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,240
are habit spoke networks so you

172
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
concentrate

173
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,720
shipments to a certain point you create

174
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,080
a unit load out of it

175
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,599
you ship it somewhere else and then you

176
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,919
split it up again that is how parcels

177
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,160
work for example

178
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,759
and then in a hostile environment you

179
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,520
have the probability of detection

180
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,840
at the cost of intercept that is the

181
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,520
the thing that is different from white

182
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
market logistics in white market

183
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,759
logistics nothing happens ever

184
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,520
in black market logistics you have

185
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,880
actors

186
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,039
that want to get your goods they have to

187
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,199
detect them for that

188
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
and then even if they detect it they

189
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,879
still have to get it so detection and

190
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,400
interception is actually not the same

191
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,080
thing

192
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,090
and why is that important

193
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,440
[Music]

194
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,520
i'm actually not talking about drug

195
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,199
shipments here there are a lot of

196
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,560
reasons why smuggling is useful

197
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
um number one the military is doing it

198
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,759
all the time

199
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,080
you need that in war you know you have

200
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,400
to you win a war with logistics

201
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
including

202
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,080
logistics where the enemy is trying to

203
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
undermine your logistics

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,639
then intelligence agencies do it all the

205
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,400
time

206
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,840
you do it in the context of anti-piracy

207
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520
that is actually where the

208
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,000
white market logistics and black market

209
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,399
logistics intersect

210
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,479
sometimes you have high value goods that

211
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,399
you don't want to fall into the hands of

212
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,440
pirates

213
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
and then you are using smuggling

214
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,958
techniques to prevent that among other

215
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,799
things

216
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,120
during the corona covet whatever

217
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,000
pandemic thing

218
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,680
we had a lot of states that were

219
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,279
reintroduced to the concept of piracy

220
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,399
because a lot of ppe shipments like

221
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,040
masks

222
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,240
whatever were intercepted by

223
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
pass-through states so the germans did

224
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,240
that a couple of times

225
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
they stole the masks from the swiss

226
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,120
people and stuff like that so

227
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,560
they should have used a little bit more

228
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,480
black market techniques the swiss people

229
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,040
i mean not the germans

230
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
and then black market logistics are

231
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
always important for total

232
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,480
empty totalitarian states because

233
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
imagine you're in a totalitarian state

234
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,959
that is preventing certain medication to

235
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,680
come to you

236
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,640
like heart medication and you need

237
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,399
smugglers to survive

238
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,760
that is actually where my love for the

239
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
subject comes from

240
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,680
because that's what my parents did i

241
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,360
didn't understand it back then but

242
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,600
in hindsight my parents were smugglers

243
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,519
good smugglers you know good ones you

244
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,480
know only like

245
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,240
legal drugs that never might

246
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,240
so um there are three

247
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,399
key factors for the cost of interception

248
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,680
so if a shipment gets intercepted on

249
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,880
black market

250
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,760
logistics there are three things you can

251
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,480
lose

252
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,959
of course the goods they've hurt

253
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,120
sometimes

254
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,560
but there's also people and equipment so

255
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,359
and what happens in the whole scene to

256
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,200
to optimize this risk is you can either

257
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,000
optimize

258
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,040
for goods and equipment

259
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,320
or you can optimize for goods and people

260
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,079
i mean you have to always optimize for

261
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,720
goods because that's your job

262
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,480
but do you want to give up people or do

263
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,079
you want to give up equipment

264
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,600
and the sad truth is

265
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
that a lot of smuggling is optimized for

266
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:48,959
equipment

267
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,320
meaning that people don't matter

268
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,000
and that leads to so-called mules

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,839
being stacked in prison because they're

270
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,040
transporting cocaine and stuff like that

271
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,760
so-called ant networks and amp networks

272
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,000
are

273
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,240
a very inhumane way to smuggle goods

274
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,320
because you're burning stupid people

275
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,399
but if you optimize for goods and people

276
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,320
then the interesting topic for us comes

277
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,279
into play that is technology

278
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,839
so let's see what the current methods of

279
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,519
smuggling are

280
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,640
so you can smuggle

281
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,720
in three domains basically you could

282
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,399
smuggle through the air

283
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,560
through land or on land or under land

284
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,200
and the seas of course like the oceans

285
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,240
so current methods for air is

286
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,360
the easiest thing is drops

287
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,079
you fly from a to b with your goods and

288
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,600
then there's

289
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
your customer below you somewhere and

290
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
you drop it out of the window

291
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,160
like simplified so

292
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,040
that is not very good for a lot of goods

293
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
you know you cannot drop

294
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,920
equipment that is easy to break

295
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,320
drops are often very easy to detect as

296
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,519
well

297
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,959
and it's a little bit old-school you

298
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,560
know so you could continue

299
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,519
buckets what is a bucket if you have an

300
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,639
airplane

301
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,200
and you have a long line coming out of

302
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,240
it

303
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,760
with a weight and then you circle

304
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,279
the airplane one thing that happens is

305
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,040
that this weight is drawn into the

306
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,320
middle of the circle

307
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,519
and it becomes static that means that

308
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,000
you can

309
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,959
lower this line down to the ground to

310
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:41,360
both

311
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,399
deliver and pick up stuff so that is

312
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,440
the bucket technique the problem with

313
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,040
the bucket technique is i mean the good

314
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,800
thing is you don't need to drop your

315
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,320
 and break it you don't need to land

316
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
but everybody can see that because

317
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,560
there's stuff like radar

318
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
and if you have like a small airplane

319
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,040
going in circles for half an hour

320
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,959
everybody is going to be suspicious

321
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,519
about that

322
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,519
then there's this cut out and breakout

323
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,880
method

324
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,680
so when you're doing international

325
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,079
flights

326
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,920
you have a flight plan and a flight

327
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,880
manifest that basically says

328
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,240
i'm going from a to b and

329
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,120
this is my route this is the airport

330
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,240
they're going to start this is the

331
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,200
airport i'm going to land

332
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,519
but in reality that is just your

333
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,920
announcement it's not the law

334
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,360
so it means that if you decide to

335
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,760
land somewhere else as well you can do

336
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,600
that no

337
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,920
and with color breakouts that actually

338
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,000
means that you're flying from a to b

339
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,839
and you're just taking another landing

340
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,440
in between for refill for example

341
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
and then you exchange your goods there

342
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,560
so

343
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,440
and that works relatively well in africa

344
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,920
it doesn't work that well in germany so

345
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,279
but the main effective method for

346
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,600
smuggling with the air today

347
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,680
is ultralights so ultralights are these

348
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,160
very small

349
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
it's not an airplane it's this very

350
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,320
small flying thing where a person sits

351
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
in

352
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
and they can fly very low and they're

353
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,600
very

354
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
slow but they're

355
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,199
because they can fly this low um they

356
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,240
usually don't

357
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,279
appear on radar for example

358
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,120
and ultra lights are very cheap so

359
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
they're like 10 to

360
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,160
30 000 us dollars like a usual plane is

361
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,839
a little bit more money

362
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,240
ultra light is cheap and if your pilot

363
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,519
is less weighty than i am

364
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,120
you have a lot of cargo that he can

365
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,720
carry with him

366
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,639
and ultralights are actually the main

367
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,480
smuggling method

368
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,839
by air over the mexican us

369
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,959
border it's basically ultraflights

370
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,199
ultralights with cocaine flying north

371
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,839
landing in the desert being abandoned

372
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,800
that's it

373
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,920
so ultralights

374
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,000
land because

375
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,920
we are land people we always think about

376
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,079
smuggling over the land

377
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,079
the most common method is the

378
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,279
concealment method

379
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,519
so you have a truck or whatever you have

380
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,399
hidden compartments maybe even in it

381
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,040
and you put your goods into that and the

382
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,639
interesting thing is that it's one of

383
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,079
those technologies

384
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,720
that has been specifically made illegal

385
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,800
in most countries

386
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,360
so having a car that has uh hidden

387
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,199
compartments

388
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,880
is illegal in a lot of countries

389
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,800
including the u.s canada and stuff like

390
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,759
that

391
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,440
but it's the main method and

392
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,800
when you read the news there are a lot

393
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,000
of cases where cars are stopped and then

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
they found a hidden compartment with a

395
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,040
million euros in there so

396
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,920
re-labeling relabeling is interesting

397
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,319
because

398
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,519
when you have a customs control officer

399
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,519
looking at something

400
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,560
how does he know what that something is

401
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,360
so what you can often do is you can ship

402
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,279
something from a to b

403
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,560
and when you send it out of a you claim

404
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,320
that it's good a

405
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,199
and then you ship it into b you say it's

406
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:31,839
good b

407
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,199
it's for example something that is done

408
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,160
for um trash smuggling because trash is

409
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,920
one of the most smuggled goods on the

410
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,560
planet

411
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,839
um so for example

412
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,639
you would export electronics out of the

413
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,279
eu

414
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,440
and claim that those electronics are for

415
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,480
sale

416
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,560
and good and then you come into africa

417
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,000
and then you re-label it as trash

418
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,040
and that means that in the eu

419
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,920
you don't have to follow any regulations

420
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,400
and

421
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,319
in africa you don't have to pay import

422
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,679
fees and usually relabeling is

423
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,919
only done for trash and stuff you want

424
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
to get rid of

425
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,039
switching is um actually not a real

426
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,640
concealment or

427
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,919
it's more tactic because what happens a

428
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,119
lot is that

429
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,400
the police knows that you have this

430
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
person on the route from a to b

431
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,760
and he's carrying something with him so

432
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,120
they wait in b for their person to

433
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,160
arrive

434
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,280
and then they search the person so what

435
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,000
you

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,559
want to do as a smuggler is to you want

437
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,720
to intersect that

438
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,679
by another travel that is for example

439
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,280
coming from d

440
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,480
and wants to to be and they switch the

441
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,280
goods or

442
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,000
exchange the goods while traveling it's

443
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,400
done

444
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
a lot for air travel actually

445
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,080
so smuggling in air travel you have that

446
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,440
switching a lot

447
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,400
because it means that the person coming

448
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,520
from a high risk

449
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,960
country comes into the target country

450
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
he's certainly has nothing but the other

451
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,360
person that comes from a low-risk

452
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,799
country and comes into the target

453
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,400
country is then actually carrying the

454
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,600
goods

455
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,360
so you have those moments on the

456
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,200
airplane where

457
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,720
two dudes go to the toilet together

458
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,039
and it's not what you think so

459
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,799
rerouting so because this is hacker

460
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,480
congress we already have to

461
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,679
to to talk about career opportunities

462
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,440
for hackers

463
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,919
rerouting is a career opportunity for

464
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,160
hackers

465
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,880
so imagine you have a shipping container

466
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,440
and

467
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,799
you put in there like goods

468
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,720
and you don't want to be caught how do

469
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
you get it from a to b without filing

470
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
the right reports

471
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,760
easy you hack the computers of the

472
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,000
shipping companies in between

473
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,360
and reroute the container so you file

474
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,320
the one thing you order a certain thing

475
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,919
then you basically switch containers

476
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,960
around and

477
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,760
change their names so that is actually

478
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
something that happens quite a lot

479
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,320
the dutch police is constantly looking

480
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,360
for people that do that

481
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,480
and it it has this nice

482
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,240
effect that you suddenly have people

483
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
that know about computers

484
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,120
that become these masses of logistics

485
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,640
and have to control hundreds of

486
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,440
containers

487
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,720
and simulate them and stuff like that

488
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,360
but the most common at least when it

489
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,640
comes to volume of good

490
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,280
method is rip on rip off it's about

491
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,679
shipping containers again

492
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,360
and it looks like this you have a

493
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,880
shipping container

494
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,039
by some legitimate seller

495
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,440
white market logistics and then you go

496
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,600
to the shipyard

497
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
you crack open the container you put

498
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,960
your own goods in there

499
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,200
you seal the container again then let it

500
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,480
be shipped

501
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,400
and then the destination you're looking

502
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,840
for the same container again you break

503
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
it open take off your goods

504
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,880
and you go so basically this is cocaine

505
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,640
and this is under variable i think so

506
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,280
this is this is the most common method

507
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,679
and it requires hackers

508
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,120
because you have to follow that

509
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,039
container you have to know when it

510
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,120
is in a certain place so these hackers

511
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,360
hack the shipping company computers all

512
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,240
the time

513
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,039
to track containers and also to take

514
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,840
them over

515
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,039
so basically they will send their own

516
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,080
drivers there

517
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,120
to pick up that container then empty it

518
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,520
out

519
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,840
and then send it back again so

520
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,159
and then it is the mexican border

521
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,200
so there are more ways of going over

522
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,080
borders especially

523
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,840
if you have a barrier so the classic one

524
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,640
is

525
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,960
digging tunnels everybody has heard that

526
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
it's a high investment

527
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
and it usually fails then you can

528
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,960
smuggle weird trucks and trailers um

529
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,760
it's done a lot has a high failure rate

530
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,200
because

531
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
you cannot really do that without the

532
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,559
driver being involved so you're giving

533
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,840
you're optimizing against people again

534
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,480
then catapult is a real thing you know

535
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,200
you have these

536
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,400
roman style catapults on the mexican

537
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,679
side

538
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,840
and then you throw it over it's very

539
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,000
efficient

540
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,840
it often destroys the goods though

541
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,559
and

542
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,520
and the targeting is actually not that i

543
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,919
mean in theory you could target it well

544
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,760
with a catapult but it's something they

545
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,080
haven't figured out that well

546
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
so you have those 20 people running

547
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,000
around searching for the last

548
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,200
thing that was thrown over so it's

549
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,760
there's work to be done but ramps ramps

550
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
is a real thing

551
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,480
you build a ramp out of steel you drive

552
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,159
20 cars over it

553
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,159
you're good to go it's fast efficient

554
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,240
unless you do the calculation wrong and

555
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,080
your thing gets stuck on the middle of

556
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,200
the border

557
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,440
well there's some loss involved always

558
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,919
i really don't like land smuggling and i

559
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,080
don't like air smuggling there are two

560
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,080
i don't know

561
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,120
not cool you know sea smuggling is cool

562
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,919
so how do you get cocaine from

563
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,440
south africa to china with a five

564
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,799
million dollar yacht

565
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,720
that is what almost all the cocaine

566
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,240
comes from uh it's the same thing to

567
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,200
austria and

568
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,480
australia and stuff it's private yachts

569
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,360
filled with cocaine and you just hope to

570
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,080
be not

571
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,400
caught and that is that is kind of

572
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,919
brazen

573
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,240
but also um not cool

574
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,559
drop-offs and drop-ons that that is the

575
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,320
classical method it's hundreds of years

576
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,039
old

577
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,520
and that is really easy you have a big

578
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,880
ship

579
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,080
international waters illegal goods

580
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,320
you push the illegal goods from the big

581
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,280
ship

582
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,080
and then if it's a drop off there's

583
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,919
water down there and if it's a drop on

584
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,039
there's a smaller ship

585
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,240
down there so that's the difference

586
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,400
between off and on

587
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,520
so drop off drop on today

588
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,679
is something that is really developed

589
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,400
i'll come to a picture of that later

590
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,640
but today that actually means you have

591
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,200
this bundle of goods

592
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,760
and a tracker device and satellite

593
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,720
connections

594
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,400
and beacons and homing devices and it's

595
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,279
really cool

596
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,840
technology-wise if you're an electronics

597
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,400
person

598
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,159
there's a market i'm just saying that so

599
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,720
submersibles and semi-submersibles if

600
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
you're into bigger tools you can build

601
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
boats

602
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,480
that float just below the waterline or

603
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,880
that are actually diving

604
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
and that's the thing that the um

605
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,799
colombian cattells

606
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,080
are specialized in um

607
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,559
they started by getting a few russians

608
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,279
that were

609
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,640
in the ship building industry

610
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,840
and um when the soviet union fell those

611
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,640
people needed jobs

612
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,200
you build boats right it's just a boat

613
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,480
so and then

614
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,320
those people ran out because the

615
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,440
survival rate is not that great

616
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,320
so by now what they're doing is they're

617
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,039
buying

618
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,080
old construction plane plans for old

619
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,679
submarines

620
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,440
and try to rebuild them i'm skeptical of

621
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,840
the approach

622
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,200
the most common method for sea smuggling

623
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,679
is go fast boats

624
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,320
it's basically a boat that is relatively

625
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,799
light

626
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,159
and has far too big motors is really

627
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,679
fast

628
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,720
and you go from a to b so fast that

629
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,080
the border patrol cannot react

630
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,520
and i have pictures for that because

631
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,880
it's really advanced by now

632
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
and drags in parasites that basically

633
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,240
means you have a big ship

634
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,000
you attach your goods from the outside

635
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
to the ship

636
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,080
let the ship go and then you take it

637
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
over again it sounds interesting i have

638
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,600
pictures

639
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,960
that's a drop off so what you see here

640
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,200
is

641
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,279
not the smugglers that is actually

642
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,440
border guard that's why there's a

643
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,670
picture of it

644
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,720
[Music]

645
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,000
that is cocaine it's basically

646
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,480
in uh all these pieces are connected so

647
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,960
they don't drift apart

648
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
and then do you see this little white

649
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,159
device here

650
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,480
that's the homing beacon so basically

651
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,240
what happened is you had this big

652
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,240
international fighter somebody there

653
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,279
threw the ship into the water

654
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,159
and then the next day or whatever a

655
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,760
local fisherman would have

656
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,159
gone out there use the homing beacon to

657
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:22,799
find it

658
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,279
pull it in go back to the harbor

659
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,039
smuggling done

660
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,840
not in this case

661
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,520
semi-submersibles i'm not sure if you

662
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,000
can really see that because it's

663
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,200
in camouflage so you have this

664
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,880
little boat up here and that boat in the

665
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,200
water would look similar to this one so

666
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,520
it's just below the water line

667
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,960
which means that it doesn't have a

668
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
silhouette which means that you cannot

669
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,480
see it from another boat

670
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,840
you can only see it from the air and

671
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,200
these are like every big cartel is yeah

672
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,039
investing in that so they're

673
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,799
actually driving them

674
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,679
do you drive them is that the right word

675
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,760
yeah okay so you drive

676
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,840
from um from colombia

677
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,200
up to um washington state so they go

678
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,320
like i don't know

679
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,000
3 000 kilometers with those things

680
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,720
imagine that

681
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,559
not a job i won't have

682
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,840
those are go fast boats so

683
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,720
one of my favorites is actually this one

684
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,600
because it's transporting a car

685
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,440
that's a shiny smuggler because they're

686
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,000
very high import tariffs for cars in

687
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,279
china

688
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,559
for foreign cars so it

689
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,520
really makes sense to smuggle cars so

690
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
this is a go fast boat you can see like

691
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,960
five big engines

692
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,480
in the back one dude driving one car is

693
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,440
the good

694
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,279
and it looks as if there's in the

695
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,480
car

696
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,880
you know i mean optimization and those

697
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,320
boats are really fast so they're like 80

698
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,720
and more kilometers an hour fast on the

699
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
sea

700
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,320
a great way to kill yourself by the way

701
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,200
and this is a gofus boat that went from

702
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,000
morocco

703
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,480
to spain so this is a mixture of hashish

704
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,720
and cocaine actually because it's one of

705
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,279
the big cocaine routes

706
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,039
and what you have here is that's a radar

707
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,480
because they're basically looking for

708
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,200
other boats which is important because

709
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,320
um between morocco

710
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,159
and spain you have the strait of

711
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,840
gilberta and it's a big parking lot for

712
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,000
ships and when you're at that speed you

713
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,559
can't

714
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,640
at night you really don't want to run

715
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,200
into an oil tanker

716
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,240
so they have radar so they can plan

717
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,760
their routes

718
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,279
and um they those go fast boats are

719
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,440
often one-time use

720
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,559
so they're used from going from a to b

721
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,039
they're crashed onto the beach then you

722
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,799
have like four or five people on the

723
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,080
boat

724
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
they are for intercept so if the police

725
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,919
catches them on the water they're just

726
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,200
there to throw the into the water

727
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,760
and then when they reach the beach with

728
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,039
the goods you have like

729
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,159
50 people coming out of the woods

730
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,200
grab the stuff and disappear again so

731
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,640
that is how go fast

732
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,320
smuggling works and it's really

733
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
efficient and it's the

734
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,960
um today is the most efficient and

735
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,559
secure way of smuggling

736
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,399
that's 150 000 about

737
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,000
yeah that's disposable i mean uh this

738
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,880
year

739
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,320
is probably something like 5 million

740
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,080
worth of goods

741
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,199
cost of business you know

742
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,279
it's a stamped basically

743
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,000
but as you know the irish are cheap

744
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,399
so what the irish do is they have this

745
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,200
boat sitting

746
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,640
in the harbor for multiple use

747
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,520
so as a customs officer you're going

748
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,200
through the harbor and you count one

749
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,640
two three four five six seven eight

750
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,120
eight motors for a fisherman

751
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,520
sounds plausible to me

752
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,640
or you're chinese in chinese means

753
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,880
you're not making any jokes so what you

754
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,720
build is

755
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,559
this thing my thing doesn't work anymore

756
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,919
this is a stealth armored

757
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,039
go fast boat it's not a joke

758
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,440
this thing has a very low profile it has

759
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,679
those

760
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,799
angled sides it is actually painted with

761
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,720
graphite

762
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,840
it's i can't remember something like 60

763
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
kilometers an hour fast

764
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,799
and it's armored because the main method

765
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,600
of taking

766
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,640
down gofar's boats is to shoot at them

767
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,880
to shoot at the motors so you have a

768
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,480
helicopter

769
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,840
goes over the boat and then you have a

770
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,000
50 cal

771
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,519
and that is how you switch off of go

772
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,720
fast boat with that thing

773
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,840
no way it's armored and this is for

774
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,880
transporting

775
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,360
cars again you know it's basically a car

776
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,120
ferry illegal

777
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,159
and four cars fit into that

778
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,880
and it was actually captured in the

779
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,519
harbor

780
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,360
because outside there could never get it

781
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,360
okay drags and parasites

782
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,720
uh on the top left you see a colombian

783
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,919
i think a colombian policeman

784
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,760
and in the background you have one of

785
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,679
those semi-submersibles but in the

786
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,240
foreground the big blue thing

787
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,640
you would put your goods into that then

788
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,320
you have a couple of divers

789
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,760
you go under one of those big ships

790
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,799
and attach it from the bottom and then

791
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,679
they carry it

792
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,000
over the atlantic for you and then in

793
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
the destination harbor you would have

794
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,320
divers

795
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,720
disconnecting it and that's how you do

796
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,600
it

797
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,639
that's the mexicans

798
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,120
right side is spanish people

799
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,000
you know different design but but it's

800
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,519
basically doing the same thing

801
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,480
and both got caught the colombians got

802
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
caught before they used it

803
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,360
the spanish after they used it

804
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,760
colombians no loss of goods spanish

805
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,360
nice bricks in the background there

806
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,279
market opportunity so

807
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,320
now everybody says of course hey

808
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,600
in reality why should we care about this

809
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,519
big time smuggling

810
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,240
we have the postal system you know we

811
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,559
all

812
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,840
heard about darknet markets and

813
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,799
how secure and safe and awesome they are

814
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,440
and

815
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,279
you just order it to your home and get

816
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,039
high

817
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,200
let's talk about postal system so number

818
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,559
one

819
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,720
the postal system has public routing

820
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,679
which means that

821
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,519
you need to have an address where you

822
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,880
receive it

823
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,480
and most people are not very good at

824
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,039
having a second mailbox you know most

825
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,880
people on darkroot markets actually

826
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,559
order to their home

827
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,559
and then they're scared when the darknet

828
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,840
market gets busted

829
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,960
you know then the second thing is

830
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,480
that the modern postal system

831
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,399
like when you look past the little

832
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,799
yellow or red

833
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,159
post boxes is actually a machine and

834
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,760
it's a high tech machine

835
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,480
so one of the things is fingerprinting

836
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,000
and parcel id

837
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,080
this is what the right side is for i'm

838
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,480
going to read it and then translate it

839
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,039
our fingerprint technology makes use of

840
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,279
the fact that no two male pieces or

841
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,240
parcels look

842
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,839
exactly alike optical characteristics

843
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,879
such as surfaces

844
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,119
stamps and logos are recorded along with

845
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,800
the male pieces size

846
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,199
volume and weight now the interesting

847
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,399
part

848
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,000
the image based identification

849
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,480
technology thus recognizes a male piece

850
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,800
or parcel throughout the entire process

851
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,239
chain the image can be used for in-hub

852
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,199
that is like in the sorting facility and

853
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,639
cross-border

854
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,679
you know breaking the law as well as

855
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,480
third-party read intelligence agencies

856
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,639
parcel tracking

857
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,359
this is from the official sales document

858
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,320
of

859
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,440
a siemens parser's sorting machine so

860
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,480
what they actually do

861
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,639
is they're two ways so number one is

862
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,119
toshiba uses a little printer so you can

863
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:55,760
always see

864
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,680
who sorted your stuff you know so

865
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
in a toshiba machine you have a little

866
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,200
uv ink

867
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,280
barcode printed on it because they print

868
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,800
this barcode on it

869
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,280
as soon as the parcel or letter enters

870
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,960
the system

871
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,280
and then they track that barcode from a

872
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,800
to b

873
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,640
if you're a siemens machine victim

874
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,680
you don't see anything because they keep

875
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,880
this database of

876
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,119
every single mail piece processed by

877
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,440
their systems

878
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,160
what does that allow you for example if

879
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,000
you're randomly finding

880
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,200
a darknet letter you know like a drug

881
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,560
shipment what you do is you

882
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,520
go to the database and say give me every

883
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,240
piece that looks similar

884
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,960
so using the same kind of stamps same

885
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,160
stamp position

886
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,079
um same paper same weight whatever

887
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,560
and then you get these pieces you know

888
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,680
shown

889
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,520
but in addition to those pieces you

890
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,960
actually know on which

891
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,240
sorting curve it entered the sorting

892
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,800
curve

893
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,240
is determining which

894
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,119
post box that piece was picked up from

895
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,160
and you know the position in the sorting

896
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,640
key

897
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,800
which means you have a rough estimate of

898
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,920
the time

899
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,119
when it was pushed into the post box so

900
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,359
what this allows you to do

901
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,920
is to actually figure out all the

902
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,800
shipments from

903
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,040
a certain darknet dealer in a relatively

904
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
easy way

905
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,599
and then you map them on a heat map so

906
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,200
basically you have a map

907
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,240
of the environment and then you say okay

908
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,800
this post box had so many of this last

909
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,160
week

910
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,640
this one i had so many of this other way

911
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,760
so you have this heat map

912
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,000
and when then you can analyze that heat

913
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,800
map

914
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,720
and actually make predictions about the

915
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,560
next mailbox being used or even the

916
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,520
location of

917
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,960
where the shipper actually uh operates

918
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,359
from so his office basically

919
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,720
and that's that's a technique that has

920
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,920
been used against

921
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,960
a serial criminals for

922
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,920
over 50 years heat mapping is extremely

923
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,520
efficient

924
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,640
and randomizing a heat map is extremely

925
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,760
costly because

926
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
you know cost plays a role and people

927
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,839
are lazy

928
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,040
darknet dealers are unable to do that so

929
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,119
they get away with luck not because the

930
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,280
postal system is interesting

931
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
so what you do as soon as you kind of

932
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,200
know what letter boxes will be used in

933
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,720
the future

934
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,560
you set up surveillance many things

935
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,000
we'll talk about them a little bit later

936
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,599
i think

937
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,320
plus you go through the list of all

938
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,720
people having priors in the same

939
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,560
area for a similar offense

940
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,800
and that basically means the only reason

941
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,160
why um

942
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,599
a lot of darknet dealers are not caught

943
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,200
is because the police is actually

944
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,040
overwhelmed it's not because the method

945
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,560
is secure

946
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,320
it's because the police has other

947
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,000
to do

948
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,440
that's it postal system not very secure

949
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,640
it's um what's the motto of this year

950
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,680
digital totality that is digital

951
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,240
totality

952
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,040
what other risks do exist now you have

953
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,720
this um

954
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,920
x-ray and backscatter systems uh that

955
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,119
you know from the airport

956
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,359
for uh you know naked scanners basically

957
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,880
you know you walk through them

958
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,720
then there's this little picture of a

959
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,560
stick figure

960
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,240
that is what they see basically

961
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
essentially

962
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,079
x-rays look for density

963
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,400
so they're able to differentiate for

964
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,280
example

965
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,680
between dense and less dense materials

966
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,800
or metallic

967
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,480
not metallic materials and backscatter

968
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,560
can be actually used to

969
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,200
get a sense of the material in the sense

970
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,800
is it

971
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,079
organic or inorganic for example and

972
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,520
they do that with whole trucks and

973
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,599
containers and whatever and then

974
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,760
in the middle or the second from the

975
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,960
bottom

976
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,880
what you see there is that somebody

977
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,599
tried to stash a different good

978
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,760
and they got caught because they forgot

979
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,680
that you have to stash it on all sides

980
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,079
if you want to hide it

981
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,560
then of course you have dogs dogs are

982
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,000
not just used against

983
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,839
drugs but against money and electronics

984
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839
and

985
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,760
so um the

986
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,200
x-ray machines and back scattering

987
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,079
machines don't give you a

988
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,480
three-dimensional image

989
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,920
but they basically give you something

990
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,079
like a surface area

991
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,560
you know so it's a basically a shadow

992
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,000
that you're seeing

993
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,359
and what these people here did like the

994
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,119
one two and three is from one um car

995
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,079
it's a mirrored actually and what you

996
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,760
can see on the bottom

997
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,200
one all the goods look

998
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,720
similar but on the top one

999
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,440
you can see here that the pattern of the

1000
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,880
goods is a different one

1001
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,680
it doesn't look similar to these ones

1002
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,280
and that means there are different goods

1003
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,839
in there

1004
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,079
so but if you stash it on all sides with

1005
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:16,880
the same

1006
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,359
concealment good it kind of looks the

1007
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,960
same

1008
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,160
and they didn't do that i heard

1009
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,079
okay dogs dogs are not just used against

1010
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:30,880
drugs

1011
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,440
their use against money they're used

1012
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,640
against electronics

1013
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,480
and cobit and

1014
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,839
stuff dogs are highly efficient

1015
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,880
they're basically the best tool for

1016
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,000
breaking into ant smuggling networks

1017
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,440
so they dock at the in the bowls of the

1018
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,000
airport

1019
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,280
looking about sniffing at all the bags

1020
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,119
is probably one of the most efficient

1021
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,319
tools

1022
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,880
because dogs don't think they're just

1023
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,760
happy to

1024
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,960
play and they don't get tired

1025
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,119
that is i mean they get tired but they

1026
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,079
don't get bored

1027
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,599
and they smell cocaine

1028
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,839
so then you have this whole

1029
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,720
issue of tracking today everything is

1030
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,440
tracked

1031
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,040
you know tracking is a big thing so ais

1032
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,079
is the tracking method for boats so

1033
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,960
the regulations for how many how big

1034
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
your boat may be

1035
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,640
before you need a tracker it's going

1036
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
down all the time so

1037
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,560
canoes will have trackers sooner or

1038
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,400
later

1039
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,720
adbs adsb is

1040
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,040
active flight radar so it's basically a

1041
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,800
little box that

1042
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,720
sends out the position and number of the

1043
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,040
plane and stuff like that

1044
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,119
and this stuff can be received and it's

1045
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,040
received not just by

1046
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
traffic control but it's also received

1047
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,279
by

1048
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,000
police and private security companies

1049
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,680
and so on and so on and then you can

1050
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,839
throw a little bit a ai and ml on it

1051
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,200
to classify the behavior of vessels

1052
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,880
and say this is likely a smuggling

1053
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,240
vessel or this is a

1054
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,599
a fisher man so

1055
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,040
then pick up surveillance and trackers

1056
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,200
the police often knows who is sending

1057
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,400
stuff

1058
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,319
but it's still legal especially when it

1059
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,720
comes to money

1060
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,119
until it crosses the border so what

1061
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,280
often happens is that the police takes

1062
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,520
out a potential smuggler

1063
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,160
puts trackers under the cars and just

1064
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,800
waits for the cars to cross the border

1065
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,440
and that is how they got these um

1066
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,880
1.5 million euros from netherlands to

1067
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,359
to germany two weeks ago that is like a

1068
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,000
standard

1069
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,520
method then body language body language

1070
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,640
is this thing

1071
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,280
um you might be able to conceal your

1072
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,160
stuff

1073
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,680
but concealing your emotions is

1074
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,359
something different

1075
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,560
and if you risk a few years in prison

1076
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,560
or losing half a million in coke then

1077
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,280
you're stressed and stuff like that so a

1078
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,800
lot of smugglers actually

1079
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,040
make sure that the people that carry

1080
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,400
their stuff

1081
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,520
don't actually know that they're

1082
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,760
carrying so it's one of the risky things

1083
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,119
in certain countries don't give your

1084
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,079
luggage to the hotel for storage

1085
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,079
because there are a lot of gangs that

1086
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,079
are specialized

1087
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,240
in opening your luggage like the empty

1088
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,359
luggage

1089
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,920
put in there put a tracker in there

1090
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,440
and then when you go back to

1091
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,000
czech republic germany whatever you have

1092
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,920
those nice people in a car following you

1093
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,359
home

1094
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,640
to retrieve their goods so and

1095
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,400
they do that to beat body language

1096
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,480
basically

1097
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,640
route heat and computers

1098
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,319
certain goods come from certain places

1099
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,480
and the consumers are different places

1100
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,000
and there are only a limited number of

1101
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
routes between them

1102
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,040
so what police does is

1103
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,359
every time they find something they put

1104
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,599
that into a database

1105
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,359
and this database with all the

1106
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,839
information when did they find what

1107
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,640
from on that vessel and so on and so on

1108
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,040
is constantly analyzed

1109
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,280
and out of that the police and

1110
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,680
intelligence agencies actually

1111
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,960
learn which routes are used by smugglers

1112
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,200
and that is something that gets better

1113
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,119
and better so the

1114
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,000
time between the establishing of the of

1115
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,599
a new route

1116
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,000
and police actually shutting it down by

1117
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,240
controlling every single shipment

1118
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,119
is getting shorter and shorter and the

1119
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,119
other big thing they really like

1120
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,880
is infiltrating organizations because

1121
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,640
when it comes to wholesale drug

1122
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,920
shipments for example

1123
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,040
almost all of them are either completely

1124
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,640
random fines

1125
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,839
or um leaks

1126
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,240
like somebody gets infiltrated into an

1127
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
organization leaks the information

1128
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,520
or somebody gets into infiltrated

1129
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,760
in another organization that knows about

1130
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,520
that shipment of a competitor and then

1131
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,880
it gets leaked

1132
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,280
so that is actually how most of the big

1133
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,680
shipments are are found it's by leaking

1134
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,640
or infiltration and then digital

1135
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,079
intercept

1136
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,240
if you know the news you have those

1137
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,359
secure phones for criminals

1138
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,720
anchor chat phantom secure etc you break

1139
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,359
into them

1140
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,119
you learn everything about smoking that

1141
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,640
you as a police officer

1142
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,760
in training want to know

1143
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,240
so what about the future what what time

1144
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,799
is it actually

1145
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,599
oh do you have time any other

1146
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,880
okay sorry i'm really sorry

1147
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,160
um last mile

1148
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,240
so we know the postal system is kind of

1149
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,920
risky because of

1150
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,200
the receiver identifiability etc

1151
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,160
so one of the things that is done um

1152
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,440
when there's a lot of surveillance

1153
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,040
pressure or the postal system doesn't

1154
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,400
work

1155
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,440
is using drop ganks so drop gangs is

1156
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,400
this

1157
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,680
instead of shipping a letter you hide

1158
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,440
the goods in a certain location and then

1159
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,480
give the

1160
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,079
customer the location to pick it up

1161
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,119
this is relatively big in russia the

1162
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,920
balkans parts of asia

1163
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,079
it's coming into the west right now a

1164
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,280
little bit

1165
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,400
and it's actually in in those countries

1166
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,000
where it is established

1167
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,280
it almost completely replaced the

1168
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,680
postal based dark net markets

1169
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,640
then when you look at berlin for example

1170
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,400
or london or whatever

1171
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,680
roving drops is the method so it's uh

1172
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,200
aka cocaine taxi you know you call a

1173
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,400
number you say

1174
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,599
i want the stuff and then you have this

1175
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,800
this car coming either directly to you

1176
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,760
or coming close by establishing a debt

1177
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,319
drop

1178
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,560
that only holds for a few minutes the

1179
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,240
car leaves they call you again and say

1180
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,160
it's under the bench

1181
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,000
that is really hard to battle actually

1182
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,760
especially if you're using

1183
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,680
car sharing etc to distribute the goods

1184
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,559
then one thing drone drops that sounds

1185
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,440
funny

1186
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,720
it's actually something that that is

1187
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,800
happening a lot in latin america and

1188
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,960
asia that is basically they have this

1189
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,400
mavic air

1190
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,520
i forgot the name so not the smallest

1191
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,640
mavic drone but

1192
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,599
one two one bigger there they actually

1193
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,000
have

1194
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,520
um an accessor that you can buy

1195
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,559
to drop goods it's actually on amazon

1196
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,160
and it's good enough for a few ounces of

1197
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,599
product so what you can do is

1198
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,880
you fly over the customer you press

1199
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,359
a button on your remote and it drops the

1200
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,240
goods

1201
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,400
it protects you as a merchant

1202
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,680
okay so what this all moves to

1203
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,079
is that there's a separation in the

1204
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,440
ordering process the ordering today

1205
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,319
is basically all cryptocurrencies plus

1206
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,280
social media and instant messenger

1207
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,359
instagram is really important for drug

1208
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,559
dealing uh

1209
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,040
telegram super important twitter

1210
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,760
is like when it comes to french drug

1211
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,880
dealers

1212
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,559
twitter is very fine at all

1213
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,800
and then you have drops for the last

1214
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,040
mile so why do you do that you have

1215
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,000
lower infiltration

1216
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,960
risk so it's much harder to get a dealer

1217
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,760
and then jump

1218
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,359
up in the command chain

1219
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,880
tracking is much harder than in the

1220
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,720
postal system

1221
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,880
so there's no record that you can access

1222
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,640
you leak less intelligence but there is

1223
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,480
this issue of new surveillance laws

1224
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,000
coming so

1225
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,240
one of the big things for why they want

1226
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,839
into messengers

1227
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,160
is actually to to beat the the black

1228
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,680
market

1229
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,720
so a lot of these anti-crypto laws and

1230
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,240
fingerprinting for media files

1231
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,920
is actually about this you know they all

1232
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,440
say it's about child porn

1233
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,800
but it's actually easier to detect

1234
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,280
mariana on a picture than child porn

1235
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,480
with ai

1236
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,000
and that is kind of what is coming there

1237
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,480
and then you have this whole issue that

1238
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,559
the police is learning as well

1239
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,200
so you have a lot of anti-drone laws

1240
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,839
coming

1241
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,640
so bigger laws drones that are usable

1242
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,480
become illegal

1243
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,319
and you have stuff like automatic

1244
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,000
license plate recognition

1245
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,920
to detect growing um roving dealers you

1246
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,599
know so you put a few of those

1247
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,040
recognition systems

1248
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,680
at the street corners then you ordered

1249
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,480
your drugs

1250
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,240
and you do that 20 times and sooner or

1251
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,599
later you know the car that is

1252
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,200
delivering it

1253
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,599
and all of these methods require smart

1254
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:12,559
dealers

1255
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,160
and they're not that many smart dealers

1256
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,480
out there

1257
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,400
but the few smart dealers that exist

1258
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,319
they're you know upgrading their as

1259
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,119
well so what do you do as a

1260
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:30,559
advanced cypherpunk dealer these days

1261
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,880
remember this is a performance art i'm

1262
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,680
not making any suggestions

1263
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,359
so number one is most drug deals

1264
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,160
especially when it comes to bigger stuff

1265
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,720
the

1266
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,480
receivers and the senders want to

1267
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,559
establish control over the environment

1268
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,559
and they do that by spotters spotters

1269
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,000
are people

1270
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
they're sitting in the cafe only with a

1271
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,520
cell phone for all day

1272
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,880
you know they're just watching the

1273
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,119
street or they're sitting on a

1274
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,839
on a rooftop

1275
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,480
or they're driving around with their

1276
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,400
little motorbike all day

1277
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,440
so if you're in a border town and you

1278
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,000
see those

1279
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,599
people that really have nothing else to

1280
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,359
do then watch

1281
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,559
those are spotters and they basically as

1282
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,400
soon as they see strangers or the police

1283
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,040
or whatever

1284
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,880
they call up the chain and say hey

1285
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,079
here's police

1286
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,200
and that is how they control the

1287
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,119
environment now

1288
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,079
spotters are upgrading so in the past

1289
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,240
spotters would whistle or shout

1290
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,720
then they got cell phones then they got

1291
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,920
instant messaging

1292
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,400
and today they have night vision systems

1293
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,359
as well

1294
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,839
so you have those people controlling the

1295
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,839
pot area

1296
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,160
then all those tracking systems for

1297
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,839
ships and

1298
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,839
planes and whatever can of course be

1299
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,760
used by the smugglers as well

1300
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,240
so what you have today is you have this

1301
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:50,880
nerd

1302
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,400
sitting in the corner with an sdr

1303
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,680
and checking where all the police

1304
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,760
helicopters are and checking where all

1305
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,720
the coast guard

1306
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,240
boats are then

1307
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,440
if you really asking for trouble

1308
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,160
you want to identify all the motor

1309
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,800
vehicles

1310
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,559
of the police and automatic license

1311
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,920
plate recognition is something that you

1312
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,839
can do yourself because you can download

1313
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,680
the software from github

1314
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,640
so what people do is they have those

1315
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,000
little

1316
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,880
raspberry pi's with a camera alpr

1317
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,480
software on it

1318
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,040
and they put that on trees or something

1319
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,520
else

1320
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,480
around police stations if you do that

1321
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,160
long enough

1322
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,200
you know which license plates are police

1323
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,400
undercover or not and then

1324
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,880
you put license plate recognition around

1325
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,079
your hot zones again like your

1326
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,760
headquarter or whatever

1327
00:52:45,760 --> 00:53:01,839
whenever you see a certain frequencies

1328
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,000
you
