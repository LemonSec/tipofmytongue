9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,399
most interesting person i have ever met

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,760
and maybe i should start with the thing

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,239
that

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,840
alexander started his career as a

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,440
as a musician he created six pans

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,280
if i'm it's it's correct there's six

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,800
pounds

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,760

everybody knows hits from army of lovers

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,199
here in slovakia or the czech republic

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,440
because

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
these songs were hit in the beginning of

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,879
90s

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,159
in these socialistic countries

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240
and after this career

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,759
he started to be philosopher

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,720
and he wrote during the period of 20 20

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,600
years

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,200
he wrote five books

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,840
the first book if i'm correct was

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,479
netocracy

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,320
anetocracy was is the book about the

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,920
explosion of the

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
of the internet and um he

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,720
coined com some some new terms and one

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,759
of the new term was

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,960
netocrats which is a new

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,399
internet aristocracy the people

39
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,240
behind internet corporation internet

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,680
giants these people

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,200
are according to alexander the the

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,240
nettocrats and also he he defined

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,360
a new term which is called a quite new

44
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,719
term which is called

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,320
uh consummatory art

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
so this conceptoria are all people who

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,000
are just consumers

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,360
in this new digital aristocratic system

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,480
after this book he published

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,879
some other books but one of very

51
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,959
interesting book book is

52
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,680
book about synthesism because alexander

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,560
also

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,480
created a new chart or new religion

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,239
in in sweden it's called synthastic

56
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,319
synthastic church and

57
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,200
sintastic church basically this religion

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
is focused on

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,920
atheists and panties people who are

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
looking for

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,560
some kind of internal spirituality

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,879
i i found i followed the information

63
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,040
that the the biggest

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,080
biggest event for uh like

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
this synthetic simplistic uh movement is

66
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
birdman festival

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,280
because alexander is also very

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
influential

69
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,959
and very active in organizing uh burning

70
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,560
man festival

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,200
also in organizing his local local

72
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,560
burning man version

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
which is called borderland if i remember

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,560
correctly

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
and his recent book is called

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,319
digital libido so sex power and violence

77
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,159
in the network society

78
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,080
and i was especially

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,440
impressed that he

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,519
he decided to to classified people to

81
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,120
two categories

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
uh the first category are heric people

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
people who are able to cope with their

84
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,599
past

85
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,280
with everything they would happen

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,319
in in their past and

87
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,760
they try to do the best according to

88
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,319
their

89
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,439
moral values and then

90
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,799
you have people of victimhood

91
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,159
victimhood culture and maybe

92
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,480
alexander is the right person who will

93
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,840
tell you more about

94
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,560
about this recent book okay so welcome

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,080
alexander here

96
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,590
i'm really happy thank you

97
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,680
[Applause]

98
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
can you hear me it's on yeah okay

99
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,759
um actually i'm not i'm not going to be

100
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,520
very low-tech i'm just going to use a

101
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,000
little

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,080
you know a few sheets of paper and just

103
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,199
draw something because i'm actually

104
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
going to try it a new idea with you guys

105
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
you deserve it right so i'm a

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
philosopher a philosopher is

107
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,360
not a scientist a scientist is a person

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
who tries to solve problems

109
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
and then hopefully his mother is going

110
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
to like him for it and maybe his

111
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,199
girlfriend even you know that's a

112
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,160
scientist right

113
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,919
a philosopher is somebody who invents

114
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,320
problems so i like to make the world

115
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,280
worse for you

116
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
more complicated um and that's what

117
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
philosophers do and i'm going to launch

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,720
a concept of working on

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,479
we're working actually on a trilogy on

120
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,479
santa claus tonight the center some book

121
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,919
creating god in the into the dates and

122
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,000
by the way that's a better take than

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
ray kurzweil's awful singularity theory

124
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
it needed to be worked on and done

125
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,320
properly

126
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,680
and then did it to libido which is a

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,199
very dark book because it's going to be

128
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,960
a very dark period now the next

129
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,400
50 years often called the dark

130
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
renaissance we're heading to now

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,080
that's a really dark book that's typical

132
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,479
for a trilogy right first say that

133
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,680
there's something amazing is going to

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,039
happen sometime in the future we're

135
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,000
heading towards that

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
and then you warn everybody it says

137
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
because you don't understand it

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
it's going to be real up first

139
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
right so

140
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,320
we're working on the third part of this

141
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
trilogy is going to take us another two

142
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,680
three years or something before john and

143
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
i are finished but

144
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,960
i'm gonna work on a concept with you

145
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,479
guys today that i think you can find

146
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,039
interesting

147
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,039
and the concept is called paradigmatics

148
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
so paradigmatic ironically this we need

149
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
a new term for that

150
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,120
paradigmatic is that assume that you

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,240
live in a specific historical period

152
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
so you arrive in some kind of a context

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,800
these are the conditions you live with

154
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,199
you're told certain rules and laws and

155
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,880
things that you need to abide to

156
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,360
and very often these laws or rules that

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,199
you need to buy to are old

158
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,520
and ladies and hate the future and they

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,280
just basically want to conserve you not

160
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,560
do anything smart

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
okay that's usually what happens in

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
history so you arrive in a paradigm and

163
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,919
you discover that the paradigm around

164
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,440
you actually is radically

165
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
new compared to what everybody believes

166
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,880
around you

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,039
so you want a pragmatic approach to that

168
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:23,919
paradigm

169
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,000
you want to know how you become a winner

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,680
how do you master the new paradigm how

171
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,520
do you become smarter than anybody else

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
and this is what we call paradigmatics

173
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,280
and here's the problem you guys here

174
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,639
are one of the three in the talk or

175
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,919
system you write about in our books i've

176
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,440
written about for the past 20 years

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,520
one of the three photographers one we

178
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,880
call the protopians

179
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,280
uh you're not of course internet giants

180
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,720
tech giants and that kind of the

181
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,319
guys who collect the data as the first

182
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,280
mentocracy

183
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,599
the second metocracy of the sun soccer

184
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,880
is easy it's going to replace

185
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
politicians and things like that

186
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
why would you vote every four years will

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,599
actually vote every second

188
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,199
of course the chinese take on that is

189
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,880
dictatorship and the dictator

190
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
and all the data in the entire nation

191
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,080
goes into a central

192
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
computer in control of the dictator it's

193
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,919
a very old egyptian idea actually it's

194
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,199
not very chinese

195
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,360
um but you know we're probably fighting

196
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
against that i think we all agree on

197
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
that we support the guys in hong kong at

198
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
the moment whatever they can do to

199
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,400
it up

200
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,160
that's fine so you belong to another

201
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,319
plutocracy which is the protopians

202
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,560
and fortunately your best or most

203
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
popular brothers and sisters in the

204
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,400
world today are called taiwanese hackers

205
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,520
the coolest thing you can be on the

206
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
planet right now is to be taiwanese

207
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,639
hacker who's trying to get around the

208
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,520
three million

209
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
sensors are employed by the chinese

210
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,000
government to control communist china

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,319
and luckily there are 80 million chinese

212
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,759
people in exile and they're probably the

213
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,720
most innovative

214
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
wealthiest people on the planet right

215
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,080
now and they're the ones you ally with

216
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,039
so paradigmatic series like what kind of

217
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,479
paradigm do we live in

218
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,319
well the problem is that you're gonna

219
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,360
have a lot of old power structures

220
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
redundant old power structures where you

221
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,400
do paradigm

222
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,960
shift which is what's currently going on

223
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,000
you can then either be

224
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,560
mediocre at the paradigm paramedics

225
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
which means you're just going to beat

226
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,919
the old power system and improve

227
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,400
on what you do compared to them you can

228
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,199
also go really deep into history

229
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,319
deep into what it means to be human in

230
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,639
historical sense deep what it means to

231
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
have technology around you

232
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,919
and you can actually use the entire

233
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,840
system the own paradigm to become a

234
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,800
master of it

235
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
much better than anybody else because

236
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,160
you're not just good enough to be

237
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,120
mediocre

238
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,840
you're better than facebook we're all

239
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,440
going to leave facebook in 10 years time

240
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
we're all going to keep bitcoin forever

241
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,719
but that's just because it's god's

242
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,000
currency

243
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,599
it's a currency that no human being can

244
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,279
kill it's just like the internet

245
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,880
that's what the internet is a god too

246
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
because you can't stop the internet you

247
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,679
can blow up the entire planet with

248
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,120
atomic bombs doesn't matter the internet

249
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
will still be around

250
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
because it is a completely decentralized

251
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,560
system that can very soon put its own

252
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,160
energy into the system and by that time

253
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,600
the internet lives on its own and it's a

254
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,240
god

255
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,760
same thing with bitcoin so bitcoin is

256
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
god's currency you know

257
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,880
you don't have to be offended if i don't

258
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,160
talk more about bitcoin because you do

259
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,440
that the entire weekend anyway

260
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
i'm actually going to move you over to

261
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
another part of paradigmatics

262
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,720
so that is what is this paradigm what is

263
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,040
it

264
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,640
really really really about because i

265
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,839
think the war over

266
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,880
currency is very marginal

267
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,160
why because money in itself as a

268
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,399
communication of value was invented

269
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
during the old paradigm

270
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,519
so if you're obsessed with money and

271
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,360
currency you're probably too obsessed

272
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,720
with the old power down to actually get

273
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,959
what a new paradigm is all about

274
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,640
and instead what i want to talk about

275
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,720
today is that the real war between the

276
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,760
old power structure

277
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,519
and the new power structure that we're

278
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,800
going to see over the next 50 years is

279
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
the war over the algorithms

280
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,240
because the algorithms that was

281
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,399
generally historically new and whoever

282
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,839
controls the algorithms is going to have

283
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,000
the ultimate power

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,839
the rest is just communication tools

285
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,360
that's what currencies are

286
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,000
so what does this mean it means that

287
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,640
we're coming out of a paradigm we've had

288
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,600
three major human paradigms in the past

289
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
we happen to speak

290
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,079
apes don't speak so the first paradigm

291
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,839
is just spoken language that paradigm

292
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,000
lasted for at least 200 000 years

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,760
and with homo sapiens we spoke to each

294
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,120
other for 200 000 years

295
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
and anything we needed we had to

296
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,760
memorize because the only storage space

297
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,120
for information we had was

298
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040
our own brain and that's probably why

299
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
power in a tribe was held by an old

300
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,519
woman

301
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,120
because she had memorized more stuff

302
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,040
than you had so if you were 20 years old

303
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,399
the old woman would just come up to you

304
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,519
when you were a cocky during your

305
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,519
writing past and say i'm 20 years old

306
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,720
look at my big dick and i'm going to

307
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,160
take over the world and an old woman

308
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,680
would just walk up to the troubles

309
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
smack you in the face say you're nothing

310
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,800
without me you know

311
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,839
nothing and that's essentially how a

312
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,360
tribe still works if you go to the

313
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,440
amazonian jungle or go to new guinea i

314
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,880
do i'm an anthropologist

315
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,360
so and i still think it's a great idea

316
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,720
by the way that old women smack young

317
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
men in the face they should more often

318
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,600
right

319
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,800
and they should be paid for it and then

320
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
they're called therapists okay so anyway

321
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,920
uh

322
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,519
the paradigmatics we're involved with

323
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,680
here is to understand the third paradigm

324
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,120
that comes out of that the first one is

325
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,000
spoken language

326
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
the second one is written language

327
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,160
starts about 8 000 years ago

328
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,680
with written language you can actually

329
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,279
create permanent settlements

330
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,040
so one of the most radical moves in

331
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
human history was

332
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,519
some fat old sat down in babylon 8

333
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,000
000 years

334
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
ago and said i'm not going to move any

335
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
longer i'm not going to be nomadic

336
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,920
i'm going to have a permanent settlement

337
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,480
and you guys need to deliver to me

338
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,279
the first towns in history were graded

339
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,120
because of what because we could start

340
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,680
to store

341
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,320
information outside of our own brains if

342
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,120
you write down

343
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,399
information it's outside of your brain

344
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,560
so it's a very simple logic it just

345
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,839
means that if you write everything down

346
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,440
so you get the old woman she's about to

347
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,959
die you sit with her in your nursery

348
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,640
room she's got coffee at 19. she's about

349
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,560
to die you ask her about her entire life

350
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
you write everything down

351
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,720
she dies oh the woman is dead or

352
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
matriarch is dead he said don't worry

353
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
i kept all the information i wrote it

354
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
down so we don't have to make the

355
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,639
mistakes she made during her life

356
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,000
we can build on her previous experience

357
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,040
this is called evantology and it's the

358
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
only new idea we human beings ever come

359
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
up with besides being nomadic

360
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,880
because in nomadic society everything

361
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,399
was a return to the same

362
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,040
all the time it's called hinduism today

363
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,720
douglas rushkoff still wants to go back

364
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,360
to it

365
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,279
it's just like everything returns to the

366
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,839
same the only new idea anybody ever came

367
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,240
up with was the raster's idea three

368
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,639
thousand

369
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,639
seven hundred years ago in persia then

370
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,680
wait a second

371
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
if we store information outside of our

372
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,880
own brain

373
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,720
including writing contracts which is

374
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,959
wonderful so you can legally own

375
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,760
territory

376
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
okay so if you store information outside

377
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,680
of your own brain that means

378
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,519
what we call the psychonauts the son

379
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,720
starts dreaming about

380
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,399
creating a better world than his father

381
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,399
could have done

382
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,839
that idea is impossible without written

383
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
language and it's the only new radical

384
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,519
idea we ever did

385
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,519
so after spoken

386
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,200
and written suddenly somebody in germany

387
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
in 1450

388
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,760
invented the printing press and that's

389
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,480
mass media

390
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,320
so take a book 1449 how would you make a

391
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,000
book in 1449

392
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,880
here in bohemia czech republic you would

393
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,560
have to handwrite it

394
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,760
how long would it take to hand write a

395
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
book three years on average

396
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,399
okay how much would it cost i'm a bit

397
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,760
vulgar you're not saying bitcoins i'm

398
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,880
saying 160

399
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,760
000 euros per book so 160 000 euros per

400
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,079
book

401
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,839
three years of work not many books

402
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,600
around and they're probably all bibles

403
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,760
and qurans and that's about it

404
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
okay if you had four books you were cool

405
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,000
you had a vip lounge you got laid

406
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,279
you must have been incredibly wealthy to

407
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,000
have four books 40 50 the printing press

408
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,720
comes along

409
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,959
a lot of monks and nuns around europe

410
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,560
start protesting

411
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,240
they demonstrate and said stop the

412
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
printing press it's killing our

413
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,120
jobs okay that's been all of history

414
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,720
every time there's a paradigm shift

415
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,079
there are a lot of people invested in

416
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,000
the previous paradigm who want to stop

417
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,680
the new one

418
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
this this is exactly what was the only

419
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,920
music company director in europe was

420
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
also a member of the pirate party

421
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,440
they both hated me i was in both

422
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,360
paradigms okay so i stayed with the

423
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,160
pirates

424
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,199
there you go but anyway 1550

425
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,959
no more monks and nuns they're all

426
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,320
redundant they're all gone all over

427
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,959
europe

428
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,639
the average cost of producing a book is

429
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,800
30 cents

430
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
maybe there are slightly more books

431
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
around

432
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,120
make sense okay by the time you get to

433
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,440
paris 1789 in the french revolution

434
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,959
which is not really a revolution the

435
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,880
revolution happened in 1450

436
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,639
the french revolution is a symptom of a

437
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,000
revolution it's the result of the

438
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,800
revolution

439
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,399
the paradigm shift is happening now

440
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,480
because the technology is already there

441
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,600
why paris 1789 because paris in the

442
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
1780s had become the first city in the

443
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,000
world where

444
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,240
half the population could read and write

445
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,399
why because the cost of books had fallen

446
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,600
to nothing

447
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,360
you could publish a book every day full

448
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
of gossip and call it a tabloid

449
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,360
or you could just basically accumulate

450
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,959
all the information of everything that

451
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,079
ever happened in human history and

452
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,639
called an encyclopedia

453
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,399
great innovations france became the

454
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,000
center of the world paris took over the

455
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,720
world

456
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,040
11 years of digital libido chaos called

457
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,160
the french revolution

458
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,000
and finally one day a little corsican

459
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,079
dwarf steps onto the stage it's the year

460
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:12,880
1800

461
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
he's made a brilliant career through the

462
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,160
french army because they killed all the

463
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,279
aristocrats

464
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,279
so corsican dwarf is now the general and

465
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
he walks out of the bomber square in

466
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,680
paris and says

467
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
listen guys aren't you tired of all the

468
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,959
bloodshed and the mess because you don't

469
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,480
get that there's a paradigm shift going

470
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,199
on

471
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
i'll take over i'll be the dictator

472
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,399
that's

473
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,759
probably very liked what's going to

474
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,320
happen this time around too

475
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,920
but napoleon gave us the model

476
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,560
that we since then stuck with and the

477
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
model looks a bit like this

478
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,399
you put a corsican dwarf at the top of

479
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,920
the structure

480
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
underneath the corsican dwarf you have a

481
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,199
bunch of officers

482
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,120
underneath the officers a bunch of sub

483
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,440
officers and at the bottom of this

484
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,800
army or bureaucracy you put the cannon

485
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,120
fodder

486
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,759
information travels from the top down

487
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,360
with enormous efficiency

488
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,839
why because it's mass media and it's

489
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,000
cheap

490
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,519
in 1806 napoleon conquered all of europe

491
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,279
with napoleon's army he had fewer

492
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,120
soldiers in the nfbb won every battle

493
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,600
anyway

494
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,399
why because his soldiers could read and

495
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,000
write

496
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,680
he knew that if you create a structure

497
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,199
where even the canon photo at the bottom

498
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,560
of the hierarchy can read and write you

499
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,160
have a whole new society

500
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,240
he was a paradigmatic genius

501
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,320
he understood how to use written

502
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
language

503
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,199
maximally optimally and hegel

504
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,279
and nietzsche and all the other great

505
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,360
philosophers of the 19th century

506
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,440
love napoleon they consider him like a

507
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
messianic figure

508
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,720
and this model after hegel 1807

509
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,360
and the philosophy of spirit so widely

510
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,800
read philosophical work

511
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,480
became the model for how you organized

512
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,040
all of europe in the 19th century

513
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
europe had the fastest economic growth

514
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,759
we've ever seen in the 19th century

515
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,000
it also had a huge population increase

516
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,839
because people could survive in cities

517
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,240
instead of dying all the time

518
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,160
you could also organize everything in

519
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
that society according to this model

520
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,280
every nation state every bureaucracy

521
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,319
every government every corporation every

522
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,119
school

523
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,599
every hospital all of these institutions

524
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,079
put a doctor napoleon or mr napoleon at

525
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,880
the top

526
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
and then you report all the way down

527
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,679
with enormous efficiency

528
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,080
that's napoleon's army that's the model

529
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,720
europe built

530
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,480
built itself on and then the rest of the

531
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,640
world has just replicated it

532
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
so we have the nation-state model for

533
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,840
the rest of the world europe managed to

534
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,600
even conquer three other continents and

535
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
populate them in the same process

536
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,720
it's the most remarkable thing anybody

537
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,880
ever did in history was the european

538
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
conquest of the planet in the 19th

539
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,280
century

540
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,799
that's undeniably a fact

541
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,240
okay so

542
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,480
what end happens is that in the 20th

543
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,440
century

544
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
we get radio and television and please

545
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
look at this diagram

546
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,120
radio and television only reinforce the

547
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,320
mechanisms

548
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,919
that already come out of the printing

549
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,919
press that means that up until the 1980s

550
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,400
any management theorists or organization

551
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,160
theories anywhere in europe or anywhere

552
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,880
in the world

553
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,200
would teach this model as the optimal

554
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,039
model for how you organize a bunch of

555
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,720
people

556
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,880
makes sense huh you can't do it any

557
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,919
other way why

558
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,480
because that's how it works and mass

559
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,039
media controls the society

560
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,720
were you allowed to have a radio station

561
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,640
no you were not you either have to have

562
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,280
tons of

563
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,039
money or you had to have tons of

564
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,120
political influence

565
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,840
you either have to have money already or

566
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,760
political influence to run a radio

567
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,000
station same thing to run a tv station

568
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
same thing to run a newspaper so any of

569
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
these mechanisms with which you

570
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
controlled society

571
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
would have to be eligible to somebody

572
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,000
who either paid their way

573
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
or politically okayed to do it

574
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,600
usually both by the way so money in

575
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,480
politics was driving this paradigm

576
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,919
that's why i say should watch out we

577
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,120
talk too much about currencies it's

578
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,640
actually old paradigm talk so

579
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,440
there you go

580
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,520
so it's just value communication anyway

581
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
but this is how communication

582
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,640
operates in a napoleonic system

583
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,679
then the internet comes along

584
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,760
and it it up completely why

585
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,000
well somebody came up with their idea

586
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
that we should put the smartphone in the

587
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,559
hand of

588
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,799
seven billion people on the planet and

589
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,480
how do they react well they've learned

590
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,080
from the mass media society

591
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,240
that if you get a chance to speak you

592
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,360
deserve to have a large

593
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,880
audience and everybody will love you for

594
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,120
it and you have the talent to do it

595
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,880
so basically you take a society which is

596
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,240
like a social theater

597
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,000
and you have like tons of people sitting

598
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,360
there in the audience and you have a few

599
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
stars performing on a stage

600
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,440
and now you declare that oh this is the

601
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,200
internet and we're going to move

602
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
all of you people who are in the

603
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,480
audience up on the stage

604
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,760
and you're all going to be stars

605
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,520
i knew this was all the wrong things the

606
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,039
silicon valley would fail

607
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,799
when i worked for a record company and i

608
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,760
found out there was something called

609
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,679
myspace in 2003.

610
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,919
and i said myspace is just all the crap

611
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,679
 that we at record companies

612
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
avoid people from hearing because they

613
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,480
don't want to hear it and now all that

614
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,520
 is out there

615
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,200
and it's always americans who do this

616
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,559
americans always tell you you're

617
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,159
beautiful and you're fantastic and

618
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,760
you're talented and you're gonna win no

619
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,640
matter what

620
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,080
they always pull into believing

621
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,760
that don't they because they believe it

622
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,480
themselves

623
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
no matter how mediocre they are they

624
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
don't get nature so

625
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,919
anyway you got all these americans

626
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,559
telling you you're gonna be a star

627
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,159
everybody's putting up on the

628
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,600
on the internet

629
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,400
and then they're pretending to like each

630
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,880
other

631
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,960
when you hear somebody say thank you for

632
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,559
the ad

633
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,799
that is idiotic it's just like if i

634
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,720
added you it's probably because i knew

635
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,760
you saw would tell

636
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,000
a third person that you and i get along

637
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,200
and are friends

638
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
if i just added you to pretend that we

639
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
listen to each other's

640
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,159
that's facebook right i knew facebook

641
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,520
would fail the day they didn't have a

642
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,360
button you could push and dislike things

643
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,640
and remove people

644
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,960
because that's that's that then facebook

645
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,559
would have been grounded in reality but

646
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,200
it isn't

647
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,600
it's just a kindergarten so all this

648
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,720
 is going on

649
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
so the internet is essentially what

650
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
happened is the cannon fighters start

651
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,400
talking directly to each other

652
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,640
and that's fine it's decentralized we

653
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,600
like that right

654
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
eight billion people are talking

655
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
directly to each other or rather they're

656
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
shouting at each other with megaphones

657
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
called smartphones

658
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
and this chaos grows and grows and grows

659
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,360
and grows and grows

660
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,320
and this dies napoleon's dead and over

661
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,159
we hate the authorities yeah we're going

662
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,679
to be all kinds of little minority

663
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,200
groups so we're going to be offended as

664
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,360
long as we get attention

665
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,000
it's all about attention it's my time

666
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,120
now to speak it's not

667
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
time now to be a star it's all very very

668
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,480
infantile

669
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,520
but that's the internet operates until

670
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
now

671
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,919
okay what is the problem with this

672
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,000
structure

673
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,360
the problem with this structure is

674
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,200
naively flat

675
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
it says that we get 7 billion people on

676
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,120
the planet we all give them a smartphone

677
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,280
which they can afford

678
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,039
we all say they can get a gmail account

679
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,559
and a facebook account or a protomail

680
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,919
account or whatever account they want to

681
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,440
learn how to program and code it cost

682
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,480
them absolutely nothing

683
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,840
so the internet is moving towards zero

684
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,960
cost

685
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,240
doesn't cost anything to go online

686
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,039
it's gonna kill capitalism because the

687
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,480
point of capitalism was there were rare

688
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,159
resources and you paid for them

689
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,200
that's what have a deflation or

690
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
depression in the world economy other

691
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,240
people are throwing money at each other

692
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,320
and don't know what to do with it

693
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,600
they go crazy why is that

694
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,720
because we always look for a messiah or

695
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,559
a save and we create a mess like the

696
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,559
current one

697
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,799
the old paradigm will moralize against

698
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,760
the new paradigm

699
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,520
the old paradigm will tell us that this

700
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
fake news out there as if

701
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,679
newspapers hadn't always written fake

702
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,799
news

703
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,520
it was always north korean it was always

704
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,039
about licking somebody's ass it was

705
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,159
powerful

706
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,880
it was never decentralized it was never

707
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,320
spread among the people

708
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,000
people were fooled into believing that

709
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,679
once every four years you're gonna go

710
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,960
thankfully and put something in the

711
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,840
voting booth

712
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,200
and you're gonna be thankful because you

713
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,480
can do that the rest of the time you're

714
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,960
gonna rule you ask me please

715
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,720
and an academic and a politician

716
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,039
an industrialist all they need to do was

717
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,039
have a little dinner together and sort

718
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,159
of things in between them

719
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,000
and they could run any nation state as

720
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,559
they pleased

721
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,200
okay so they moralize against this mess

722
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,039
for good reasons yeah it's messy

723
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,720
it's tons of fake news it's actually

724
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
just a lot of

725
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,279
it's 99 junk but so was the previous

726
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,799
paradigm except it pretended to be

727
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,799
something else

728
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,919
so okay what solves the problem we hate

729
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,679
chaos

730
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,200
whenever in history where human beings

731
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,720
have come from chaos we go for

732
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,559
anything that remotely looks like order

733
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,880
in the chaos

734
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,200
germany was chaotic in 1933 that's why

735
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,640
they loved all of hitler

736
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,000
five years later out of hitler was the

737
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,720
most popular politician ever existed

738
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,200
95 of germans approved of out of

739
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,120
hitler's policies in 1938

740
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,960
the only five percent didn't were called

741
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,480
juice

742
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,200
you know so much for popularity so much

743
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,240
for people you

744
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,760
if you can trust people no if somebody

745
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,360
behaves like a phallic master

746
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,840
people go with it they go either with

747
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,720
the learning shmob

748
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,320
or they go with the exodus they either

749
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
go with the access to the promised land

750
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,960
or they go with a little spell and they

751
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,880
can't tell the difference

752
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,400
if he looks like a leader it must be a

753
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,320
leader if he says something please think

754
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,919
to you it's probably the tyrant

755
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,600
if he challenges you it's probably a

756
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,520
prophet but most people couldn't care

757
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,279
less about the difference

758
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,919
so we need order in the counts

759
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,520
thankfully

760
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,360
we human beings have not presented the

761
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,520
messianic savior yet or somebody who can

762
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,760
step in and you know stop the lynch mobs

763
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,880
and stop

764
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,200
stop the tyrants and be the messiah no

765
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,559
human actually is even

766
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,159
close to that role today but technology

767
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,159
is presented in savior

768
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,520
it's called the algorithm

769
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,600
the algorithm means that we just

770
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,760
accumulate all this data out here

771
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,799
and then we build an algorithm

772
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,799
phallic structure creates order in the

773
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,159
chaos

774
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,200
now if you build an algorithm at least

775
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,919
if you do a good algorithm

776
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,039
you take two factors

777
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,720
into perspective one of them is called

778
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,240
awareness

779
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,200
you multiply awareness with credibility

780
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,400
and you create a value called the

781
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,200
tangent value

782
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
that means uh if you're the best guy in

783
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,480
the world doing something but nobody

784
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,679
knows about it because he doesn't even

785
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,200
have a home page to tell anybody you

786
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
have no attention

787
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,320
if everybody knows who you are but they

788
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,679
all hate you you have no attention

789
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,679
it's a combination of awareness and

790
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,120
credibility that gives you attentional

791
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,679
value

792
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,279
this is the fundament of any algorithm

793
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,440
you build please note there are no money

794
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,760
signs

795
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,200
if you get on the top of a search engine

796
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,880
at least it should be because you just

797
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,480
happen to be the best in the world doing

798
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,360
what you're doing

799
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,520
regardless of quantity it measures

800
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,640
nothing but quality

801
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
how does it do that it measures who goes

802
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
to a certain webpage it measures how

803
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,360
long they stay

804
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,799
it measures what they do when they

805
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,400
interact with it it measures whether

806
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,240
they use their services or not

807
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,520
it measures whether it tells their

808
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,200
friends they like the experience or not

809
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,320
it certainly measures whether they

810
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,159
return or not

811
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,000
all the things that we human beings

812
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,279
value

813
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,880
that really nothing to do with money are

814
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,480
actually measured in algorithm

815
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,080
and they're measured every time you turn

816
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,840
on your smartphone or your laptop

817
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,320
so far so good as often when it comes to

818
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,279
freedom

819
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,679
the free estate of what you love if you

820
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,840
love freedom like we do

821
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,159
is free and the beginning and then it

822
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,440
gets destroyed

823
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,960
and that's actually what's happening

824
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,000
with all the algorithms right now

825
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,840
why for two reasons

826
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,240
the algorithm is attacked on one side by

827
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,520
the corruption

828
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,840
of money

829
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,240
on the other side the algorithm is

830
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,120
attacked

831
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:20,399
by the manipulation from politics

832
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,880
so we hear all these arguments that oh

833
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,159
but the algorithms must be controlled

834
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,000
we can't have free and open algorithms

835
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,440
we can't handle that

836
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,960
we're just children the old power

837
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,480
structure speaks to us and says the

838
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,360
algorithm is

839
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,080
evil if it's free and open because it

840
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,919
actually reflects human beings

841
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,520
and we can't have that no we must work

842
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,679
on improving human beings

843
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,279
let's mark on improving them in a

844
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,720
certain direction

845
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,399
oh and that direction happens to be

846
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,320
exactly like the old power structure so

847
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,600
we can fit in again

848
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,279
into mold power structure that's falling

849
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,520
apart that's exactly what we're seeing

850
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,279
today

851
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,159
we're seeing the algorithm attacked it's

852
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,679
attacked from politics

853
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,440
i love right now they probably have a

854
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,200
civil war at spotify new york at the

855
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,080
moment why

856
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,640
because spotify paid a hundred million

857
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,120
dollars to joe rogan to be a

858
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,360
so joe rogan sold his soul to spotify

859
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,799
and as soon as joe rogan was published

860
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,640
on spotify people discovered that the 10

861
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,399
most controversial episodes of the joe

862
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,320
rogan podcast have been removed

863
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,000
joe rogan had sold himself to an old

864
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,919
media company which is spotify is it's

865
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,640
not new

866
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,159
and he was new and fresh he was just

867
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,159
real he sold his soul to the devil for

868
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,440
100 million dollars

869
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,520
the rogan fans get really upset so what

870
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
jogen desperately does is that he goes

871
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,399
out and interviews some really

872
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,840
controversial woman i don't even

873
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,360
remember her name who's written a book

874
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,520
that transgender is the wrong thing and

875
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,200
classical women are right or whatever

876
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,880
you know it's just an opinion

877
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,440
he publishes that podcast on spotify and

878
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,600
spotify's headquarters go boom boom boom

879
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,880
boom boom

880
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,679
why because spotify have promised that

881
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,679
they employ people to make the world

882
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,520
better

883
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,600
it used to be churches that did that not

884
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,320
corporations

885
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,159
now where does this madness come from

886
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,000
the madness comes from the fact that

887
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,760
since the internet was launched in the

888
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,360
1980s we

889
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,720
have as a humanity together started

890
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,000
hating advertising we hate when people

891
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,679
contact us when we have a dashboard

892
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,120
we call it spam i love

893
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,000
ad blockers i love spam filters they're

894
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,679
probably some of the most amazing

895
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,159
innovations in mankind's history

896
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,240
because they alleviate us from all the

897
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,080
junk and nonsense that we do not want

898
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,919
because we want the free and open

899
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,919
algorithm we want to get to what we're

900
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,799
looking at when we go online

901
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,480
we don't want anybody to disturb that

902
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,480
process we want it to be free and open

903
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,120
so the advertisers in the 1980s have

904
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,919
gone into some kind of tail spin

905
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,000
where they first went into advertising

906
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,279
and later they didn't even call it

907
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,240
advertise start to call it

908
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,840
marketing and when they couldn't call

909
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,200
the market any longer they just started

910
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,039
calling it communication

911
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,320
and they tried to create some kind of a

912
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,159
dictatorship of the communication

913
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:02,880
agencies

914
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,840
that's basically capitalism in the 2020s

915
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,799
and it means that

916
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,520
yeah um we're selling a madras here in

917
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,320
manchester

918
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,919
but we're gonna pretend our corporation

919
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,440
is all about building bakeries in

920
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,919
burundi

921
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,039
that's corporations in the 2020s

922
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,840
it's completely devoid of reality no you

923
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,760
don't build bakers in burundi you build

924
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,440
mad dresses in manchester and i live in

925
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,640
manchester that won't have a

926
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,520
madras

927
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,120
i don't need a story told about matters

928
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,840
i want an address i want a thing

929
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,360
a product best product best price

930
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,480
no but all this pretentious nonsense

931
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,240
has been put on the top of messages from

932
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,480
the old power structures

933
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,520
from corporations from nation states

934
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,760
from mass media and most of all the

935
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,440
worst and most academics

936
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,520
i'm sure the academics will die in the

937
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,720
next 10 years

938
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,640
it's so ripe for tech startups right now

939
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,559
to just kill it

940
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,200
it cost you 55 000 dollars to end

941
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
harvard to attend harvard this fall

942
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,640
55 000 for one semester online

943
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,200
you can go to fuckingpraxis.com and get

944
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,880
exactly the same courses with better

945
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,840
professors

946
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,159
fairer testing no quote us when it comes

947
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,840
to student approval either so that means

948
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,120
you're smart if you do it

949
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,559
and you then test and certify you've

950
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,320
been to praxis.com for twelve hundred

951
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,000
dollars

952
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,519
that's exactly how the new paradigm

953
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,440
kills the old just like the last time

954
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,960
far lower costs and of course there's

955
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,399
the corruption of money coming in the

956
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,679
other party

957
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,039
so google at least tried to keep the ads

958
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,480
separate from the search the ad was like

959
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,200
separate

960
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,919
it's like old paradigm is ad you pay to

961
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,120
be seen you pay

962
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,480
for having people's eyeballs being

963
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,799
disturbed with you now why do you pay

964
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,200
for an ad

965
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,640
but you pay for an ad in internet

966
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,000
society you're paying for that because

967
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,519
you're so rubbish at what you do

968
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,720
so you're getting desperate about it so

969
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,200
you pay your way to getting attention

970
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,679
everybody knows that when you do google

971
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,559
search 99 of people press the search

972
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,320
which is algorithmic they don't press

973
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,559
the ad and google still fancies them to

974
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,120
believe

975
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,799
that the ad is important to have there

976
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,559
that's why people pay way too much for

977
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,919
having google ads because google ads

978
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,120
don't result in anything

979
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,799
why because we hate ads

980
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,320
you know youtube a couple of finnish

981
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,519
sociologists did an interesting

982
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,480
experiment last year

983
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,080
you know youtube how you get a

984
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,320
ad you have to remove the ad and you

985
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,440
want to remove that as quickly as

986
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,720
possible because you hate it because you

987
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,320
want to have jeroen or whatever

988
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,559
instead right so they did a test last

989
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,519
year and it showed that

990
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,240
out of a thousand times that people use

991
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,799
youtube

992
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,399
992 out of a thousand times they press

993
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,080
the button exactly after five seconds to

994
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,720
get rid of the ad

995
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,279
imagine you're a guy who goes to a bar

996
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,679
here in prague on a friday night

997
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,559
you walk into the bar and 992 out of a

998
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,399
thousand women spit you in the face as

999
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,440
soon as they see you

1000
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,720
wouldn't you just go home and hang

1001
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,039
yourself

1002
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,080
i think corporations should i think

1003
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,760
they're horrible

1004
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,000
i don't want them they prove no value at

1005
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,440
all in my life

1006
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,519
yes i've created a chaos together with

1007
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,880
seven billion other people who throw all

1008
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,000
kinds of out there

1009
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,279
but if the algorithm is going to be

1010
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,360
around it can sort that out for me

1011
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,399
so i don't want the corruption of money

1012
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,159
and the irony is that google tried to

1013
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,760
keep the ad set from the search oh they

1014
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,279
put the ads more and more in your face

1015
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,640
because the other thing at google that

1016
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,679
makes money for them

1017
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,000
is actually google search still in 2020

1018
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,159
it's ripe for takeover right now

1019
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,000
and google therefore have employed 50

1020
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
000 people in mountain view whose job is

1021
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,000
basically

1022
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,840
to tell people how to cheat their way up

1023
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,519
the algorithm

1024
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,039
because they can't have the ad within

1025
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,600
the algorithm because then to be corrupt

1026
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,720
okay that is one of the nastiest things

1027
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,760
people could do it's called

1028
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,440
search optimization i've heard about

1029
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,039
that

1030
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,158
isn't that pure evil

1031
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,600
organized lying

1032
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,399
i met with volkswagen in stuttgart in

1033
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,000
germany a few years ago was one of those

1034
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,799
things where they bring

1035
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,799
in the philosopher to test try their

1036
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,639
things the ideas they're up to

1037
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,800
and um i basically told them why you

1038
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,159
were spending 40 million dollars in

1039
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,839
search optimization in europe

1040
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,359
and volkswagen said well we hope to get

1041
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,879
a written algorithm

1042
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,320
so you spent 40 million dollars in

1043
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,800
cheating and lying

1044
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,960
yeah okay you're germans and you spent

1045
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,399
40 million dollars in cheating and lying

1046
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,440
i thought you were better than that in

1047
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,560
germany

1048
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,719
well one of the guys raised his hand and

1049
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,800
said well alexandria if you don't spend

1050
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,320
40 million dollars on search

1051
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,679
optimization what are going to spend the

1052
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,000
money

1053
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,159
on i looked him in the eye and said how

1054
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,918
about building a better car

1055
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,879
stupid they had the diesel engine

1056
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,399
scandal the year after

1057
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,879
right it's just it's just the algorithm

1058
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,199
is merciless and you've learned it from

1059
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,199
bitcoin the thing about the internet the

1060
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,560
thing about digital is that it's

1061
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,440
merciless with bullshitting merciless it

1062
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,040
doesn't buy into the

1063
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,800
if you look at collectively the data

1064
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,880
from tons of people who use a certain

1065
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,480
service the way the algoma percentage of

1066
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,839
the algorithm will give you the truth

1067
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,599
the only concern you got left

1068
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,880
is that how the free and open algorithm

1069
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,720
is constructed for you is interesting

1070
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,680
here

1071
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,079
this way we go really into paradigmatics

1072
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,200
and this is where i want to challenge

1073
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,320
you

1074
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,160
don't settle for being mediocre

1075
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,760
paradigmatically just because your

1076
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,440
neighbor is bad at it

1077
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,720
don't settle for the standards of the

1078
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,240
tech giants in silicon valley they were

1079
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,839
doomed 10 years ago yeah they would be

1080
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,599
the first wave of sort of an infantile

1081
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,640
internet but they're not going to be the

1082
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,160
end of it at all

1083
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,720
bitcoin will survive all of them crypto

1084
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,920
will certainly survive all of them

1085
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,359
cryptos the biggest revolution to

1086
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,800
contract writing we've had since we've

1087
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
invented written language

1088
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,400
thousands of strangers can start

1089
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,960
communicating with each other with trust

1090
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,400
because of crypto it's fantastic it's

1091
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,079
potential it's enormous

1092
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,240
and all of these new technologies we're

1093
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,440
developing right now

1094
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,839
are getting rid of to go

1095
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,440
towards the truth

1096
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,760
the factual truth it's all about reality

1097
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,599
it's not about different stories being

1098
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,440
told post-modernism is over

1099
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,359
did it so killed it it's real

1100
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,920
but here's the thing a free and open

1101
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,560
algorithm

1102
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,160
will reflect you it will reflect your

1103
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,920
friends

1104
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,880
it will reflect your family your clan

1105
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,480
your tribe

1106
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,880
it will reflect the context you created

1107
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,320
for yourself towards finding truth

1108
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,880
if you trust a neighbor to trust a

1109
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,560
friend with parents often if they trust

1110
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,240
their kids

1111
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,720
that'll be part of your algorithm the

1112
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,400
algorithm should really be called you

1113
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:40,800
know

1114
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,880
yesterday's magic is always tomorrow's

1115
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,200
technology i would say the algorithm the

1116
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,960
free and open algorithm is like an

1117
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,240
angel it follows your entire life

1118
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,880
it develops itself with you but that

1119
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,720
also means because it reflects

1120
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,880
the existential choices you make in your

1121
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,320
life

1122
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,880
here's the trick the algorithm can even

1123
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,640
put you into the underclass

1124
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,480
full of slave mentality in the internet

1125
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,720
world or you can put at the very top of

1126
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,560
things being heroic and autocratic in

1127
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,839
the internet world

1128
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,560
and the small difference between the two

1129
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,599
is all about

1130
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,760
whether you like to be challenged

1131
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,520
the echo chambers are underclass

1132
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,680
phenomena

1133
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
they're typical examples of what losers

1134
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,040
do when they get a panic

1135
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,400
they isolate themselves to people who

1136
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,079
agree with them all the time

1137
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,920
and then they become a lynch mob because

1138
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,119
the only way they can keep together and

1139
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,480
have a dialogue with each other just

1140
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,079
agree with everything

1141
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,760
is by finding somebody outside of the

1142
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
system they can go after

1143
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
this is why hitler and the jew stalin

1144
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,520
and the kulak mao and the cultural

1145
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,240
revolution

1146
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,680
all these things are now coming back to

1147
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,200
the west in the terms of war culture

1148
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,119
it's all a bunch of losers who feel they

1149
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,119
have the right to take the losing

1150
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,440
mentality the slave mentality out on

1151
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,359
everybody else

1152
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,280
it's the rosalind lynch mobs on the back

1153
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,680
again and the only defense we have

1154
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,440
against those it's a word that i call

1155
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,560
antagony not antagonism

1156
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,440
but antagony to be antagonic is not to

1157
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,480
be antagonistic

1158
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,320
to be antigonic is to look for people

1159
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,960
who challenge you at all times

1160
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,400
then you get out of the echo chambers

1161
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,760
quickly and then you arrive in

1162
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,280
communities that people don't agree with

1163
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,680
you

1164
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,440
they have different points of view they

1165
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,720
have different stories to tell

1166
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,240
the different backgrounds and what

1167
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,320
happens to you your algorithm gets

1168
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,160
better and you get smarter

1169
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,839
to the nethercrack world thank you for

1170
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:47,440
having me

1171
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,359
alexander thanks a lot for very

1172
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,200
impressive presentation

1173
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,400
and i think we have some free time for

1174
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,079
a few questions so any questions and

1175
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,000
don't hesitate

1176
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,920
ask be antagonic

1177
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,920
microphone what is the free

1178
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,760
algorithm actually built up by

1179
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,839
the the algorithm is basically very

1180
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,440
simple it's awareness and credibility

1181
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,280
and you can add other factors to the

1182
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,800
problem with google when working google

1183
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,920
at the moment is that they try to add a

1184
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,119
lot of things that are political

1185
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,119
or they get corrupted by the money and

1186
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,880
basically warning them we said i

1187
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,480
think i don't think it's that expensive

1188
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,000
to building the algorithm

1189
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,560
at all or to build search for that the

1190
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,760
way i would describe it among

1191
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,839
activists like you we're all activists

1192
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,480
in the room is that i i preach

1193
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,839
a principle that i call technological

1194
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,400
sufficiency

1195
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,320
so always go for the technology that is

1196
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,000
sufficient for your needs

1197
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,440
not necessarily the best one because the

1198
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,119
big tech giants will certainly beat them

1199
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,320
at you know being

1200
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,200
better but go for the experience that is

1201
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,640
good enough for you

1202
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,240
but that provides you with the maximum

1203
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,320
amount of freedom

1204
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
the irony in all this is because it's so

1205
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,839
brutally honest

1206
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,760
is that if you operate according to

1207
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,920
freedom as your main principle

1208
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,200
and your technologically sufficient

1209
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,119
everything you do you'll be very popular

1210
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,200
with other freedom lovers

1211
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,280
so your algorithm points you towards

1212
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,880
people who are antagonic with you but

1213
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,760
love freedom

1214
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,520
and i think loving freedom is the only

1215
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,040
value we need to share right now

1216
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,960
and if you focus on loving freedom and

1217
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,319
everything else is dependent on that

1218
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,000
including bitcoin for example

1219
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
then you maximize that you maximize that

1220
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,680
in your behavior then i would say right

1221
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
now to see where twitter is heading

1222
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,599
compared to gab or parlor or whatever

1223
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,960
when everything you use

1224
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,640
duckduckgo it's not as good as google

1225
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,160
search people use it anyway we use

1226
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,000
protonmail instead of gmail what we get

1227
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,200
away from the tech giants

1228
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,119
and this is a healthy sign of

1229
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,440
understanding that by not compromising

1230
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,720
on my freedom

1231
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,480
as long as i get a technologically

1232
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,560
sufficient solution to what i do

1233
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,280
i'll be ahead of the game scatterbot is

1234
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,160
perfect for this

1235
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,640
hard drives everywhere no data centers

1236
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,400
totally decentralized and any hacker in

1237
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,079
the world who wanted to be on facebook

1238
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,599
the real facebook are now creating

1239
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,800
scuttlebutt instead fantastic mechanisms

1240
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,839
great stuff really innovative creative

1241
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,000
decentralized

1242
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,599
bottom up all of them

1243
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,760
so i mean we don't need top down because

1244
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,839
we have algorithms that's the point

1245
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,359
we don't need to look for the messiah

1246
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,440
right now because whatever technology is

1247
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,319
delivered to us

1248
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,839
technology is delivered the savior it's

1249
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,839
called the algorithm that's exactly what

1250
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,079
algorithms is the real war

1251
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,599
the real war the next 30 years the war

1252
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,920
of the algorithms and if you look into

1253
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,680
an algorithm today coming from a big

1254
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,280
tech giant it's already corrupted and

1255
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,680
manipulated like that

1256
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,880
so start by i would propose actually

1257
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,640
maybe starting here

1258
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,400
unless somebody's overdone it to have a

1259
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,400
free and open algorithm movement

1260
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,000
and then bitcoin all these other stuff

1261
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,119
that we have these technologies we

1262
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,960
cannot manipulate we'll be part of that

1263
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,319
but i think the free and open argument

1264
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,319
has to be fought for

1265
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,599
it's almost a messianic cause

1266
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,359
yep so um

1267
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,400
within the impressive framework of

1268
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,480
information transformation um

1269
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,599
i wonder what would be the in your

1270
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,520
opinion the

1271
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,079
interesting applications of crypto

1272
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,640
because we are in a crypto

1273
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,680
place currently

1274
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,240
i think this is this is all about time

1275
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,359
space is gone everything in the world

1276
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,040
today because of digital travels within

1277
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,880
a microsecond across the world

1278
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,079
you might have a problem playing

1279
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,359
computer games you're stuck in new

1280
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,480
zealand playing with somebody from

1281
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,319
svalbard but that's very minor right

1282
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,599
and that's because you're good but

1283
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,960
rather than that actually everything

1284
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,720
travels so fast the space is gone this

1285
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,760
is all about time

1286
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,680
it's all about the time constraints it's

1287
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,040
all about the time axis

1288
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,520
so everything from now on will by us

1289
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,200
naturally be valued according to how

1290
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,040
much time does it consume for us

1291
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,480
that's if we want to get rid of anything

1292
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,640
in the way at blocker spam filters

1293
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,240
everything that disturbs us it won't

1294
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,920
have a clean pure communication

1295
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,839
so then i would say the crypto where

1296
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,280
crypto comes in is that

1297
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
when you have a need to lock in

1298
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,599
something along the time access i said

1299
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,200
this undeniably happened here okay

1300
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,040
you can't change that then you're going

1301
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,400
to kill the nation states

1302
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,599
you're going to kill corporations that

1303
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,880
we know them you're going to kill

1304
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,240
anything from the old paradigm

1305
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,680
you're going to kill anything that looks

1306
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,760
the slightest bit legal or judicial

1307
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,280
because you're going to have a mechanism

1308
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,800
where we always know that with a

1309
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,640
contract it's always the last paragraph

1310
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,760
in the contract the only thing that's

1311
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,880
important i know it from the music

1312
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,480
industry it's only the last paragraph

1313
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,920
and the last paragraph says in case

1314
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,359
there is a conflict between these two

1315
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,720
parties this is where they go here's the

1316
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,839
arbiter

1317
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,800
and if the arbiter cannot be removed or

1318
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,480
changed and is fixed

1319
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
that means you can lock history in

1320
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,920
forever it's almost like a platonic

1321
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,359
fantasy but it's all about the path

1322
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,800
you can lock history forever and cannot

1323
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,880
change it so that also means if you are

1324
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,480
private about something or you do

1325
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,680
something you don't want your wife to

1326
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,400
know

1327
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,280
don't use crypto with it because it will

1328
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,280
be locked in forever in time

1329
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,839
uh unfortunately we are out of our time

1330
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,400
maybe

1331
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,520
very last very fast question and fast

1332
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,040
answer yeah if okay okay i got my

1333
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,279
answer so i will pass it yeah okay

1334
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,480
okay it may not be so fast but could you

1335
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,119
comment about forgiveness in the digital

1336
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,720
age with the permanent record

1337
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,400
and everything we do online will be

1338
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,839
saved forever and so on

1339
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,680
thank you that's what we're doing

1340
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,160
theology next um

1341
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,200
yeah that's part of what both culture

1342
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,119
has exposed is that anything you've done

1343
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,119
in the past will be held against you

1344
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,960
uh now if we do that whatever human

1345
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,319
being on the planet we don't get a

1346
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,760
second chance

1347
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,960
and that's the brilliance of

1348
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,480
entrepreneurship is you get second you

1349
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,599
get third chances

1350
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,640
that's how we go to the world of

1351
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,640
theology religion taught us a lot of

1352
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,480
things it domesticated us has kept us in

1353
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,760
our place it gave us the constraints so

1354
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,319
we could be

1355
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,839
creative that's what religion is

1356
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,280
interesting to go back to it's a

1357
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,800
theological question

1358
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,599
if we don't implement generously

1359
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,240
implement

1360
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,160
forgiveness in this process there's no

1361
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,960
way any one of us will take any risks

1362
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,560
and what i hold against corporations

1363
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,200
today when i talk to the corporations

1364
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,599
is that i said you are supposed to be

1365
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,960
risk takers you cannot be

1366
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,240
entrepreneurial without being a risk

1367
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,520
taker you're not going to not run a

1368
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,880
company corporation without being a risk

1369
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,160
taker that's fundamentally

1370
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,000
for doing business at all but since all

1371
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,920
the systems now are all about avoiding

1372
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,359
risk

1373
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,440
like don't ever say anything that could

1374
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,040
offend anybody

1375
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,680
but if you if you're never going to say

1376
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,359
anything that could offend anybody i can

1377
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,880
guarantee that your message would not be

1378
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,240
read by anybody because it'd be so

1379
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,079
 boring that nobody wants to read

1380
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:36,800
it

1381
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,000
you'll be dead without libido

1382
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,839
martinal and i think right now we're

1383
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,280
moving into a very sort of drastic

1384
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:43,920
martini

1385
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,359
stage where people are totally scared

1386
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,040
and terrified all the things that got

1387
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,240
around it because the understanding

1388
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,680
according to the old paradigm

1389
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,040
which is that somebody will write about

1390
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,319
you in the newspaper if you do the wrong

1391
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,440
thing

1392
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,119
but that nobody reads the newspaper any

1393
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,599
longer anyway so you need to actually

1394
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,599
create subcultures of people who say

1395
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,599
we're the misfits we made 50

1396
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,359
mistakes we touched women in the wrong

1397
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:03,839
place

1398
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,440
we were hanged out during me too

1399
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,960
actually we didn't die but we almost

1400
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,520
died

1401
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,800
now we're around anyway what are you

1402
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,839
going to do with us and we're whole

1403
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,760
 subcultural people or misfits

1404
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,839
and we called it the culture of

1405
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,319
forgiveness

1406
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,599
i think those things are going to come

1407
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,599
next we need them desperate the next 10

1408
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,640
years because otherwise

1409
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,760
we're not going to go back to risk

1410
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,520
taking and none of you guys are going to

1411
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,280
succeed at anything you do unless you

1412
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,319
start taking risks

1413
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,680
including talking to people you

1414
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,520
disapprove with

1415
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,200
okay alexander thanks a lot for a

1416
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:43,540
comprehensive thank you so much

1417
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,480
[Applause]

1418
