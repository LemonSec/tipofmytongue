centralized government

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,960

from getting out to the frog but

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,359

um as you can see there

69
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,560
uh this is our where we lived

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,080
uh for a few months off the coast of

71
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,319
thailand the way this thing

72
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,440
works is it's a spar design um kind of

73
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
like the oil rig

74
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
next slide

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,640
um so you have underneath a spark

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,200
the one in our our home it went 20

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,480
meters down

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,360
and we had just a little a little

79
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
fiberglass home on top it was

80
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400

81
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,519

82
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,120
it's just a six meter wide octagon

83
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
[Music]

84
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
we had a kitchen bathroom bedroom

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
where we can hang out as you can see uh

86
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
but it was

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
we were 13 miles out it was

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,480
it was beautiful and we just love living

89
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,760
there

90
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360
now you can yeah the part that

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,918
we living on the open ocean i lied about

92
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,478
it

93
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,519
it's very quiet you know no tower

94
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,320
allowed

95
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,440
no traffic it's just just us

96
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,400
there right that way but every time when

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,880
we come back to tao phuket we see all

98
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,680
the traffic

99
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,160
you didn't have the motorcycle accident

100
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,120
it just

101
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,160
go very slow and someone just pop up on

102
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,720
your

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,120
in in the front of your car and then

104
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,320
hitting you and

105
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880
you know it's got your accident every

106
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
time when we come and we shopping you

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
wish that we want to go back there

108
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,520
quit as possible because it's there it's

109
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
nothing you don't have to spend money

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,600
because we already spent in town stock

111
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
all your food

112
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
and in the morning you see all the sun

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
when the sun dried there with

114
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,199
nothing nothing uh

115
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,000
behind the scenes i don't know how to

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
say that

117
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,320
it's very beautiful it's just

118
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,280
380 videos like just come up just like

119
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,160
that

120
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,160
but it's quite scary when we have uh

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,639
the wind when define us come in for like

122
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,280
a week

123
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,400
that we have to live in there that

124
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,320
kind of scary only one part

125
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
yeah the the key thing for the home uh

126
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,039
like i said it's 13 miles out

127
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,080
um that puts us outside of thai

128
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,919
territorial waters that means

129
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,720
they're drilling for oil or interfering

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,680
with customs

131
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,960
uh we we have we're not breaking any

132
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,360
laws

133
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,400
um we were basically uh we were free

134
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,840
i mean we're we weren't really doing

135
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,400
anything out there we wouldn't do on

136
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,039
land

137
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,360
uh we don't tend to break laws or

138
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
anything but um

139
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,000
it's just that feeling uh kind of the

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,160
feeling free

141
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,600
i can't describe in words that

142
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,759
it was just awesome and knowing that we

143
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,160
were free just for a moment

144
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
it was exhilarating and we have been

145
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,479
working

146
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,919
every day to get back to that um but

147
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,280
so as you may have heard um in the

148
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,479
international news

149
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,160
we the thai navy kind of took issue with

150
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,600
our house being out there

151
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,919
um we won't get into their actual

152
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,919
reasons but uh

153
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,280
the they declared that we violated their

154
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,560
national sovereignty

155
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
and they threatened us with the death

156
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,759
penalty

157
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,000
should they should they catch us so

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
we

159
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,360
we thailand we sailed for 10 days on a

160
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,479
sailboat down the streets of mayaka

161
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,319
um down to singapore it was

162
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,560
it was long difficult they were

163
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,000
basically

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,599
um we're running from the navy

165
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
and we're under threat of death so it

166
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,800
was

167
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
it was difficult um

168
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,360
but uh we'll we'll leave the long story

169
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,919
for that

170
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,599

long version for that yeah

173
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,160
on the way to singapore

174
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,880
it's terrible really terrible

175
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,960
we failed the boat running through

176
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,599
lightning storm and i'm very

177
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,960
freaked out like really scary

178
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,000
even afraid to take a picture from my

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,560
phone like oh they're gonna catch me

180
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,319
they cannot hack me

181
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,520
you know like everything's so annoying

182
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,840
like even you see the barbecue wasn't it

183
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,560
even chad also also have that feeling

184
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,800
when he did at the same place uh

185
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,080
on the walls like i did

186
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,240
yeah he's kind of very athletic and

187
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,919
exciting helicopter and

188
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,319
you know uh what what's that called

189
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,599
just fry and butters floral navy's boat

190
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,559
from senior

191
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,159
gun on the board like it was yeah it was

192
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,958
just worth your while a long difficult

193
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,640
adventure but uh

194
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
fortunately we did make it to singapore

195
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,320
and once we got to singapore we

196
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
we immed immediately flew to panama

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,279
we made it and we were able to meet

198
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,080
these guys from frogs it was awesome we

199
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
were they were actually the first guys

200
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
we were able

201
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
we were willing to leave the our

202
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,920
seclusion and

203
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,720
talk to you so they just invited us to

204
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,480
their conference and i really appreciate

205
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,600
that

206
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
um so

207
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,000
what the concept of seasteading uh if

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,959
you guys don't know

209
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,160
is um it's basically homesteading and

210
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,279
the sea the ocean the world is covered

211
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,320
75

212
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,839
70 by water and

213
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,200
so you know why not use

214
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,680
use the water real estate instead of uh

215
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
worrying about going to mars or whatever

216
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,600
we're not using the full fast view

217
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,640
of the earth yet so that's that's the

218
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,920
concept

219
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
uh if you ever thought of oh we should

220
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,519
just get an island go move to an island

221
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,040
well every piece of land

222
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
all over the world is owned by a

223
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,519
government so if you get on that island

224
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,080
you're

225
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,240
under control of some government if you

226
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,200
go

227
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
12 miles out you don't have territory

228
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,480
laws if you go

229
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,959
200 miles out you don't have any you're

230
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,160
not under any nation

231
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,319
so

232
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,839
[Music]

233
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
the way i like it is you get to

234
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
experiment with governance

235
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,120
um which which is what

236
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
well we think uh you know bitcoin and

237
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,800
cryptocurrency and crypto everything

238
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,000
you can uh experiment with something new

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,519
that the government's not using

240
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,880
um bitcoin came out came along and

241
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,880
it showed us there's another way for

242
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,959
our currency that's what we would like

243
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,200
to show that there's other ways

244
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,680
for governance and that's

245
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,720
that's what we're looking at um

246
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,160
so yeah kovid

247
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,519
really gave us all a wake-up call about

248
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,880
um how much tyranny can take over

249
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,360
the whole world not just your country

250
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,640
but

251
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,200
they they came at everybody there was no

252
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
place to

253
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,040
no country that was uh free was what's

254
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,279
this whole this whole thing came along

255
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,800
so

256
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,320
what we need to do is we need sea

257
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,880
setting to happen um

258
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,760
and we're definitely working to make it

259
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,040
happen for everybody

260
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,640
um see setting right now we say is

261
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,640
like bitcoin was 10 years ago we put the

262
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,680
sea said in the water on january 9th

263
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,079
of 2019 exactly 10 years after satoshi

264
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,279
mind his first bitcoins so uh where do

265
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,839
we go from here

266
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,279
um while we're here in panama we're not

267
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,880
just sitting around enjoying the

268
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,000
beautiful weather um we've been working

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,720
hard

270
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,680
for our next slide

271
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,440
so we went from our our old octagon

272
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,160
house to this upgraded nicer

273
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,079
um design uh we called it

274
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,160
building those right now we're down here

275
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,399
in panama setting up the manufacturing

276
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,600
facility setting everything up for

277
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
um building these on the on the water

278
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,639
the idea being that

279
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,079
at least here in panama let's walk

280
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,560
before we run we

281
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,160
will get the building process down

282
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,600
manufacturing

283
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,639
bring the prices down

284
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,639
things straightened out we'll be parking

285
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,519
them

286
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,160
right in the water back here in the

287
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,800
leeward

288
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,160
side of an island and

289
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,839
where the water is kind of calm and

290
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,839
it'll give people kind of the the first

291
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,839
taste of

292
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,320
what it is to live on the ocean so we're

293
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
going to be recycling and

294
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,040
using water and you know treating our

295
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,839
waste

296
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,399
next slide

297
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
things like um shower loop technology

298
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,560
we're we're using all

299
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,959
as much future technology in this home

300
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,079
as we can

301
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,800
shower loop technology allows you to re

302
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,560
reuse the water over and over

303
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,399
uh after it's filtered while you're

304
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,320
taking a shower uh next slide

305
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,880
uh the nibia um it does a

306
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,760
a spray on you that conserves the water

307
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,320
so

308
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,440
we're definitely trying to get the water

309
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
usage down next slide

310
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,399
um and everybody always asks you where

311
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,360
does the poop go

312
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,800
so we use a composting toilet uh we

313
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
we're trying to make it so it's it's the

314
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,839
exact same

315
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,800
experiment experience as in your house

316
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,680
we're looking for

317
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,880
like four or five star um

318
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,079
living so we want everything to be

319
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,040
perfectly perfectly natural like you get

320
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,760
in a nice

321
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,360
five-star hotel next slide

322
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,480
uh to do this big project the

323
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,600
large largest 3d printer in latin

324
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
america

325
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,560
is 20 feet by 16 feet

326
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,920
with eight feet tall so we're able to

327
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,880
construct our very our our houses

328
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,320
basically

329
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,760
um very a lot easier than it would be

330
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,959
and we can do nicer angles and

331
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,160
make everything curves um so

332
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,639
next time

333
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,240
uh we we're customizing the whole house

334
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
i mean it's it's gonna be great

335
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,120
you can power so you can climb up and go

336
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,600
up

337
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,720
the top next slide

338
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
we're gonna be using solar panel the

339
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
solar power to

340
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,320
power it uh we can also use um

341
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,279
natural gas generators and uh

342
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,680
and and there's uh we're look working

343
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,880
with some

344
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,279
crypto folks on a decentralized power

345
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,399
grid where you just

346
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,320
uh say you're gone

347
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,560
uh a couple days or a week from your

348
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,519
house but your

349
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,000
solar panels are still using generating

350
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,600
electricity

351
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,079
you can share that power with the

352
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,240
network in the period of clear fashion

353
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,519
next slide uh

354
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,480
we'll be water independent so we can

355
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,120
turn turn the ocean water into your your

356
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,480
regular water

357
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,720
um i guess that's that's one of these

358
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,199
things that

359
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,160
big world governments are trying to just

360
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,800
control

361
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,880
the water with this you'll have water in

362
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,279
minutes

363
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,040
um yeah we're trying to make it super

364
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,199
high-tech

365
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,920
everything tech related you'll be able

366
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,279
to put your phone down like on the

367
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:13,920
counter

368
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,120
and it'll charge it

369
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,600
next slide um and

370
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,360
we have uh one of the founders of

371
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,160
ethereum working for us on a mesh

372
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,120
internet

373
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,240
uh that he's already got working um

374
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
connection uh he can share with

375
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,279
everybody else and

376
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,880
if somebody else has a better connection

377
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,079
or lower rate um it's all peer-to-peer

378
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,160
uh you can have a black blockchain based

379
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,240
subscription service and you can pay for

380
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,800
it

381
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,758
using uh cryptocurrency it's like

382
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,720
and we're going to be setting everything

383
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,040
up

384
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,000
blockchain based the ownership of the

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,559
homes

386
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,760
you can you can buy in crypto have it

387
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,959
registered on the

388
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,119
blockchain that you own it and it'll be

389
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,079
a

390
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,839
it'd be a signed contract um

391
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,240
cryptographically

392
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,199
um managed but you'll be able to take

393
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:21,919
that

394
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,839
being in panama will actually have a

395
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,919
contract that says you know this

396
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,360
science crypto contract

397
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,440
the owner it's completely

398
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,640
legal with panama we've actually met

399
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,160
with the panama government

400
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,679
they are definitely um on board they

401
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,280
they love the concept so they've been

402
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,880
very welcoming

403
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,400
as opposed to thailand so we're

404
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,520
we're moving forward in in panama it's

405
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,640
gonna be

406
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
it's gonna be great i mean the the

407
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,160
location we have here

408
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,280
is is perfect um

409
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,600
people that come out here they they say

410
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,559
you know

411
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,400
if this was a western country would be

412
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
even star resorts here because it's just

413
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
so beautiful it's untouched

414
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,640
unfortunately so because our homes are

415
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,760
floating

416
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,679
we're not disturbing any of that beauty

417
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,600
the natural beauty that's around here

418
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,170

it's quite nice but

435
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,440
we might have to work some more about

436
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,400
high-tech thing

437
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,280
we have to bring technology come to this

438
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,880
way to make it

439
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,039
more uh people like

440
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,360

so back to the beginning of the year um

461
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,840
next slide

462
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,360
oh yeah we everything high-tech we're

463
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:39,919
gonna be

464
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,400
we've got working with a drone company

465
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,440
to deliver

466
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,039
your drone so uh for covid if you're

467
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,080
stuck in your house

468
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,280
um you know beautiful weather you're

469
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,360
in your your house you can go scuba

470
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,200

uh you get all your food delivered by uh

472
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,919
drone service and your

473
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,240
garbage picked up taken off our next

474
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,480
slide

475
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,520
so at the beginning of the year we began

476
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,840
setting up our manufacturing plant

477
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,120
um cove it hit and it slowed things down

478
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,080
a little bit but we made sure to uh

479
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,360
kind of power through that and and get

480
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,880
things going because we

481
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,440
we don't wanna

482
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,840
stop us the next slide

483
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,000
uh here's our manufacturing plants um

484
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,400
just two days ago i took that picture so

485
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,080
that's our

486
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,200
forms for the house the ribs and we just

487
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,120
need to cover those with fiberglass and

488
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,840
uh

489
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,159
you can see in the back there's the the

490
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,280
center

491
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,200
tube of the home so

492
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,080
it's pretty tall it's very very big so

493
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,200
it's gonna be

494
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,280
a very nice home but uh

495
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,520
here we we can only build so many we

496
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,559
know

497
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,960
i mean with the coven the reaction to

498
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,840
kovid

499
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,159
we had with so much people so many

500
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,919
people want to come down here it's just

501
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
crazy

502
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,039
um and and we need to we need to create

503
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,360
that

504
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,280
for for people we needed the escape

505
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,320
it's it's necessary

506
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,918
so we're trying to ramp it up

507
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
with our management process we can maybe

508
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
do one

509
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,440
one or two homes uh

510
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,039
a month so i mean in a year we can help

511
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,240
20 people escape from wherever they are

512
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,280
right now

513
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,200
but but that's that's just not enough

514
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
we we needed to to kick things up a

515
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,120
little bit

516
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,600
and with kobit we started brainstorming

517
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,480
of

518
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,840
how can we how can we help and

519
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,679
bring more people down and so we

520
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,360
we saw that price acting

521
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,240
really hard um it sucks for them but for

522
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,280
us freedom lovers uh it became an

523
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,000
opportunity

524
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,400
so um next slide

525
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,600
yeah yeah and then we

526
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,039
made it to be by the cruiser so

527
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,320
we bought a cruise ship uh

528
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,799
just closing it down on it at the end of

529
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,679
the month

530
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,280
but it should be um should be here

531
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,640
in panama by uh december

532
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,279
so we're gonna call it the crypto cruise

533
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:45,919
ship

534
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,120
and it's uh gonna be named

535
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,200
ms satoshi and bitcoin will be accepted

536
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,760

definitely want you guys

541
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,960
the crypto folks we want you to bring

542
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,320
your ideas bring your

543
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,110
businesses uh we want um

544
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,640
[Music]

545
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,080
we want this to be a tech incubator hub

546
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,320
for for everything crypto related

547
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,360
uh we want entrepreneurs expats

548
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
uh aquapreneurs people that want to work

549
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,520
on the ocean

550
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,080
um so that's

551
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,039
so yeah we we want you to come down and

552
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:46,159
get things going on next slide

553
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,679
yeah so our idea here is

554
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,480
uh there's 777 cabins we want to fill

555
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,799
those cabins with uh

556
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,120
great minds a digital nomads bring your

557
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,080

office

563
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,840
and uh yeah hopefully we just

564
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,360
bring some of the talented people like

565
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,240
like yourselves

566
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,480
and

567
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,960
our homes the c pods we're making that

568
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,440
high tech we'll try to

569
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,919
co-use as much of the technology between

570
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,200
the two and uh

571
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,640
make this awesome it's going to be a 30

572
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,200
minute

573
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
boat ride from panama city so you'll be

574
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,320
able to fly your airplane

575
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,760
in the international airport

576

578
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,360
30 minutes so we definitely

579
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,700
are excited about this

580
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,039
[Music]

will be auctioned off so we

597
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,240
look forward to having a whole lot of

598
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,880

and that's oh there's one one more thing

603
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,640
hcpp website and the uh

604
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,760
mission for the conference says it is up

605
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,360
to us to chart new waters draw the maps

606
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,000
tell the stories and build the tools

607
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,440
that will shape our future

608
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,559
for lifetimes to come what better way

609
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,360
to start the new waters than from the

610
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
sea

611
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,279
and be sure to check out the bitcoin

612
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,799
girl um

613
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,130
it's not his new website

614
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,559
[Music]

615
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,480
so we are trying to collect some

616
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
questions so i think there is a

617
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,840
first one

618
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,720
um so regarding your the floating

619
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,120
pods near panama like i mean you said

620
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,399
you're talking to the government

621
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,720
but like i mean isn't the panama canal

622
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,039
kind of notorious for cartels running

623
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,760
running everything through that area

624
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,120
you're not worried about being kind of

625
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,440
exposed out in the open beside one of

626
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,720
the biggest drug rates in the world with

627
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,159
no government protection at all

628
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,279
and like have you talked to them

629
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,600
well we we live here in panama we've

630
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,360
been here the past year

631
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,640
um and there's certainly

632
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,919
we won't deny that there's

633
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,240
drugs

634
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,470
nearby everywhere but uh

635
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,549
[Music]

636
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,640
so the uh the marina where the

637
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,679
the houses will be placed are

638
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,799
i mean it's a marina it has security uh

639
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,760
we feel

640
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,120
super safe there it's it's really not

641
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,080
not as crazy drug dealer as you would

642
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,399
think

643
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,679
like it will be everything but uh

644
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,799
i've never seen anything myself but

645
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,679
i don't do drugs so i wouldn't know but

646
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,760
uh no it's we feel safe

647
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,840
um and with the cruise ship uh we'll be

648
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,080
extra safe because nobody can get on

649
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,440
board that's

650
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,679
not not supposed to be on board and

651
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,600
watching everything so it's yeah

652
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
and we're even talk talk about the like

653
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,159
drone

654
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,279
drone cameras that if somebody brings

655
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,159
their boat up to your house then uh

656
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,200
the drone pops up and

657
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,918
checks them out

658
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,360
okay so we're checking any any more

659
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,840
questions here

660
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,760
hi about those ocean homes you're

661
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,120
working on

662
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,760
how do you expect what will be uh

663
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,880
how basically how weather proof uh how

664
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,240
durable the construction

665
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,640
can be

666
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,399
we over in it's gonna be

667
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,120
it's actually a uh we use the same

668
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,480
technology as

669
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,159
uh ships so it's a

670
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,279
um a sandwich

671
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,720
like a fiberglass foam fiberglass

672
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,679
so it's very durable we we wanted to

673
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,799
make it

674
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,919
uh so durable that you know it

675
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,679
could take a shot from a bullet and you

676
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,840
wouldn't even get anything inside

677
00:30:52,399 --> 00:31:05,840
and we were over engineering it all

678
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:19,840
um so the question was answered

679
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,600
the question was in terms of years

680
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,039
how many years how many years no

681
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,360
how many years it can last if you have

682
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,480
any like prediction

683
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,640
like

684
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,840
any boat um we're actually gonna be

685
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,600
flagging them as a houseboat

686
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,240
so they're gonna be you know they're

687
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,480
completely legal to have in the water

688
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,279
um so as long as you know the latest

689
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,799
catamarans or

690
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,760
um actually we're gonna try to try to

691
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,600
make it so that

692
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,000
you know the idea of being like 100

693
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,360
years for the

694
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,720
the house to last um they actually don't

695
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,159
build houses

696
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,720
these days last more than 30 years or

697
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,600
any of the mortgages run out but we're

698
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,480
we're definitely looking long-term if

699
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,399
you have really take good care of the

700
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,919
house or how would we dash last long

701
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,760
okay so you need to take care of the

702
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,519
house yet

703
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,039
last longer so that was question

704
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,840
i just wanted to understand about the he

705
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,760
said it's inside a marina

706
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,120
but could you explain more like it's not

707
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,320
in the ocean then

708
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
did you hear the question right like i

709
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,240
said we're gonna walk

710
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,440
yes we're gonna walk before we run

711
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,279
so um there's there's a

712
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,799
marina there's gonna right past the

713
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,799
anchorage in a little cove

714
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,279
off an island which is well protected

715
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,120
you know highest waves are like half a

716
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,240
meter

717
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,840
so it's uh you'll just be able to take

718
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,880
your dinghy

719
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,960
out from the marina go back to the

720
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,640
marina for you know have a nice

721
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,760
dinner at their restaurant um

722
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,200
it's uh yeah so

723
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,480
we are starting um near shore we call

724
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,320
these the shallow water version because

725
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,519
uh

726
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,080
we're we're starting close to shore just

727
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,720
to get you

728
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,399
people used to the idea of house

729
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,679
um out on the water people people see

730
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,600
our prototypes we have a couple

731
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,559
prototypes in the water and they

732
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,080
they don't understand how it's sitting

733
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,480
in the water so steady and uh

734
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,440
safe so we have to explain that it's you

735
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,000
know

736
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,399
super futuristic rocket technology that

737
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,960
you know you can't understand but

738
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,399
we're trying to get people used to the

739
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,720
concept of these houses

740
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,200
in the water

741
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,200
okay any any more question

742
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,760
so so maybe you were you were kind of uh

743
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,520
answering to the question i have on my

744
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,040
mind because uh

745
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,079
uh i was just all i'm thinking of what's

746
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,199
the capacity

747
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,760
like of the of the cups or the house and

748
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,159
how the socializing works but maybe with

749
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,800
this

750
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,639
marina concept you're starting to answer

751
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,320
to this my question because

752
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,040
you know like i need to socialize that's

753
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,239
what i was on this concert

754
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,199
congress right well there's uh

755
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,079
the area we chose for the first area

756
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,040
will be

757
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,239
hopefully about 30 homes

758
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,440
yeah the right now it has i'd say about

759
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,679
40 40 boats so i mean it's

760
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,599
it's not too that too much different

761
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,839
from the boats that are anchored already

762
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,399
so

763
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,480
any questions you have of you know where

764
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,000
you get water where to get food where

765
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,719
you get everything

766
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,160
i mean those boats are already dealing

767
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,760
that right now

768
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,079
so um it's it's all pretty

769
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,440
straightforward people are already

770
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,359
living it so we're not

771
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,720
we're not doing anything super difficult

772
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,240
as far as living goes

773
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,040
um it's just a new new process of

774
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,359
manufacturing

775
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,680
we gotta get those down and then

776
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,359
hopefully we'll have these homes all

777
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,960
over the world

778
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,400
more technology more stable so compared

779
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,359
to when you

780
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,440
take the boat sailboat outside in the

781
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,040
open ocean and

782
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,400
you know they are always going to be

783
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,640
like this is coming

784
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,599
but our home is going to stay like

785
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,800
always

786
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,040
it's more stable so you can feel the

787
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,480
difference between the

788
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,920
houseboat wind park uh on the open ocean

789
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,640
and

790
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,400
the boat the sailboat when you park on

791
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,680
the opening

792
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,560
it's very beautiful

793
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,440
so basically answer my next question

794
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,800
because besides

795
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,520
socializing was my next question

796
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,720
seasickness

797
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,119
but you exactly was answering the

798
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,160
answering this so

799
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,040
so maybe maybe uh i i would like to ask

800
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,400
about the cruise ship

801
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,640
because it was not for cleve for me so

802
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,480
it means that what you offer is kind of

803
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:10,880
the

804
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,680
ownerships of the cabins and does it

805
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,839
work on some kind of timeshare system or

806
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,040
just like one

807
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,400
ownership cabin like

808
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,040
uh you can buy the buy the cabin

809
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,839
outright um

810
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,160
you will have a managed

811
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,800
property management service if you want

812
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,280
to use that either to rent it to uh

813
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,200
people long term or um for tourists

814
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,920
so uh a cruise ship is like a little

815
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,440
village so we want this to be like a

816
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,480
petri dish of

817
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,640
um you know crypto folk have so many

818
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,079
ideas of

819
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,720
how you can run things with crypto but

820
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,240
there's never been like a

821
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,800
a bitcoin city or a crypto city that you

822
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,320
can

823
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,800
try out you know having everything built

824
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,560
interfe there's gonna be a lot of new

825
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,960
experiments going on so uh i hope you

826
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,320
enjoy

827
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,880
technology enough to be able to put up

828
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,320
it's not gonna be

829
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,000
um we're not targeting the 80 year old

830
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,079
retiree that just wants to have a simple

831
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,280
life because

832
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,800
they're going to have this new

833
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,640
newfangled computers in their hands or

834
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,400
whatever all the time like oh what's

835
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,680
what's this button do

836
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,200
so it's going to be constantly evolving

837
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,920
be something you can try out your your

838
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,040
own uh

839
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,000
crypto systems on board and i hope we we

840
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,280
become like the

841
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,480
place to try everything out yeah it's

842
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,320
like you walk into the mall you have

843
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,880
everything

844
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,000
inside if you take picture until

845
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,200
like oh i can go over there shopping i

846
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,240
can do my hair

847
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,320
my journey my uh

848
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,040
my everything that you need to do there

849
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,960
all the business that we need to get

850
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,560
into the boat and we are looking forward

851
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,079
to open this

852
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,440
you can also buy the room

853
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,079
when it out or you can sell it later

854
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,839
when you don't need it

855
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,680
and you can live there

856
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,400
working just yeah we want to get the

857
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,280
cabins

858
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,599
cheap enough and that's that's why we

859
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,880
waited for

860
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,720
you know the prices to come down on

861
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,400
cruise ships before we're

862
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,119
willing to do that because we want i

863
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,800
wanted to be cheap enough where somebody

864
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,280
can

865
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,920
can throw down a couple bitcoin and say

866
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,800
okay i'm

867
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,520
i'm just gonna move the panel on you

868
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,160
know

869
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,400
get rid of all my all my junk at home

870
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,160
and

871
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,280
start a new life okay so we have one

872
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,480
more question here maybe the last one

873
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,480
uh so for the cruise uh

874
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,960
what who is going to make like the rules

875
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,119
or the laws inside the crew since there

876
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:01,839
is no

877
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,480
government and will you have like a

878
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,839
contract that people

879
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,040
sign agreeing with the laws and

880
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,839
how is it going to be

881
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,400
right yeah definitely um and that's one

882
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,440
of those things that

883
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,720
i think governance is something

884
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,560
we can we can evolve um uh this is more

885
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,599
like a

886
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,200
condo um

887
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,440
association so i mean we're you're still

888
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,960
under

889
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,119
um any extreme thing like murder or

890
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,359
anything you're under panama law so

891
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,000
there's a serious crime we can um

892
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,680
you know go to panama panama is very

893
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,079
flexible their

894
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,200
residency program we're actually selling

895
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,760
with each room of an extra five thousand

896
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,800
dollars

897
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,040
uh you can get your residency in panama

898
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,280
so and in five years you can get

899
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,720
a second citizenship so as far as as

900
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,560
well contract of course and

901
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,920
um we hope that the the residents

902
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,560
will be able to do their own voting and

903
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,280
uh

904
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,000
you know kind of leave it to them to

905
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,119
evolve

906
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,160
uh the governance of the thing as

907
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,839
as they see fit

908
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,960
yeah fortunately um the nice thing about

909
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,359
being

910
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,760
on the cruise ship or being on a boat at

911
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,720
all is

912
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,000
once you step off land um

913
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,200
things get a bit more uh flexible as far

914
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,079
as

915
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,200
legality goes so um

916
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,480
a lot of stuff that um

917
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,400
like labor law and stuff like that

918
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,200
that's enforced in

919
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,240
in um on land

920
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,599
um they have different label labor laws

921
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,440
more more um flexible on the ship

922
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,200
so it'll be it'll be a lot better out on

923
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,680
out on the water than it is just going

924
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,560
30 minutes to

925
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,040
the city

926
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,319
i mean how

927
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,400
yeah no no cool required you can

928
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,720
go talk to people without

929
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,160
a mask in front of your face

930
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,960

um that's that's something

950
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,640
there's some governance structure that

951
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,599
people can vote and

952
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,420
control all that themselves and

953
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,240
