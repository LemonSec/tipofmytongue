00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,000
so thanks everyone for having me

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,080
um i'm going to talk a little bit today

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,040
about uh

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,759
privacy enhancing currencies and supply

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,839
auditability

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,440
so for those that don't know i'm ricardo

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,640
spani you may know me as fluffy pony

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,279
there is my gpg key that's you know i

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,880
mean you've got to have your gpg key at

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,080
the beginning of any serious

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,439
presentation

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,279
i was the lead maintainer on the monero

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,480
core protocol

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,040
for many years and stepped down last

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,600
year

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
so now i'm no longer lead maintainer i'm

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,640
just a maintainer

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,399
i'm still heavily involved with monero

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,640
but i spend a lot of time

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,600
working on tari and i co-founded atari

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,280
labs in order to build that

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
so today we're going to talk about what

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,120
the actual issue is when it comes to

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,719
supply auditability

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,000
what the options are and the trade-offs

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,199
and where does this actually leave us so

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,160
to start

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,320
um let's talk a little bit about what

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,760
the issue is

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,640
now as you know bitcoin is the gold

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,600
standard

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,479
in very many ways um especially when it

34
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,320
comes to supply auditability because you

35
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,360
can see

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
the amounts being transacted and for

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,560
many people

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
that is something that they actually

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
want um

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,320
privacy enhancing cryptocurrencies like

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,799
monero obscure or hide the amounts using

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,320
various methods

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
and this is there to the criticism that

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
uh there could be hidden inflation risk

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,159
or there is hidden inflation risk that's

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,119
associated

47
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,479
with any privacy enhancing currency and

48
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,439
you know it's not a not an invalid um

49
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,079
claim

50
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,520
but there's a lot more nuance to it so

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,799
um when it comes to this a lot of people

52
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,560
say that the reason that bitcoin doesn't

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,479
have this problem is because i can see

54
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,439
the amounts

55
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,000
and i can use a calculator but that's a

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
terrible baseline for auditability i

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,759
mean think about it

58
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,320
if the baseline for us trusting any sort

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
of cryptographic system is

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
i can see the amounts and use a

61
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
calculator well then we shouldn't be

62
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
using hashes

63
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,880
we shouldn't be using private public key

64
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
cryptography we shouldn't be using

65
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,160
anything that

66
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
is maybe a little bit outside of our

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
realm of understanding

68
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,160
and let's be honest like we rely on all

69
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,000
sorts of things all sorts of math that

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
we do mathematics that we don't

71
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,080
understand

72
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,920
all sorts of cryptography that we don't

73
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,560
understand because we trust not only

74
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,959
in the actual science behind it but we

75
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,959
trust in the implementation as well

76
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,599
so if if we're going to really dig into

77
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,840
this issue because let's be clear

78
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,800
we do want soundness we want soundness

79
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,040
in our monetary system

80
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
but we need to understand what are the

81
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
trade-offs what are the

82
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,519
the actual problems that could arise

83
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,160
so when it comes to when it comes to the

84
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,920
supply auditability issue there really

85
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,200
are three problems that

86
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,440
can arise the first is you could have a

87
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,360
cryptographic hardness assumption

88
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,560
that breaks the second is they could be

89
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
detectable inflation due to an

90
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,840
implementation flaw

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
and the third is they could be

92
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,959
undetectable inflation due to an

93
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,640
implementation flaw

94
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,879
so let's dig into these one at a time to

95
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,800
really understand them firstly

96
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
a cryptographic hardness assumption

97
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,959
breaks what does that actually mean

98
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,400
well we rely on certain assumptions

99
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
like the discrete logarithm problem when

100
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,400
it comes to designing cryptographic

101
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,599
systems

102
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,000
and obviously if a cryptographic

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
hardness assumption were to be broken by

104
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,640
the existence of something like

105
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,879
some sort of quantum computer the

106
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
sufficient qubits and

107
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
you know some hypothetical future where

108
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,560
we're able to like extract

109
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,799
energy from the core of the sun or you

110
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,840
know all of these other

111
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,080
things that that that could possibly

112
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,879
break

113
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,879
um some of these assumptions in that

114
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,040
world in this future

115
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,000
where this is broken then an attacker

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,239
could use this cryptographic break

117
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,599
to print an infinite amount of monero

118
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,480
cool we understand the problem the issue

119
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,040
here

120
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,439
is if something like the discrete

121
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,799
logarithm

122
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,200
problem if that assumption is broken we

123
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,080
have

124
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,799
much bigger problems like everything's

125
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,280
broken

126
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,959
you know i mean then we we might as well

127
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,560
just go back to like pen and paper and

128
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,720
like sending letters around because

129
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,320
you know communication systems are

130
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,079
disrupted um

131
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
bitcoin's in trouble manero is in

132
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
trouble you know

133
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,240
uh everything's in trouble you know your

134
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,759
websites are not going to work because

135
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,199
tls is broken

136
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,720
so the reality is typically when it

137
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
comes to cryptographic hardness

138
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,000
assumptions breaking

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
i like to think that that's not really

140
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,520
something that we need to worry

141
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,160
ourselves

142
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,080
with the risk is cryptographically

143
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,479
negligible and frankly by the time

144
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,280
something like

145
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,440
um the discrete logarithm problem is

146
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,680
challenged genuinely challenged

147
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,199
we should be on to some other

148
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,800
cryptographic system

149
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
maybe a post-quantum system or something

150
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,960
that's got other hardness assumptions

151
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
which we hope won't be broken for you

152
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,520
know at least a couple of years

153
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,759
so the second one detectable inflation

154
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,080
due to an implementation flaw

155
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
now the thing is this is really i mean

156
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
you can see that the two and three are

157
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,320
due to implementation flaws and this is

158
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,160
really where the issue lies because

159
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
you can have the best cryptography

160
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
uh designed by the smartest

161
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
cryptographers in the world

162
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,160
reviewed by thousands of researchers all

163
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,199
over the world

164
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,440
and then the person implementing it like

165
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
they make

166
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
taking the implementation and that floor

167
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,039
can be exploited

168
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,560
so this is a this is a lot more

169
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,720
realistic right okay

170
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,039
so here's the thing with detectable

171
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:39,919
inflation

172
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,720
um it's happened before it's happened

173
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,080
several times

174
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,520
it's happened with bitcoin and it's

175
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,600
happened with monero it's happened twice

176
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
with bitcoin it happened in

177
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,039
august 2010 with bitcoin's value

178
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,160
overflow bug

179
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
it happened again more recently uh with

180
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,199
bitcoin's output double spend bug

181
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,440
and it happened with monero's key image

182
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,840
malleability bug in 2017

183
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,160
okay and in all three of these instances

184
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,680
it was detected

185
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,720
and it was handled safely now

186
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,360
how well with bitcoin's value overflow

187
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,199
bug there was a soft fork to say

188
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,280
hey these outputs that created billions

189
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,199
and billions and billions of bitcoin

190
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,400
they're invalid outputs and so and uh

191
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,919
there were sort of two chains that

192
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,440
existed simultaneously

193
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,800
and the ones with the billions and

194
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
billions and billions of bitcoin

195
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
eventually fell by the wayside and a

196
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,800
much longer

197
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,199
or much stronger chain was created and

198
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,440
that's the one that we use today

199
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
bitcoin bitcoin's output double spend

200
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,199
bug and also monero's key image

201
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,479
malleability bug

202
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,319
were sort of surreptitiously or

203
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,479
discreetly fixed so there was

204
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,080
effects that was pushed out without

205
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,160
making it public the error was

206
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,199
or the bug was picked up internally um

207
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,400
either by bitcoin or

208
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
narrow developers or reported in by

209
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
somebody who found it

210
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
without them going and reporting it

211
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,560
publicly or abusing the bug

212
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,759
so this is great handled safely this is

213
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,319
fantastic it was detected it was handled

214
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,360
here's the issue what happens

215
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
if in all three of these instances in

216
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
any one of them with bitcoin or with

217
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,080
monero

218
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,199
those extra funds that had been created

219
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
were spent so let's say that let's take

220
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,000
bitcoins output double spend by bug

221
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because it's a pretty recent one

222
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
so it gets spent and it gets say

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,639
deposited to an exchange now it gets

224
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,680
detected because

225
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
you know like in some routine check or

226
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,880
whatever

227
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,639
maybe you know using your eyes in a

228
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,120
calculator someone sees that something's

229
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,560
gone wrong

230
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,360
but by the time that detection happens

231
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
it's likely going to be too late

232
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,400
and the reality is no one actually knows

233
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
what to do

234
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
if these funds are spent before

235
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,319
detection there have been

236
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
many discussions about what if what if

237
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,599
what if

238
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,960
in bitcoin and in monero and

239
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,759
the reality is that every single

240
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,639
possible proposal for dealing with this

241
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,199
is ugly it doesn't matter you know

242
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,879
whether it is like let's hard fork it

243
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,479
out that's soft fork it up let's roll

244
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,879
back the chain ethereum style

245
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,879
any proposal for dealing with an

246
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,520
incident of detectable inflation

247
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,919
after it's been spent or after it's been

248
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,199
abused

249
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,120
is likely going to hurt legitimate users

250
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,440
and services and it's likely going to be

251
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,560
catastrophic so think about it imagine a

252
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
scenario where

253
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,159
even a thousand bitcoins created out of

254
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,360
thin air

255
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
and it's now spent it's deposited on

256
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,399
exchange it was

257
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,159
exchanged into ripple and withdrawn

258
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,399
and the ripple community are standing

259
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,080
fast and they don't want to return those

260
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,360
funds

261
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
what do you do the the hardness the

262
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,560
soundness of bitcoin's monetary system

263
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,480
is now threatened by the existence

264
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,600
of these extra coins you can't burn them

265
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
because they've been bought by other

266
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
traders who did not know they were

267
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,720
buying illegitimate coins

268
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
you can't roll back the chain because

269
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,839
that's going to threaten other

270
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,680
transactions

271
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,519
it's really problematic okay

272
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,040
but let's be clear here as long as

273
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,160
uh the risk is found and fixed early

274
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,760
or the bag is found and fixed early we

275
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,360
can consider that risk to be pretty

276
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,920
small

277
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
it's not negligible but you know it's

278
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,519
happened on bitcoin it's happened on

279
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,519
monero so we know it happens

280
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,200
but because of um researchers typically

281
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,440
using reporting systems like um you know

282
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,040
monero uses hacker one and bitcoin also

283
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,880
has their own reporting system

284
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,000
because of things like that researchers

285
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,959
tend to go

286
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,000
and report bugs without abusing them or

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
before they abuse them

288
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,519
and that's great i you know that's that

289
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,640
is fantastic it really reduces this risk

290
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,959
and i think also another aspect of this

291
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,640
is most attackers know

292
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,440
that if they abuse this they might get

293
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,480
away with it

294
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,320
and they might be able to take some

295
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,240
profit in their creation of this

296
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,360
uh infinite mint or this uh this break

297
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,279
and supply auditability

298
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,279
but they will probably destroy the

299
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,880
entire cryptographic system and in the

300
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,480
case of bitcoin

301
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
they'll probably take the entire

302
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,920
cryptocurrency ecosystem down with them

303
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,600
so that's just like

304
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,880
not great you know i mean that is a

305
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,959
situation that you really do not want to

306
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,240
have play out

307
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
um you know everyone loses and i think

308
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
attackers know this so

309
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
we can consider this risk to be pretty

310
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,800
small the last one is undetectable

311
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
inflation due to an implementation flaw

312
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,839
now let's be clear here this is a

313
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,519
special class of attack

314
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,440
that exclusively affects privacy

315
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,360
enhancing currencies

316
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
as we know you know bitcoin doesn't

317
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,560
really have to worry about this because

318
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,519
you can use your eyes in the calculator

319
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,800
now the thing with this is again

320
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
there are no good ways of handling this

321
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,839
you have exactly the same problem

322
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:56,480
because

323
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,600
you know maybe you never detect it and

324
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
then the person's gotten away with

325
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
printing

326
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,040
you know free money and maybe you detect

327
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,959
it in the future through something like

328
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,680
a turnstile the problem with proposals

329
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
like turnstiles is they don't really

330
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,600
work

331
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
they just give an attacker this game

332
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,640
theoretic advantage now

333
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,240
let me explain how turnstile is supposed

334
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
to work so imagine

335
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,440
you have a day and leading up to that

336
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
day so this is a special date first of

337
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,959
january 2021

338
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,120
leading up to that date everyone that

339
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,000
uses monero

340
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,640
needs to reveal the amounts on chain

341
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,839
they don't need to reveal who they are

342
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,240
but they need to reveal their amounts

343
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,320
and if during the reveal of these

344
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,440
amounts

345
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
we discover that that they

346
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
cryptographically reveal

347
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,279
more than should exist well then we have

348
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,640
a problem

349
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,040
and once they once we hit that turnstile

350
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
once we we hit that point where

351
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,920
there's too many coins then should that

352
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,040
should ex or then

353
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
should exist well then we're just going

354
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,560
to reject anything else that's trying to

355
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,480
reveal its amounts and only people

356
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,079
who reveal their amounts up to that

357
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,680
point will get to keep their coins

358
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,519
that's effectively the way a turnstile

359
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,519
works the problem with this is that it

360
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,279
can be abused in a number of ways

361
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,000
for example an attacker who has printed

362
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,120
infinite money

363
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,279
can just go and reveal all his outputs

364
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,240
very early

365
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
in the turnstile and all the people who

366
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,560
are late who reveal it much later down

367
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,279
the road

368
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,040
are the ones that end up getting well

369
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,480
they end up losing right because now

370
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,000
their coins are unspendable

371
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,240
and the attacker wins the other thing

372
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,839
that an attacker could do

373
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,079
um is again just from a game theoretic

374
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,120
perspective

375
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,680
uh he could encourage people to enter

376
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,040
some sort of

377
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,680
you know sort of mixing pool or

378
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,079
something

379
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,399
like that to gain some sort of privacy

380
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,760
advantage and then

381
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,639
as they enter he can leave and go after

382
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,760
the turnstile

383
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,440
and get coins to spend and then when

384
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,279
eventually those people go like

385
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,040
oh it's you know now time for me to pull

386
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,560
out of this mixing pool

387
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,519
well you know too late like their coins

388
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,120
become expendable because they've

389
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,240
tripped the turn style

390
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,040
so turn styles are just not great um

391
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,639
they give the attacker all sorts of game

392
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,920
theoretic advantages

393
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,240
they don't actually solve the problem so

394
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,079
frankly this issue

395
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,800
is the real trade-off because in that

396
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,839
event

397
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,880
that's really the real problem

398
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,240
that can't you know where it's

399
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,560
undetectable that can't be fixed in an

400
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,079
easy way

401
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,079
that if it is eventually detected or if

402
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,480
there is some methodology for detecting

403
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,880
it

404
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,839
it like ends up hurting legitimate users

405
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,200
that's the real trade-off

406
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
and again don't get me wrong the risk is

407
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,440
what i would consider to be quite small

408
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,079
for the same

409
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,880
reasons um that the detectable inflation

410
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,920
risk is small

411
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,120
but the risk does exist so where does

412
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,920
this leave us

413
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,160
you know like what like knowing all of

414
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,560
this where do we actually stand

415
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,920
okay so both non-private and private

416
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
currencies face many of the same supply

417
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,519
auditability risks

418
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,240
for example um cryptographic hardness

419
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,199
assumptions

420
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,240
we rely on it whether it is bitcoin

421
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,519
monero or any other

422
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,000
cryptocurrency any other cryptographic

423
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,560
system

424
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
we rely on these cryptographic hardness

425
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
assumptions and if they are broken

426
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,360
well we're in much larger trouble then

427
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,399
uh you know

428
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,480
an attacker can print infinite monero or

429
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
infinite bitcoin

430
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,639
at the same time if you consider things

431
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,959
like a detectable inflation attack

432
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,800
that would be devastating as well right

433
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,880
because there's no great way to

434
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,040
to fix it and this i'm assuming you know

435
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
a detectable inflation attack that's

436
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,000
already occurred

437
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
has already been exploited and the funds

438
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,639
have already been sent elsewhere

439
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,959
and so in view of that we can conclude

440
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,120
that a privacy enhancing currency

441
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
carries the very real risk of

442
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
undetectable inflation

443
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,959
but it gives you powerful privacy great

444
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,079
on the other hand a non-private currency

445
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,839
doesn't come with guarantees for supply

446
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,920
auditability because we've seen with

447
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
bitcoin already it's been exploited at

448
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,720
least twice

449
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,279
or you know it has been exploited twice

450
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,279
um and the supply auditability

451
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
uh assumption has been broken um but

452
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,560
in non-private currencies it makes

453
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
privacy much harder to achieve

454
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,839
now i want to be clear here i am not

455
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,720
suggesting

456
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,440
at all that this is now a bitcoin versus

457
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,399
monero debate or anything like that

458
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,839
i just think it's important to

459
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,720
understand the trade-offs and the reason

460
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,680
that i'm doing this

461
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,160
isn't because i think monero is better

462
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,199
than bitcoin

463
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,959
it's because i think privacy is coming

464
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,639
to bitcoin whether it is

465
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,360
layer 2 privacy um whether it is through

466
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,120
the excellent work of projects like

467
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,800
samurai wallet

468
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,480
whether it's through snore signatures i

469
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,320
think stronger privacy is coming to

470
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,279
bitcoin

471
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,440
and what i want to fight against and

472
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,959
what i what i think we should fight

473
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:47,839
against

474
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,440
is the view that i've heard from a lot

475
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,279
of people that privacy shouldn't come to

476
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,399
bitcoin

477
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,800
bitcoin should never enhance its privacy

478
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
because that could somehow compromise

479
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
supply auditability

480
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,160
and i think that that's a bad assumption

481
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,079
because supply auditability is not

482
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,440
guaranteed

483
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,079
in bitcoin right now and if it is broken

484
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,880
in future

485
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,279
again through something like the ability

486
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,759
to double spend a transaction output

487
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,399
by the time that is detected it could be

488
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,920
that an attacker's already

489
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,759
already done the initial spend and then

490
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,440
when the legitimate user comes along and

491
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,720
they want to actually spend their

492
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
transaction output that's the double

493
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,440
spend

494
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
and then it's too late then the the

495
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,759
supply auditability is wrecked because

496
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,360
that spend that initial spend from the

497
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,079
attacker

498
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,639
could be from months ago so there are no

499
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,399
supply auditability guarantees with

500
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:34,959
bitcoin

501
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,120
anyway at least not not any that we

502
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,560
really care about

503
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,680
and frankly i think that

504
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,639
the fact that you have this this pretend

505
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,639
supply auditability gain

506
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,240
by having all the amounts visible and

507
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,320
you can whip out your texas instruments

508
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,600
pocket calculator

509
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,720
and add things up is just

510
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,399
not not the way that we really should be

511
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,680
dealing with things when it comes to

512
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,880
trade-offs because it's not a real

513
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,560
supply auditability gain

514
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,199
and it just makes privacy that much

515
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,359
harder to achieve

516
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,480
now what about in the future well in the

517
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,039
future

518
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,039
like i said there are improvements that

519
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,199
are possible like a non-private currency

520
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,039
uh like bitcoin might give you

521
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,400
sufficient privacy through

522
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,640
level two systems like lightning i'm

523
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,919
hoping that there will be

524
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,480
this addition of uh on chain privacy of

525
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,599
some sort

526
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,679
and i'm hoping that the uh supply

527
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,280
auditability thing

528
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,480
um of bitcoin becomes less or viewed as

529
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,919
less important and the trade-offs are

530
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,320
properly understood similarly a private

531
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,919
currency like monero

532
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,600
might dramatically reduce some of the

533
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
risk for example

534
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
uh right now manero uses peterson

535
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,400
commitments

536
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,600
to hide the transaction amounts we could

537
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,120
switch to elgamal commitments

538
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,200
there are some problems with that for uh

539
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
mostly around the size

540
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
algal commitments have massive range

541
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,240
proofs

542
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,360
but they are computationally hiding

543
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,440
and perfectly binding whereas psn

544
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
commitments are the opposite they are

545
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
computationally binding but perfectly

546
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,000
hiding at the moment we've chosen

547
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,080
the one route because they're smaller

548
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,160
and you can use bullet proofs to even

549
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,840
mass further massively reduce range

550
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,520
proofs but

551
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,840
who knows in the future where bandwidth

552
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,679
is you know nearly unlimited

553
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,080
and uh bandwidth latency is extremely

554
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,720
low

555
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,480
there might be another design constraint

556
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,080
or this might be a design constraint

557
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,200
that's revisited

558
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
and it might be like okay well maybe we

559
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
want to switch to something that is

560
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,960
you know sort of leans a little bit more

561
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,880
in the other way and in fact grin

562
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,320
already has something in place called

563
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,520
switch commitments

564
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
where they are able to make the switch

565
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,039
from peterson to elgamal

566
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,760
uh at in the future so to recap

567
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
everything has unavoidable trade-offs

568
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,880
and comes with

569
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,919
precious few guarantees if any it's

570
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,400
important for each of you individually

571
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
to choose the set of trade-offs that

572
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,880
makes the most sense for you

573
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
for some people and i think this is true

574
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
of many people at the conference and

575
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,160
many people watching

576
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,320
that means choosing a privacy enhancing

577
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,360
currency

578
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,240
and accepting the small risk that they

579
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,799
could be

580
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,679
undetectable inflation in future for

581
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,880
others

582
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,919
they are not prepared to accept that and

583
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,679
they want to be able to pull out their

584
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
texas instruments pocket calculator and

585
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,720
add up amounts

586
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
on a block explorer and that's fine

587
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,520
they'll trust other cryptographic

588
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,280
systems in their cryptocurrency of

589
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,919
choice

590
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,840
but they don't want to trust something

591
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,120
like range proofs

592
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,919
and that's okay i accept that and i

593
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,200
think it's important for each of us

594
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,720
individually to choose which set of

595
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,559
tradeoffs we want

596
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,000
most important stay up to date with

597
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,320
future improvements that goes for

598
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
downloading actual you know software

599
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,000
updates through to seeing what's

600
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
happening

601
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,559
in the landscape in the research

602
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,400
landscape to see what's coming down the

603
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,919
pipeline because maybe the set of

604
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,840
trade-offs that you've decided on

605
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
might be good well suited to you for you

606
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,080
today but as new research is published

607
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
you might decide that another set of

608
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,320
trade-offs makes a lot more sense

609
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,679
so i hope that i've given you some

610
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
insight into

611
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,720
supply auditability where the traders

612
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,640
are and what can be done in future

613
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
i thank you very much for your time and

614
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:21,840
i'm happy to take questions

615
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,919
hello hello so there we go can you hear

616
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,600
me can you hear me okay

617
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,000
so uh fluffy bunny thank you a lot for

618
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,720
your

619
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,600
uh really interesting presentation now

620
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,520
it's a question time so i'm going to ask

621
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,039
uh firstly people here physically in

622
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,360
in the institute of crypto anarchy by

623
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,120
the way the room

624
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
he the name of the room or people are

625
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,039
sitting here it's called institute of

626
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,799
crypto anarchy

627
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,320
nice so so any questions okay there is

628
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,799
one question

629
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,559
hello uh i have a question about

630
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,840
the tradeoff between privacy and

631
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
auditability

632
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
i've been told to stand here so you can

633
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
hear me

634
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,720
okay so i was just thinking that uh of

635
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,440
course

636
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,960
that fiat for example has very low

637
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,280
audit ability and that's like

638
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,080
that's what made me think that maybe the

639
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,640
trade-off

640
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
is not maybe the trade-off between

641
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,720
privacy and auditability is not so

642
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,840
important as

643
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,039
just the fact that you

644
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,159
just admitted that the order

645
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,000
that it's more possible than

646
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,120
some people think to reduce the

647
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,880
auditability of some

648
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,720
currencies therefore like isn't

649
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,720
isn't it like no

650
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
no compromise argument for some people

651
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,000
to just know

652
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,080
not use anything if you can't ensure

653
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,880
that

654
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,919
actually there might be some

655
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,840
as you said undiscoverable inflations

656
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
yeah i think that for some some people

657
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,679
certainly um

658
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,520
some people certainly make that argument

659
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
you know they they make the argument

660
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,520
that they

661
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,400
that their particular set of trade-offs

662
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,280
is

663
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,159
to make sure that there is absolutely no

664
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,280
risk to their monetary system at all

665
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
i think it's it's pretty clear now that

666
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,600
that even a

667
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
sound monetary system a hard money

668
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,679
system like bitcoin

669
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,840
could have um supply auditability

670
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,679
problems and in fact has had

671
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,840
supply audit auditability problems in

672
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,720
the past

673
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
so i think it's important to understand

674
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
that when you know when people say oh

675
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,360
hey listen

676
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,600
you know i i this is my requirement i

677
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,559
need hard money

678
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,440
i need um total supply auditability that

679
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,480
it's important that they

680
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,720
understand what that actually means that

681
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,799
they're not getting that with bitcoin

682
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,799
um they're not getting that with

683
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,159
traceable currencies at

684
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,559
all they're definitely getting

685
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,840
self-sovereignty they're definitely

686
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,600
getting all sorts of other benefits

687
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,280
but i think it's important that we not

688
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,000
pretend that supply auditability issues

689
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,280
cannot exist

690
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,200
just because amounts are visible

691
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,440
okay thanks a lot some other questions

692
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,039
okay maybe maybe online

693
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,240
so okay

694
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,120
so there's one question okay wait a

695
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
moment

696
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,600
uh okay

697
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,559
okay so so the question is do you think

698
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,200
an assets use primarily as a store of

699
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,240
value

700
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,840
which is like a bit concurrent

701
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,039
trajectory or method of exchange

702
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,480
monero cr monitors current trajectory

703
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,360
change the priorities for privacy versus

704
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,640
easy

705
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,679
auditability that's la that's last

706
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,279
question

707
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,679
that's a good question um yeah that

708
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,240
that's a hard one i think that

709
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,000
um you know if we consider that bitcoin

710
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
is made or maybe operates like gold um

711
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,760
like

712
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,440
the digital form of gold because that's

713
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,200
a store of value

714
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,000
then uh your own personal supply

715
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,960
auditability

716
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,799
is probably important the fact that you

717
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,559
can validate how much gold you've got in

718
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,200
your safe

719
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,720
is important whether you can validate um

720
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,640
on an individual basis how much gold

721
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
exists in the world probably isn't that

722
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,679
important

723
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,720
so i i tend to i tend to think that

724
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
um you know if we view store of value

725
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,880
as a as an attractive quality

726
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,039
or as a quality to pursue in something

727
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,320
like bitcoin

728
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
that shouldn't mean that it has to

729
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,000
compromise on privacy

730
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
i'm a proponent for bitcoin adding

731
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,840
privacy if that's not clear already

732
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,880
um and i think that it is it's it's a

733
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,919
great idea

734
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,159
to not compromise on privacy just

735
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,039
because

736
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,960
we think that as a store of value it

737
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,640
needs to have this traceable quality it

738
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,400
needs to have some sort of magical

739
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
supply auditability quality which

740
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,600
frankly doesn't exist

741
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,240
so trajectory matters in in one way but

742
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,159
does that trajectory mean that you

743
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,760
should compromise in privacy i don't

744
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,559
think so

745
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,720
i mean you're not obligated to store

746
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
your your physical gold

747
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,960
in like you know in front of a window in

748
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,559
a glass cage

749
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,480
you're totally able to store your gold

750
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,240
in a safe and no one knows how much gold

751
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,039
you've got

752
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,279
and so it should be the same for for

753
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,880
bitcoin or for any currency for any

754
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,799
digital currency

755
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,760
okay so we have another question from uh

756
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,600
my fred krypton orchestra from

757
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,880
bratislava

758
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,200
so what is the current main drawback

759
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,000
that

760
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,320
is holding monroe back against other

761
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,799
medium of exchange

762
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,520
oh sure do we have time for another 30

763
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,158
minutes um

764
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,799
i could talk about monero's drawbacks

765
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,640
for for ages because i think it's

766
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,679
important to

767
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,279
to acknowledge um monero's drawbacks

768
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,440
um so there are several and and i think

769
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,200
that some of the main ones

770
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,880
are monero is very chunky

771
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,840
when it comes to things like being able

772
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,679
to run a lightweight wallet being able

773
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,120
to sync up a node

774
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,600
it's not ethereum chunky but it's still

775
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,159
chunky

776
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,400
and even with monero's pruning you don't

777
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,279
get to prune

778
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,440
as much as you do on something like

779
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
bitcoin

780
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,360
very early on we did actually get monero

781
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,520
nodes syncing up on raspberry pi's and

782
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,559
that sort of thing

783
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,520
quite easily and comfortably nowadays

784
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,720
it's a lot harder

785
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,320
you know you you need to have a little

786
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,760
bit more power

787
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,200
under the hood in order to sync up a

788
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,520
mineral node you need to have you know

789
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,120
a little bit more uh disk speed than an

790
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,760
sd card is going to give you um and and

791
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,279
that's not to say that um

792
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,039
that it isn't a goal to keep monero as

793
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,480
lightweight as possible

794
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,279
it's just you know these trade-offs have

795
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,320
led to

796
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,760
something that is slower and and heavier

797
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,080
in some ways um from a technology

798
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,679
perspective than uh something like

799
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,640
bitcoin

800
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,480
another drawback and this is a big one

801
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,559
and frankly this this applies to bitcoin

802
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,399
as well but it applies especially to

803
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,360
monero

804
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,520
is monero's user experience is

805
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,960
incredibly poor

806
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,799
now there's a lot of work being put into

807
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,640
improving that there are lots of people

808
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,440
that are working

809
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,760
on new wallets like feather wallet that

810
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,880
just got released

811
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,200
um improvements to monero's core gui

812
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,039
there's lots of effort being put into it

813
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,240
but frankly

814
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,880
um if you think about it in the timeline

815
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,679
bitcoin

816
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,960
is over a decade old and only now is

817
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
usability starting to get to the point

818
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,760
where

819
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,960
a normal person can even think about

820
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,000
using bitcoin

821
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,159
in a non-custodial fashion not just

822
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,000
leaving their coins on coinbase

823
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,640
monero's a lot younger monero is barely

824
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,520
six years old and it's got a long way to

825
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:17,840
go

826
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,320
at least another four years in my mind

827
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,240
of development whether that gets crammed

828
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,840
down into less time or not

829
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,360
there's still a lot of development that

830
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,200
needs to be done software development

831
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,000
user experience user testing and

832
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
cryptography and research

833
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,279
on the cryptography and research side of

834
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,520
things in order to get monero to a point

835
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,200
where we can really say the user

836
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,000
experience

837
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,720
is acceptable for non-crypto people or

838
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,600
people who are not

839
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,520
heavily in this and i'll use one example

840
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,880
i don't want to i really don't want to

841
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,320
spend 30 minutes on this

842
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,279
um but one example is monero's addresses

843
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,159
96

844
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,039
plus characters you know you can you can

845
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,520
hide that in a qr code that's great

846
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
but at the end of the day it's still a

847
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,559
chunky thing

848
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,360
it's chunky compared to bitcoin which is

849
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,679
you know relatively short addresses

850
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,679
um and it does scare people when they're

851
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,679
like oh do i need to check every

852
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,840
character in this 96 character long

853
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,640
address

854
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,720
it's frightening again there's work

855
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,320
being done to improve that don't get me

856
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,960
wrong

857
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,279
but it is something that uh that i do

858
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,640
think holds monero back

859
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,399
because it's a little bit frightening

860
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,240
frankly lightning has some of the same

861
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,000
problems you know a lightning invoice

862
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,279
there's also this like

863
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,760
massive set of characters and qr codes

864
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,120
do help

865
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,640
but i think that people have gotten used

866
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,240
to things like tap and pay

867
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,559
and until we have tap and pay systems

868
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,480
for lightning and for monero

869
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,320
i think both are going to be held back

870
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,600
by user experience

871
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,559
issues and a lot of the lack of a lot of

872
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,240
usability stuff like that

873
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,240
when it comes to making easy payments

874
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
thanks before i'm going to ask you the

875
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,600
next question

876
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,240
i just want to ask you uh did you watch

877
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,039
did you watch

878
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,440
the recent presentation from from david

879
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,240
friedman

880
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,080
he had before you yes i did okay because

881
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,640
uh he was criticizing uh bitcoin just

882
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,200
because of

883
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,600
lack of privacy you know so and it was

884
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,440
definitely like an extra argument for

885
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
uh cryptocurrencies like a truly animus

886
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,520
cryptocurrency like like monroe

887
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,559
so so so we have another question

888
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,840
uh so what are you most uh

889
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,440
excited about that's currently being

890
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,279
built research for moneta

891
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,039
great question so obviously i'm excited

892
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,399
for tari which

893
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,720
is being architect always being built as

894
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,399
a merge mind side chain

895
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,480
but more than that i think two big

896
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,000
things that i'm really excited

897
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,360
or three big things that i'm really

898
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,919
excited to see on monero the first

899
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,960
is um a uh

900
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,559
the work is being done on post quantum

901
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,559
cryptography um i think post quantum

902
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,080
research for manero is

903
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,399
is pretty exciting the second thing is

904
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,000
the work that's being done on triptych

905
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and and how that will affect an

906
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,159
improvement area's privacy

907
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,840
and the third thing are atomic swaps and

908
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,519
the research and and effort that's being

909
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,720
done

910
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,760
on atomic swaps for monero

911
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,200
yeah uh like a few days ago i i saw

912
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
some article about atomic swaps atomic

913
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,320
flaps uh between mono and particle

914
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,720
yeah so there's a lot of work being done

915
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,399
on it it's it's fantastic

916
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,320
yeah it's cool because i invested in

917
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,399
particle and still it doesn't have any

918
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,719
value

919
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,679
okay so another question is a feeder

920
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,600
wallet released already i cannot find it

921
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,519
online

922
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,600
uh yeah they posted um yesterday on the

923
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,519
monero subreddit i believe the alpha is

924
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,720
coming october 10th

925
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,279
um which is also my wedding anniversary

926
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:39,760
um

927
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,159
and uh there's a feather wallet

928
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,240
subreddit already that's been created so

929
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,360
i'd suggest um checking uh the feather

930
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,840
water

931
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,720
there feather wallet subreddit for

932
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,240
updates

933
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,640
okay thanks a lot uh i'm going to ask

934
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,760
any other questions

935
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,080
from the physical audience okay any

936
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,519
online question

937
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,200
okay so in that situation oh

938
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,159
okay okay so so another question what

939
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,679
are you most excited about that's

940
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,600
currently being built research for price

941
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,640
on bitcoin so not mono but bitcoin

942
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,519
sure cool um yeah so so quite honestly

943
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,399
and i i'm

944
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,080
i've been very cautious to wade into

945
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,159
this debate um i think that the join

946
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,240
market guys and the wasabi guys

947
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,000
are working really hard and stuff and

948
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,320
that's great but i'm a big samurai

949
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,440
wallet fan

950
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,200
and i know that that might get some hate

951
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,880
from some bitcoiners but i think the

952
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,399
samurai wallet guys

953
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,200
um are doing really good work i just i

954
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
love their attitude in general

955
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,600
um it's it's a little bit it reminds me

956
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
a lot of monero's attitude

957
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,919
um and uh and yeah like just some of the

958
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,039
effort that's gone into

959
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,519
into making samurai wallets uh really

960
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,640
easy to use

961
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,679
i applaud so yeah that's that's sort of

962
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,760
i guess on the bitcoin privacy side what

963
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,000
i'm most excited about right now

964
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,919
um for unchained privacy and then of

965
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,039
course a lot of the stuff that's being

966
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,720
done on lightning i think that

967
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,200
that strong privacy on lightning is

968
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,720
still a while away

969
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,480
um i i probably won't be looking to rely

970
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,039
on lightning from a privacy perspective

971
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,480
for a couple of years still

972
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,559
but i'm very grateful for the effort

973
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,240
that's being oh that's going into it

974
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,440
right now

975
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,880
on the privacy side okay and

976
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,200
it seems this was the last question so

977
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,480
ricardo

978
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,200
