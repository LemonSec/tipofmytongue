1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,200
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,080
sure

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,400
um so yeah today i'm going to be talking

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,120
about

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,440
next generation private multi-signature

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,719
wallets which is a

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,960
terrible name i think for torque sounds

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,400
very boring

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,000
i tried other options like i don't know

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,920
future of bitcoin wallets or

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,439
better tools for better multi-signal

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,519
wallets they they all sounded

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,439
kind of lame to me but really the goal

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,119
of today's talk is just to show

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,119
how new tools that are being developed

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,800
kind of behind the scenes

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
uh are going to really be helpful for

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,880
the next generation of beacon wall that

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,320
are going to eat the market so

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,800
our newer wallets that we'll see in the

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,360
following

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
like couple of years are going to be

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,879
improved thanks to

24
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,520
these new tools that are being developed

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,559
a little bit about me

26
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,800
i generally call myself an independent

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,559
bitcoin developer meaning that i

28
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,879
work full time on bitcoin stuff and i'm

29
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,879
not really like employed by any company

30
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,920
so i generally work

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,199
with sponsorships or grants from other

32
00:00:59,199 --> 00:00:59,920
companies that

33
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,800
allows me to to do this open source

34
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,080
stuff

35
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
i'm currently working on bdk i've been

36
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,439
working on that for the past

37
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,799
like five or six months i would say

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,360
and i'm going to talk about pdk more in

39
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,520
later on in the sol but it's basically

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,439
bdk stands for bitcoin that kit so it's

41
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,360
like a development kit for

42
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,159
um making bitcoin wallets that should be

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,119
fairly easy to

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,680
to use and understand previously i've

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
worked at bhp network which is a

46
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,400
kind of a small consultancy uh based in

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,040
milan

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
consultancy company with milan and block

49
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,040
stream which i think most of you

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,360
know so yeah overview of the talk

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960
the first part is basically like a

52
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,200
description of what type of wallet

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,560
exists today

54
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,399
and they're like trade-offs in general

55
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,479
in terms of security in terms of

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,040
uh also privacy in a way but that's

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,920
gonna be

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,079
uh more we're going to spend more on

59
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,920
that on the later section

60
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,240
um the privacy existing wallet this is

61
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,680
the next section

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
uh that will basically analyze each type

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,880
of wallet and the

64
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,320
characteristics in a way in terms of

65
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
privacy and then

66
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,680
what can we improve today on these

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,639
wallets so what can can we do to

68
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,200
make better wallets with uh the protocol

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,760
the the

70
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,400
bitcoin protocol we have today and then

71
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,840
future bitcoin protocol upgrades that

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,720
can improve that even more so

73
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,680
the first thing is uh just a matter of

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,080
like

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,160
developing of writing code and the other

76
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,599
one is also a bit more like a

77
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,080
controversial social thing in a way

78
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,920
improvements bitcoin are always

79
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
um kind of controversial uh but i'm

80
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,480
gonna just highlight how this can also

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,239
be very helpful for

82
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,360
privacy specifically um so yeah let's

83
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,120
say you are a bitcoin user today

84
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,000
um average non-technical person is very

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,800
likely that you

86
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,160
use a b39 single sig wallet a butadiene

87
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,800
is like the standard for mnemonics so

88
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
the vocabulary of mnemonics and

89
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,319
and how these words are like put

90
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,840
together to to

91
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
at the end derive like a master secret

92
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,319
and you probably have like a mnemonic

93
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,599
written somewhere if you've done

94
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,959
things right the advantage of sync

95
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,400
wallets is that they are very very easy

96
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,519
to use

97
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,280
and also there are like many options to

98
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,720
choose from so this is good because you

99
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
can find the right wallet for you

100
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,519
different wallets they always like take

101
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,319
different

102
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,760
make different choices and they have

103
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,200
different tradeoffs and if you have many

104
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,680
options

105
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
to choose from you can choose the one

106
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,599
that is exactly right for you

107
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,440
and just to name a few in no particular

108
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,120
order i think these are the probably the

109
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,519
most

110
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,080
popular ones uh wasabi samurai electron

111
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,040
these are all

112
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,640
single sea wall there are like ton of

113
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
them i didn't i couldn't mention all of

114
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,680
them here but

115
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
um yeah so now you should ask yourself

116
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,360
how can you lose money with a single sig

117
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,640
wall so this is a very important

118
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,840
question when you

119
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,599
like make a new wallet but not only

120
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,120
between wallets also if you generate

121
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,040
like a new gpg key or

122
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,280
whenever you have to manipulate like

123
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,080
sensitive

124
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,920
secrets you should ask yourself what can

125
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
go wrong and in the case of single sig

126
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,599
wall let's

127
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,879
probably the first thing that comes to

128
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,760
mind is an act device so you have

129
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,680
your device like on your phone and your

130
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,959
phone gets sucked and

131
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,439
somebody can steal your funds uh you can

132
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
kind of mitigate that with other wallets

133
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,159
but then you

134
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,238
move into another like concern of um

135
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,120
like supply chain uh trust and these

136
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,478
this other wallet like

137
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,320
on import to steal bitcoins and this

138
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,520
kind of stuff so

139
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,280
it's always like a trade of air gap

140
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,040
devices i think they're good because you

141
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
can have like general purpose devices

142
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
like an old phone

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,240
and you can install an app that handles

144
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,080
keys on this phone so this is also a

145
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,040
good trade-off

146
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,759
if you are afraid of your main device uh

147
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,520
getting hacked

148
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,199
but also other ways you can lose funds

149
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,720
it's just you forget the

150
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,199
passphrase if you encrypt your bip 39

151
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,720
monica with an initial passphrase for

152
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,440
security

153
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,880
this is especially popular i would say

154
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
with some other wallets where they

155
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,160
really recommend to

156
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,400
use an extra mnemonic an extra pass

157
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,600
phrase to encrypt your money for

158
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,720
additional security

159
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,080
and you could forget the passphrase and

160
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,639
you're done uh also you add the mnemonic

161
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,440
too well

162
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
and you can find it anymore so you've

163
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
lost your funds like that

164
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
or you can try to make multiple copies

165
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,160
to mitigate that but then

166
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,800
you increase the risk of theft because

167
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
you have like multiple copies of the

168
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,759
same amount in multiple places

169
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,520
and if even just one of these places you

170
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,960
compromise you lose all your funds

171
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,720
or also on the other side you don't tie

172
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,560
them demonically enough even if it's

173
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
just in one place somebody could find it

174
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,039
and then steal your funds

175
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,039
so there are multi-signature wallets

176
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,080
they kind of mitigate some of these

177
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,960
issues that single-seat wallets have and

178
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,240
the definition basically of

179
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
multi-signature wallets is just a

180
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,840
wallet where you have to make more than

181
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
one key uh in order to spend

182
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,639
bitcoin from that wallet uh and this

183
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
more than one could be all of the keys

184
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,320
you have so you can have like five keys

185
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,840
and you need to sign with all of the

186
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,720
five keys

187
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
or even a threshold like a three or five

188
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
of the keys need to sign in order to

189
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
spend from the wallet

190
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
and these type of wallets they kind of

191
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,840
mitigate the risk of a single point of

192
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,280
failure the fact that

193
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,880
with single signature wall let you have

194
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,560
one spot

195
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,600
where the key exists and if i can attack

196
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,240
that spot

197
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
being it like the mnemonic written

198
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,520
somewhere or even like a device

199
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,840
if i can attack that spot i can steal

200
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,560
your fans

201
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
well instead with multi-signature wall

202
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,479
let's you have different devices

203
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,160
different keys are spread around

204
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
different places so it

205
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,960
it gets a bit harder to attack somebody

206
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
that is properly using multi-signature

207
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,319
wallets

208
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,680
the problem with that is that there are

209
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
not so many options today to choose from

210
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,240
much less than there are single single

211
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,440
signature wallets

212
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,919
so you're kind of forced to maybe use a

213
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,919
wallet that is not like the exact thing

214
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,360
you would like to have it's not

215
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,199
the perfect thing for you but there are

216
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,280
no other options you just have to use it

217
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,160
um some wallets just to mention them

218
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,440
electron between core

219
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
bitcoin core can also be used for single

220
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
sig wallets but i think it's a bit more

221
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,960
not so user friendly so i think there

222
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
are better options for average users

223
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,639
but here in the case of multisignatures

224
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,840
that are really not the many options so

225
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,039
bitcoin core i think is

226
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,680
a very valid option i also fully know

227
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
that inspector these are not

228
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,919
technically like other wallets separate

229
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,199
wallets these are like

230
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,360
remote controllers for your bitcoin core

231
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,440
node so they are kind of part of bitcoin

232
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,000
core

233
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
and there's also kaza which is a like a

234
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,759
custom solution for

235
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,160
um keeping your bitcoin secure using

236
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
multi-sigs

237
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,000
uh again you used to ask yourself how

238
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,599
can i lose my money if i'm using

239
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,680
multi-signature wallets

240
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,840
the threads are basically the same very

241
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
similar

242
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,800
to the single c wallet but it depends it

243
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
becomes more of a function

244
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
of your setup because you can choose a

245
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,120
threshold

246
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
and if you choose a very high threshold

247
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
you probably lower the theft risk

248
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,720
because an attacker would have to steal

249
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,440
more keys

250
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,599
in order to steal your funds but you

251
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,639
increase the

252
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,599
chance of an accidental loss so you lose

253
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,560
if you make like an

254
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,479
n of n you just you can just lose one

255
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,919
key and you've lost

256
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,080
all your funds so you have to kind of

257
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,599
balance that because on the other side

258
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,720
if you have low threshold

259
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,879
it's the opposite so you have many many

260
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,960
keys and for an attacker it's enough to

261
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,479
steal

262
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,479
a very low number of these keys in order

263
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,400
to steal your funds

264
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
uh and also there's another thing you

265
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,080
should uh keep in mind is that

266
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,240
more keys make transactions larger so if

267
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,759
you have like a very

268
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
um a very high number of keys i think

269
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,639
the limit is like 15 keys

270
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
or also very high threshold like an

271
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
eight out of eight

272
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,599
this transaction are going to get very

273
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,279
very big you pay a lot of

274
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,599
fees and also it's not good in general

275
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,519
for like scalability of the system if

276
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,719
everybody is using

277
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,679
a very big multi-signature wallets and i

278
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,839
think there's like a

279
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,320
really interesting kind of wallet which

280
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,040
is

281
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,720
time lock multi-signature wallets which

282
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
are kind of in between

283
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,040
so it's a i think it's a like really

284
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,240
good trade-off it's like a

285
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,160
multi-signature wallet

286
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,760
but with the threshold that can lower

287
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
over time so

288
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,399
this kind of mitigates the fact that

289
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,600
with a multi-signature wall that you

290
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
have to choose one threshold and you

291
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,680
have to stick with it

292
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,360
uh forever basically as long as you're

293
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
using the wallet and we

294
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,920
if you throw time locks in there you can

295
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,240
have

296
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,200
like a very high threshold initially oh

297
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,160
and you can use

298
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
both absolute and relative time locks

299
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,440
based on basically

300
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,640
what's your use case uh and you can

301
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,000
probably afford to use fewer

302
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,360
keys with another threshold because

303
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,959
worst case if you lose one of the keys

304
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,160
you just have to wait

305
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,440
a little while and after the time locks

306
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,760
expire you can spend with less keys and

307
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,959
maybe migrate to a new wallet

308
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,640
um the problem with that is that there

309
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
are even less uh

310
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,959
like consumer options that people can

311
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,720
use like products that people people can

312
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,440
use

313
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
the only one is probably green even

314
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,880
though it's not really meant to be like

315
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,240
a general purpose

316
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
uh time time-lock multi-signature wall

317
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,279
that is very

318
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,920
limited in in terms of how many keys you

319
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
can have and then who has these keys so

320
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,320
it's like

321
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,160
basically justice two of two where you

322
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,519
have one key and the server as the other

323
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,040
one and that's it you can't have like a

324
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
two of two with two keys that you

325
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,240
own but it's kinda it uses time locks

326
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,680
so it kind of falls in this category

327
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,920
and why there are no other options i i

328
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,040
mean i don't know and just

329
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,839
speculation i think uh for once the

330
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,279
reason that there wasn't like much

331
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,880
demand for this kind of stuff so people

332
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,920
were not really

333
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,399
aware that these existed and how this

334
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,440
could be used

335
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
and also i think they are fairly hard to

336
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
make so for a

337
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,040
new developer a new bitcoin developer is

338
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,880
easy to just make a single signal there

339
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,720
are plenty of libraries plenty of

340
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,920
examples and stuff to choose from

341
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,839
to make your own wallet well instead for

342
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
that you basically have to start from

343
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,240
scratch

344
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,680
and that's pretty hard considering you

345
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,760
also have to handle like very sensitive

346
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,839
key material

347
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,360
so this was like the first section just

348
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,079
like an overview of which wallet exists

349
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,519
i'm gonna start talking more about

350
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,000
privacy and by privacy i mean privacy is

351
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,399
a

352
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,640
very complicated topic but i mean i

353
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,560
divide privacy basically into separate

354
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,399
categories so the first one

355
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,040
is privacy in regards or like towards

356
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,279
the service provider of your wallet

357
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,279
meaning like there are wallets that

358
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,720
collect your ex pubs

359
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,200
to basically give you the balance so you

360
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,880
don't have to compute it yourself

361
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,920
this is a very bad privacy

362
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,880
practice this is very bad to do and this

363
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
is what i mean basically with privacy

364
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,399
toward the service provider

365
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,519
and this doesn't depend in any way

366
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,000
to the do basically the type of wallet

367
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,440
it is so it could be a single signal at

368
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,959
a multi-c wall it doesn't really matter

369
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,160
this is just a

370
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,640
depends on the way the wallet has been

371
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,399
built to interact with the blockchain so

372
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,040
this is all

373
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
up to the developer to choose which way

374
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,160
to use

375
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,760
on the other side there's another type

376
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,519
of privacy which i call like

377
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,440
transaction fingerprinting or privacy to

378
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
the public which basically means

379
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,880
if you have a wallet that make

380
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
transactions that are very very easy to

381
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,839
recognize and you are the only one in

382
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,560
the world

383
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
using that wallet your privacy is very

384
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,160
bad because even if you use

385
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,680
even if you use like your own full node

386
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,760
you do everything right i can still like

387
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,639
look at the blockchain

388
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,160
and i see some transactions that are

389
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,920
very very weird

390
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,399
they like stand out from the others and

391
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,399
i know this is probably you

392
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,560
and this doesn't depend on the way the

393
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,839
the wallet is built

394
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,160
this is just the type of wall that the

395
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,040
term is that

396
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,839
so especially it's best for single sig

397
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,560
wallets

398
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,160
because there are like many many people

399
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,839
using single sig wallets so you

400
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,639
kind of mix in the crowd you're just one

401
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,600
of them

402
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,680
but if you go into very specific like

403
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,519
custom scripts with time block with very

404
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,200
specific time locks

405
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
you start to lose a lot in terms of

406
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
privacy and unfortunately there's not

407
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,600
much you can do about that today

408
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,839
we can do something with future bitcoin

409
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,040
upgrades and i'm going to talk about

410
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,760
that

411
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,320
later on in the talk uh so now i made

412
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,279
this table

413
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,959
which i know it's going to be like a bit

414
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,560
controversial this is not

415
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,639
in any way a recommendation of which

416
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,959
wallet to use i just wanted to

417
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,120
make it like make a graphical way to

418
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,639
show what i'm trying to say

419
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,399
so if you and these are just a few

420
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,839
examples that are obviously a ton or

421
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,279
more i just had to

422
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,519
i picked the one i mentioned before so

423
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,959
the idea is that you can

424
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,200
i want to just to show that you can see

425
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
in the central column so the

426
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,360
provider privacy it looks kind of random

427
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,320
so what i want to

428
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,160
show is that if you have a single sequel

429
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,519
it doesn't have to be

430
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,560
a bad it doesn't have to have a bad

431
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,800
provider privacy so you can build single

432
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
c wallets

433
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
in a good way and in a bad way and the

434
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,519
same is for multi-signature wallets and

435
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,040
for a time lock multi-signal wallet

436
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,959
these are just choices the developers

437
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,120
made and they could have totally just

438
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,000
made another choice

439
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,320
and have a more private wallet while on

440
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
the other end the other column

441
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,760
you can see like a pattern so you can

442
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
see that it's good for single sig

443
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,199
wallets a little bit

444
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,680
worse for multi-signature wallets and

445
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,639
it's very bad

446
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,199
for uh time lock multisignatures because

447
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,079
you have a lot of

448
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,320
like room you can make a lot of you can

449
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,839
tweak a lot of parameters

450
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,920
and you make your wallet very unique and

451
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,199
you make it very

452
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,360
you make it basically stand out a lot in

453
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,639
the crowd

454
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,320
so again now i'm going to talk about

455
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,920
what can we improve today

456
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,959
um so this is mostly this like central

457
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,839
column how can developers build better

458
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,519
wallets that are more private

459
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,560
and that collect less data

460
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,399
i'm also just going to say one thing so

461
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,760
kaza is red

462
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,240
in here because it's closed source as

463
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,040
far as i know

464
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,320
so i don't know maybe it's like the most

465
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,920
private wallet but i couldn't like see

466
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,360
the code so i just

467
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,760
um i had to do it like to give it like a

468
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,279
bad score but this is not i'm not trying

469
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,000
to say don't use

470
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
kaza don't use green i'm just trying to

471
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
kind of highlight this uh

472
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,440
like these differences between the two

473
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,199
type of privacy

474
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,480
of privacies um so why do we need

475
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,360
better tools in general i think i don't

476
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,000
think

477
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,800
uh wallet developers like enjoy making

478
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,519
wallets with

479
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,199
bad privacy i just think that it's very

480
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,519
very hard to get that thing right

481
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,360
so if we make better tools for

482
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,760
developers uh we make it easier for them

483
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,880
to build better wallets

484
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,440
and they're probably going to choose

485
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,480
they're going to end up

486
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,800
basically making better wallets for for

487
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,360
the end users

488
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,680
in general i think it should be very

489
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,600
very helpful to simplify dealing with

490
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,199
critical parts of the bitcoin protocol

491
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:11,760
so

492
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,199
if you think about it most wallets are

493
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,800
just trying to do the same things over

494
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,360
and over

495
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,440
so they do transaction creation they do

496
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
coin selection they do signing they do

497
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,480
all these kind of stuff are basically

498
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,920
repeated everyone has to make them

499
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,160
and it's better if we can like abstract

500
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
these parts so we can collect these in

501
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,480
some

502
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,959
like very well peer-reviewed libraries

503
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,399
and then for you as a developer you

504
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,399
focus more on your product than

505
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,279
just doing these things over and over

506
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,800
again

507
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,639
uh and also i think this ultimately

508
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,920
means that there are more options for

509
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,360
the end user so

510
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,279
uh if it's easier to make like a

511
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,120
multi-sig or a time lock multisignature

512
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,199
wallet i think more developers would

513
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,120
actually make them which means that the

514
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,399
end user has a

515
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,720
more more options to choose from and

516
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,959
it's easier for them to pick like the

517
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,839
one that is

518
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,279
uh exactly right for them um

519
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,199
so the first like tool i want to talk

520
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,320
about i

521
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,839
really don't want to make this too

522
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,360
technical so i'm just going to be

523
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,839
just going to do like a very high level

524
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,560
overview

525
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,399
of these tools the first thing which i

526
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,759
think is really really nice

527
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,399
especially for complex multi-signature

528
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,000
wallets is miniscript

529
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,160
basically miniscript lets you write

530
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,399
spending policies very easily

531
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,440
which means that you don't have to play

532
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,959
with the bitcoin scripting language

533
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,720
which is pretty complicated

534
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,399
so for you as a developer even if you're

535
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,240
not like a very experienced bitcoin

536
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,320
developer you're just a normal developer

537
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
you can pretty easily use miniscript to

538
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,680
build like a

539
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,360
time lock multisignature wall as well on

540
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,199
the other hand it would have been

541
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,279
it is much harder to do that like from

542
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,560
from scratch

543
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,320
uh it also one thing that is very

544
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,399
interesting it optimizes these scripts

545
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,440
for space

546
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,759
so in general if you if you try to do

547
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,680
like complex condition you have a ton of

548
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,959
ways to do that

549
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,279
and you try maybe manually to just pick

550
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,040
the optimal one but it's very hard to do

551
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,440
that

552
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
one instead mini script is like a

553
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,040
compiler it's like basically for for the

554
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,000
better offers it's

555
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,919
like writing a high-level language or

556
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,839
like low-level assembly code it's very

557
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,720
easy to

558
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
to use and it optimizes them for space

559
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
which ultimately means that

560
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,520
the end user pays less fees and

561
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,000
as a lower like on-chain footprint

562
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,919
uh it also specifically i'm talking

563
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,760
about the rust version of mini script it

564
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,319
provides

565
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,039
like some really nice tools to work with

566
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
generalized scripts

567
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,480
um so for you as a developer again you

568
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,520
don't have to

569
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,799
play with bitcoin scripts you can just

570
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,000
ask that tool to do that for you and an

571
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,640
example of a product using it is revolt

572
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,000
which is like a vaulting bitcoin vault

573
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
protocol

574
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
they use a ras mini script and then they

575
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,240
they're building everything else

576
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,160
on top of it but it's very helpful for

577
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,000
them because they have to make like

578
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,400
a four or four if i remember correctly

579
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
it's like a 404 with with some

580
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,440
pre-signed transaction that

581
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,640
sends to to other type of scripts

582
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,320
and so it's very easy for them to use

583
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,919
that to handle

584
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,760
all of the like complex bitcoin

585
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,600
scripting part

586
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,919
this is just like an example just to

587
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:10,880
show what

588
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,000
the miniscript spending policy

589
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
looks like and again it's not like

590
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
something that the average user can do

591
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,200
and i'm not expecting the other user to

592
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,760
do that

593
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,280
but for a developer it's very easy to

594
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,039
write write down something like that

595
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,760
that says

596
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,320
you need to sign with this key and then

597
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,679
either with that key or

598
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,760
wait a time lock i think this is the

599
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,360
representation of the

600
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,400
block stream green like script

601
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,360
so you have your the user the user key

602
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,559
always has to sign

603
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,480
and the other key which is the server

604
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,799
key can sign or you can wait a time lock

605
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,360
and then just with the user key you can

606
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,240
take the funds and on the next level

607
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,200
there's bdk

608
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
which is the project i've been working

609
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
on which is

610
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,960
basically not just a tool to work with

611
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,000
scripts but it's like

612
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,039
a full bitcoin wallet implementation

613
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,880
and we're really trying to make it like

614
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,760
very very modular so the idea is that

615
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,240
for you as a developer you can choose

616
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,160
one of the default modules and just

617
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,679
build the wallet with these pieces like

618
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,039
put them together and

619
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,080
make a wallet or you can also choose to

620
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,720
like

621
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,280
rewrite some of these uh modules

622
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,080
yourself if you

623
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,679
if you need like some kind of

624
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,840
specialized like behavior

625
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,480
uh it uses miniscript internally so this

626
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:24,880
is

627
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,480
uh this basically means that it supports

628
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,559
generalized scripts so with this bdk

629
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,320
wallet you can do like a single seek you

630
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,840
can do a multisig you can do

631
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
time blocks you can do all this kind of

632
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,679
stuff and from the user or i mean the

633
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,080
developer perspective using this

634
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,400
library it's all the same thing so it's

635
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,679
basically the same flow

636
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,840
create a transaction and sign it and the

637
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,360
coin selection is done automatically and

638
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
you can bump the fees and everything

639
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,799
all the logic is in there and the goal

640
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,640
for bdk is basically to

641
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,720
make a library that almost anybody can

642
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,960
use so if you need to do something that

643
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,200
touches bitcoin transaction in any way

644
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,000
uh some

645
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,600
not only some kind of wallet also for

646
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,200
some like some kind of

647
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
back-end service or something like that

648
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,559
you can just use bdk

649
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,480
and you can either just use it as it is

650
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,919
out of the box or tweak it

651
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,200
uh basically the way you need it

652
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,360
uh and yeah it adds all these functions

653
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
on top of mini script

654
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,520
so as a developer the the goal is for a

655
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,640
developer just

656
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,200
make it focus on high level problems not

657
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,720
low level bitcoin stuff also because

658
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,360
it's like a

659
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,120
waste of everybody's time to just keep

660
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,400
doing the same stuff

661
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,720
uh over over and over again it's just

662
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,679
better to have

663
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,000
one well pre-reviewed library and and

664
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,240
use that one uh

665
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
just a practical example again you

666
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,039
should take this with a grain of salt

667
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,240
because it's not really a

668
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,280
one-to-one perfect comparison but i'm

669
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,799
pretty familiar with gdk

670
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,640
which is the green development kit which

671
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,720
is the library that is at the base

672
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
of the green wallet because i used to

673
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,080
work on this stuff

674
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,919
so as a kind of a challenge to myself

675
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,600
while i was developing bdk

676
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,880
i tried to make a clone of that so just

677
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,039
redo the exact same thing in a different

678
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,080
language so there are

679
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,919
many things that cannot be compared

680
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,000
directly but the idea is that

681
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,520
for you as a developer you want to

682
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,360
remake green you can go

683
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,840
the everything from scratch route you

684
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
have to write a ton of code

685
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,640
and not only a ton of code in terms of

686
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,799
line which is this is not too bad

687
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,600
it's also a ton of very critical code so

688
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,400
it's like

689
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
signing code and even things like

690
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,400
generating an address it might seem

691
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,120
trivial

692
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,480
but you have to be very careful because

693
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,159
if you generate the wrong address then

694
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,440
you

695
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,039
basically lose your funds you can send

696
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,559
funds to an address which is uh

697
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,480
basically expandable so again it's

698
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,880
really not a one-to-one comparison

699
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,080
near which is this clone of gdk

700
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,760
it doesn't support many of the things

701
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,280
that gdk supports

702
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,200
but most importantly these 718 lines

703
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,679
are mostly like glue code the way i call

704
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,720
it so it's like

705
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,799
code to authenticate with the back end

706
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,240
and make

707
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,080
an api call to the back end to get the

708
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
signature it's not

709
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,880
sensitive code like bitcoin code

710
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,280
so for you as a developer you can go the

711
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,559
bdk route

712
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,799
and you write much less code and at

713
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,559
least not sensitive code even if you're

714
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,039
not

715
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,360
a very big like a huge bitcoin expert

716
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,640
you can probably

717
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,799
make something like that which is pretty

718
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,559
cool i think

719
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,840
um and now this was the uh what can we

720
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,960
improve today so

721
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,640
all of these things i mentioned they can

722
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,720
be done today we don't need any kind of

723
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,760
like bitcoin uh protocol upgrade

724
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,840
it's literally just a matter of uh

725
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
sitting down and

726
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,760
actually developing stuff uh and now i'm

727
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,280
gonna be talking a little bit about

728
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,039
what does the future look like so what

729
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,880
can we uh

730
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
do to make bitcoin even better going

731
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,360
forward in terms of bitcoin upgrades

732
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,320
um and specifically i'm speaking about

733
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,760
privacy because i think

734
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
already with current like bitcoin uh

735
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,159
scripting system i think you can do very

736
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,679
very powerful things so i don't think we

737
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,640
are very limited

738
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,159
in that sense we don't need really any

739
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,080
extra feature to that

740
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
but we need to increase privacy a lot

741
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,520
because if you do as i was saying before

742
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,480
if you do like

743
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,000
custom scripts uh that has a pretty bad

744
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,120
privacy on chain so

745
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
i think we should work on that and

746
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,400
specifically i'm going to be talking

747
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,919
about the taproot upgrade

748
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,000
which is currently being reviewed and i

749
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,840
think it really improves the

750
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,480
public privacy so that was the last

751
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,000
column in the table i was

752
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
showing you before considerably at least

753
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,640
in the average case so there could be

754
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,480
the worst case scenario when the privacy

755
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,880
is not as good but in the average case

756
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
um i think it is much better compared to

757
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,280
what we have today

758
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,120
um so before we talk about tablet i'm

759
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,880
going to talk about our signature

760
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
without going into the crypto details

761
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
because i don't even know them myself so

762
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,880
just

763
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,679
high level uh overview of these uh which

764
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,159
is

765
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,840
this nor signature upgrade is also

766
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,240
coming uh together with the type of

767
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,480
darkroot upgrade it's like a big part of

768
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
it

769
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,360
and the idea is that certain short

770
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
signatures are just like a different

771
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,159
signature scheme

772
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,240
compared to the cdc which is what's what

773
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,600
is currently uh

774
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,200
being used in bitcoin they were patented

775
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,799
until february 2008

776
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,200
so we don't really know why satoshi

777
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,400
didn't use them but

778
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
probably the best guess is just that

779
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,520
they were not

780
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,080
very widely known and understood because

781
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,840
they were patented

782
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
and so the probably the easiest way was

783
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
just to use a cdsa

784
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
which was much better understood much

785
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,799
more there were many more

786
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,240
like tools to work with these kind of

787
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,440
signatures available at that time

788
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,360
uh and the very very cool thing about

789
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
norse signatures is that they support

790
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,279
key aggregation which basically mean

791
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,559
that if you have like

792
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,760
two public keys amb you can combine them

793
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,320
in a way that you get one single public

794
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,080
key again so it's not two public keys

795
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,360
you have just one

796
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,960
but in order to sign for that public key

797
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,400
you have to make two separate signatures

798
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,320
one with the private key of a one with

799
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
the private key of b and then you can

800
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
aggregate them together and you have a

801
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,080
valid signatures for the aggregation

802
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,520
like a plus b this is very very nice

803
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,039
first of all for multisignatures in

804
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,799
general because you can have multi

805
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,799
signatures that end up looking like a

806
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,159
single signature on chain

807
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,159
so nobody looking at the blockchain can

808
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,760
know uh that

809
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,400
that signature was made by multiple

810
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,200
parties just

811
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,279
it just looks like a single signature

812
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,279
which is very very nice for privacy

813
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,600
uh and also i think you can support even

814
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,360
like threshold signature with more

815
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,000
complex like crypto setup but even just

816
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,960
being able to do an

817
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,320
n of n uh with that privacy uh

818
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
guarantee i i think it's uh i think it's

819
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,679
great

820
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,159
and top root builds on top of that i

821
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,559
think tupper can be summarized in a way

822
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,960
as having an address that is both a

823
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,080
single sig

824
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,120
and a more complex type of address at

825
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,080
the same time

826
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,240
so the pay to public key addresses or

827
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,600
paypal cash

828
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,440
is what we use today for single

829
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,880
signature addresses

830
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,200
it's basically an address that says make

831
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,799
a signature with this public key and you

832
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,039
can

833
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,360
spend the funds from here while the pay

834
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,000
to script or pay to script

835
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,480
type of addresses are everything else so

836
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,360
everything else you have

837
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,200
like more complicated you express it as

838
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,279
a bitcoin script and then you pay

839
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,120
to that bitcoin script and then you have

840
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,039
to satisfy this business script in order

841
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,320
to move your funds

842
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,600
and now you have to choose it's like

843
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,279
either one or the other and when you

844
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,039
choose the pay to script

845
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,600
pay to script dash type of addresses

846
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,760
when you go spend you have to reveal the

847
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,159
full

848
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,760
like bitcoin script you have to reveal

849
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,440
all the

850
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,799
all the conditions that were in the

851
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,240
script even if you're not using them so

852
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,120
if you have a script

853
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,440
that has like a few possible branches

854
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,760
with like ores logical or so you can use

855
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,840
this one or that one or that other one

856
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,520
you still have to reveal all of them

857
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,200
they will go publicly on chain

858
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,960
this takes up a lot of space and it's

859
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
very very bad in terms of privacy

860
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,720
because again everybody can see these

861
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,559
conditions and they can link together

862
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,480
transactions that have similar condition

863
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,080
they can they can try to assume

864
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,919
that they're probably part of the same

865
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,159
uh wallet

866
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,080
so yeah peter publicly issues what we

867
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,000
use currently for a single sig

868
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,080
with taproot we will actually use these

869
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,000
for multi signatures too because of what

870
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,559
i was

871
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,840
talking about before so the fact that

872
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,760
you can have individual keys you can

873
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
aggregate them and you can make

874
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,640
one single key which is now an

875
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,200
aggregation of multiple keys

876
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,520
and then you can also attach like extra

877
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,039
conditions that are not revealed

878
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,240
immediately so

879
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,799
for like an external observer what they

880
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,360
would see

881
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,000
is just like a single seek address

882
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,960
basically

883
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,080
uh but inside that there are extra

884
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,120
conditions that have been

885
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,240
uh like encoded in a way uh

886
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,159
and if you need to use those conditions

887
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,360
whenever you go

888
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,039
spend from that address you reveal this

889
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,120
condition and show everybody that they

890
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,720
were actually embedded in the address so

891
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,200
you

892
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,399
just you didn't make them up uh at the

893
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,760
last minute

894
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,960
uh and i think the base idea the idea at

895
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,640
the base of taproot is just that

896
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,000
most of the times especially when you

897
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,679
have like multi-party protocols

898
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,640
most of the time the protocol goes fine

899
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,320
everybody agrees that the protocol went

900
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,200
fine so if it's

901
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
like a trade or something like that and

902
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,279
there's no need to use these safety

903
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,000
clauses like

904
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
the backup clauses where i don't know

905
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,120
like alice and bob

906
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,399
are doing something together and at

907
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,159
least needs to get

908
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,240
funds back uh most of the time you don't

909
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,279
need that and it's kind of a shame with

910
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,159
p2sh or pay to script ash addresses

911
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,440
because these conditions are always

912
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,799
there even if you don't use them

913
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,399
when instead with taproot you can hide

914
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,840
them completely if the

915
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,120
protocol goes uh well or you can only

916
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,919
reveal the

917
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,840
like little parts the views and not the

918
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,120
full

919
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,760
the the full conditions which is also

920
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,919
pretty good in terms of privacy

921
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,919
and just to make an example uh there's

922
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,520
definitely a better way to make this

923
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
specific example but i just wanted to

924
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
give you like an idea of how this thing

925
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,679
works uh we can assume we have alice and

926
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,840
bob and alice wants to sell

927
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,480
bitcoin to bob i don't know if it's a

928
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,880
good

929
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,559
financial decision but she wants to do

930
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,440
it so we let her do it

931
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,279
the idea is that alice can create this

932
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,200
taproot address where the public key

933
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,840
part

934
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,720
is her public key and bob's public key

935
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,840
uh join them

936
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,720
join together so it's basically multisig

937
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
two of two multisig for the public key

938
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,440
part

939
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,480
and then for the script she can use like

940
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,000
whatever other conditions she wants and

941
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,279
in this case you will have a two of

942
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:13,840
three

943
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,720
with her key bob's key and a third party

944
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,039
that

945
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,000
basically acts as an escrow uh in this

946
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,799
protocol

947
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,120
that can like arbitrate between the two

948
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,559
and just decide

949
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,559
who should get the funds in case

950
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,559
something goes wrong

951
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,799
then alice can send bitcoin to that

952
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,240
address

953
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,000
if everything goes smoothly alice

954
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,559
receives her i don't know fiat money

955
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,559
she says right so i've received my money

956
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,760
everything went right

957
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,320
i will sign a new transaction that moves

958
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,679
the funds from this

959
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,039
like weird address to just bob bob's

960
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,760
address

961
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,360
bobs will also sign it they combine

962
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,600
their signature and they just spend

963
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,720
using the public key way so this on

964
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,640
chain would look like a single sig

965
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,799
wallet basically making a transfer so

966
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,240
you send to this single sig wallet and

967
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,679
you spend from the single sig wallet and

968
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,720
nobody knows

969
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,000
uh what was like going on uh behind the

970
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,679
scenes

971
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,279
then if b or bob doesn't pay

972
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,720
i don't know like fiat money back to

973
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,200
alice alice can reveal the script

974
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,440
and ask the escrow to sign using the

975
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,960
other way so

976
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,760
alice herself can sign and the escrow i

977
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,279
don't know we'll probably look for some

978
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,080
kind of proof

979
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,840
from from alice we'll contact bob

980
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,679
whatever we do the checks you need to do

981
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,000
and then he says all right i can i'm

982
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,360
very sure bob didn't pay

983
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,840
so i will give you your money back the

984
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,799
escrow signs

985
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,440
ali signs these two signatures are

986
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,279
enough to satisfy the two of three

987
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,679
so they can still spend using the other

988
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,399
branch

989
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,279
and this unchain you will see that on

990
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,640
chain so you will see that

991
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,120
something went wrong and somebody had to

992
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,720
use these two of three

993
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,200
um potentially there could be even other

994
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,640
more complex condition that would not be

995
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,440
revealed

996
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,640
um but in that case something would show

997
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,039
up

998
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,640
but this is again like a worst case

999
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,799
scenario so if everything goes smoothly

1000
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,200
this is just a single seek transaction

1001
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,360
which means very low fees very high

1002
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,559
privacy and everything and obviously if

1003
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,120
on the other end like bob pays and then

1004
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,880
alice refuses to

1005
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,000
sign the transaction that moves the

1006
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,240
money to bob and just bob

1007
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
bob can do the same thing so bob can ask

1008
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,679
the escrow to sign

1009
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,000
in his favor and again the escrow will i

1010
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,960
don't know like ask

1011
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,919
alice and and check uh in this case it's

1012
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:30,880
actually pretty easy if

1013
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,559
there's no signature from alice it's

1014
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,679
clear that alice doesn't want to

1015
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,960
cooperate so

1016
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,919
it will cooperate with bob to recover

1017
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,080
his funds

1018
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,919
so yeah i think we are pretty much at

1019
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,360
the end here

1020
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,080
conclusion i would say bitcoin tools are

1021
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,720
improving

1022
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,440
constantly i saw like people on twitter

1023
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,120
complaining a little bit about

1024
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,519
the fact that the bitcoin world is kind

1025
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,559
of stagnating

1026
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,640
in a way it's not really changing that

1027
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,080
much i think

1028
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,000
maybe that can actually be true compared

1029
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
to a few years ago but i think

1030
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,519
definitely there's a lot going on

1031
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,279
kind of behind the scenes uh that

1032
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,360
hopefully uh when they will

1033
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,960
uh will hit the market uh also finally

1034
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,159
there are a few other things that i

1035
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,000
couldn't mention right now

1036
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
but i think it's very good to see the

1037
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,440
ecosystem finally converging on a few

1038
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,360
good standards so psbt

1039
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,960
above all the fact that you can have

1040
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,640
like different wallets that can

1041
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,080
cooperate with each other very easily

1042
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,840
this makes it very easy to do like

1043
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,440
multi-signature wallets because you can

1044
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,320
have

1045
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,679
it's actually probably a good practice

1046
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,440
to have different wallets to

1047
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,000
mitigate the risk of one wallet like one

1048
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,360
specific piece of

1049
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,840
software getting hacked so you can have

1050
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,600
multiple wallets different ones

1051
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,679
other wallets whatever they can all sign

1052
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,039
individually and then you can

1053
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,000
combine the psvts and have one just

1054
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,880
final transaction

1055
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,679
hopefully developers will start using

1056
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,279
these tools and make better wallets for

1057
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:53,840
everybody

1058
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,440
i think this is going to take a while

1059
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,960
probably like a couple of years but

1060
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,760
eventually i think

1061
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,880
they're gonna eat the market also tablet

1062
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,600
is great

1063
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,200
i saw on twitter people kind of

1064
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,039
complaining about not really complaining

1065
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:05,679
but just

1066
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,320
like they couldn't understand why would

1067
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,440
they want to support

1068
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,519
uproot why would i want to support this

1069
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,360
software to include taproot

1070
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,399
uh and hopefully this presentation uh

1071
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,399
gave these people like at least one use

1072
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,679
case because there are probably many

1073
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,559
many more that i can

1074
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,799
even think about but uh for this use

1075
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,000
case tablet is great in terms

1076
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,080
of privacy it lets you make very complex

1077
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,440
wallets with

1078
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,600
for the best case and unless you eat

1079
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,360
like very very specific cases and

1080
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,960
they're like very very private very very

1081
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,880
scalable which is good

1082
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
um and yeah i think this is it if you

1083
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,159
have any questions we have like 10

1084
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,550
minutes

1085
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,889
[Music]

1086
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,200
seems like dark question so please go

1087
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,880
ahead

1088
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,640
regarding the tools that you were

1089
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
describing this uh manuscript

1090
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,760
or vdk they

1091
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,159
are still like they are still on their

1092
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:00,799
development

1093
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,159
or that i mean they are not yet used by

1094
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,000
any real wallet or are there any

1095
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,199
plans to be used or yeah so miniscript i

1096
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,918
think is

1097
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,679
at least the rust version because this

1098
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,119
is the one i'm most familiar with

1099
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,679
i think this is out of beta so i think

1100
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,079
it's like production ready but i don't

1101
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:18,399
know

1102
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,079
any production tool already using it

1103
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,839
so it's there are people using them so

1104
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,918
it's very very early still

1105
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,320
for bdk it's still not really like

1106
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,520
production ready

1107
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,960
i have no idea how long it's going to

1108
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,879
take probably a few more months

1109
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,800
so we already like encouraging people to

1110
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,079
try it out because

1111
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,679
there are a lot of bugs that these

1112
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,679
people find because especially when you

1113
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,679
go with like very complex scripts

1114
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,359
you can't really think of any case so

1115
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,879
it's good to have people that come

1116
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,359
they try them out and they report uh

1117
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,239
issues

1118
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,639
so so yeah the answer is for me script

1119
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,719
it the tool itself is probably

1120
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,839
production ready

1121
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,760
not really any product using it and for

1122
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,119
bdk still like

1123
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,160
beta you can try it out but it's not i

1124
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,839
wouldn't recommend using it like with

1125
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:02,320
real

1126
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,320
money yeah thank you

1127
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,839
so one more question over there

1128
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,560
thanks um hi hi alekas uh yeah um i have

1129
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,640
a question about

1130
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,359
uh public what you called public privacy

1131
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:19,920
in your

1132
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,040
present yeah so um wallet fingerprinting

1133
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,960
obviously you were highlighting how

1134
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,000
uh having custom scripts makes uh the

1135
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,440
wallet profoundly less private in the

1136
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,640
sense it has a

1137
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
smaller anonymity set example of green

1138
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,839
for example but

1139
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,320
um have you thought much about like

1140
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,440
randomizing

1141
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,359
in the context of wallet fingerprinting

1142
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,960
it's an interesting topic that's come up

1143
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,359
from some quarters like uh

1144
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,160
i mean the thing is that if you wanted

1145
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,200
to have your wallet not be

1146
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,640
fingerprintable you've got a huge

1147
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,079
problem on your hand you've got to deal

1148
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:54,800
with

1149
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,280
uh you know the transaction even like

1150
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,440
the n version the n lock time

1151
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,720
it's not just the scripts obviously the

1152
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,240
script is a huge one but there's tons of

1153
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,760
other even things that aren't actually

1154
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,320
like

1155
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,560
as obvious like utxo selection can give

1156
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,720
away which wallet it is

1157
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,040
so it's really an almost impossible

1158
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,480
problem to solve but i just wondered if

1159
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,760
you'd thought about because i know some

1160
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,599
other people have thought about

1161
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,359
can we at least partially help or

1162
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,160
address this problem by using

1163
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,760
techniques of actually randomizing what

1164
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,359
our fingerprints are rather than trying

1165
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,800
to homogenize and make everyone have the

1166
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,320
same fingerprint which as you point out

1167
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,000
because you need functionality specific

1168
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,480
to your wallet you can't really do that

1169
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,440
um yeah so i haven't really thought

1170
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,640
about it myself

1171
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,960
i know yeah i was very much like

1172
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,560
oversimplifying here so that's

1173
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,000
definitely not the only thing that

1174
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,599
allows you to like fingerprint a

1175
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,359
specific wallet here i was mostly

1176
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,320
talking about

1177
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,400
not fingerprinting a type of wallet but

1178
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
like a specific person because if a

1179
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,800
person

1180
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400
can have like a lot of room to play

1181
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
around with scripts uh

1182
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,200
i don't know a person could decide to

1183
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,119
have like a very weird time lock like

1184
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,440
one day and a half that nobody else uses

1185
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,000
so you can fingerprint like all of these

1186
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,359
transactions are from the same

1187
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,720
wallet in a sense of the same

1188
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
application but you could even

1189
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,320
with this even worse you can actually

1190
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,560
like pinpoint the the

1191
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,760
one user of this wallet um so in terms

1192
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,240
of that

1193
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,560
i've been doing some stuff on vdk so for

1194
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,640
instance on vdk we try to support

1195
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,680
um like randomizing

1196
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,280
output order inputs and outputs ordering

1197
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,880
also the bib 69 i think lexicographical

1198
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,480
ordering all this kind of stuff

1199
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,720
uh yeah i think it's pretty hard it will

1200
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,920
probably require

1201
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,200
like some some proper research to

1202
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,560
see like what wall let's do uh

1203
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,640
some what different wall let's do that

1204
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,920
make them send out

1205
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,079
and then try to reproduce the same

1206
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,760
behavior and then you can like randomize

1207
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,200
and do one transaction

1208
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,720
looking like a wasabi wallet and one

1209
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,079
transaction looking something like

1210
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,119
something else

1211
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,359
so with bdk we would like to do

1212
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,800
something like that so in general you

1213
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,480
have like a lot of flexibility on

1214
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,079
the way the transaction is created you

1215
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,520
can choose this

1216
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,280
specific time lock you can choose a

1217
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,200
specific sequence

1218
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,280
you can choose all this kind of stuff so

1219
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,520
if we if somebody or us

1220
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,359
we do like a proper research that we

1221
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,560
could try to

1222
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,400
have something that takes a transaction

1223
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,920
and kind of changes it a little bit to

1224
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,560
look like

1225
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,240
one specific wallet and then you can

1226
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,000
randomize it for every transaction

1227
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,760
you make so it's definitely something

1228
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,160
that i think is interesting because

1229
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,680
even if you use top routes you still

1230
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,320
have those uh potential lacks of privacy

1231
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,720
so

1232
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,119
you need both for like a very very

1233
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,359
publicly private wallet

1234
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,560
so yeah i haven't really thought about

1235
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,760
it but it's definitely something we

1236
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,560
should try to

1237
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,680
to do in the future i think

1238
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,480
do we have any more questions

1239
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,720
thank you for a talk uh you also talked

1240
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
about the proof and

1241
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,560
um yeah i love it um thank you so much

1242
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,320
to mention that and i

1243
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,560
uh so we wanted to ask you not sure if

1244
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,760
you mentioned that

1245
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,400
uh would you support activation of the

1246
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,680
upload by bip8

1247
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,640
beep to use to activate uh i honestly

1248
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,920
have no idea so i've read a lot of

1249
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,359
discussions on that i don't know what's

1250
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,640
the best one

1251
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,880
um like for me personally i like taproot

1252
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,920
so i would say go

1253
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,079
for the one i remember which beep it is

1254
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,359
the one that at the end

1255
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,839
just forcibly enables it so even if the

1256
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:18,960
miner don't agree

1257
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,480
it enables it but this is just my

1258
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,240
opinion because i like tarpoot and i can

1259
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,520
also imagine there are other people that

1260
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,720
don't like it

1261
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,560
uh so i really don't know i don't know

1262
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,079
what's the best answer here it's

1263
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,000
probably more of a social thing than a

1264
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,280
technical

1265
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,920
issue so i don't know i don't think

1266
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,480
there's a

1267
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,359
good answer for that

1268
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,839
any more questions just one more

1269
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,720
can you please free explain why uh

1270
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,560
bitcoin core you don't have public

1271
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,760
privacy for

1272
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,240
multisig uh yeah so this just means that

1273
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,920
if you have like a multi-sig

1274
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
with this very weird threshold like you

1275
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,960
do a two

1276
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,240
of eight that nobody else is using

1277
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,839
uh if i look at the transaction on chain

1278
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,599
and i look at all the transactions that

1279
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:03,920
are

1280
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,960
a two of eight i can restrict like a lot

1281
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,680
the anonymity set in a way so this is

1282
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,960
not due to the way

1283
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
bitcoin core does it or the way electron

1284
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,640
does it it's just the fact that if you

1285
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,200
leave the user freedom to choose these

1286
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,720
parameters they could choose like very

1287
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,000
very specific

1288
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
parameters that they only use themselves

1289
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,440
so then you can identify

1290
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,119
this transaction probably belongs to

1291
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,200
this user just for this reason even if

1292
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,280
everything else is done right so even if

1293
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,880
you coin join and everything

1294
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,839
um so yeah this is why it's not inherent

1295
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:34,160
to

1296
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,319
bitcoin core itself it's just if you use

1297
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,560
a weird

1298
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,800
number of key and threshold that nobody

1299
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,440
else is using

1300
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,610
[Applause]

1301
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,929
[Music]

1302
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,140
thanks

1303
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,800
[Applause]

1304
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,880
you
