00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,560
hi

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,080
i love this year's topic um

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,320
the manifesto captures the duality of

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,520
technology and the people that use it

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,720
but i think like most of us it makes the

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,520
assumption

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,880
that technology is amoral and that it

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,760
all depends on how you use it

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,400
technology can definitely be moral or

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,439
immoral

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,559
just by the nature of its function but

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,480
i'd actually like to talk about that

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,839
so let me just put my slides up

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
oh

16
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,840
okay everyone see the slides

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
great

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,920
i believe we are becoming so integrated

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,960
with technology

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,439
that we are losing our ability to

21
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,040
objectively judge technology

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,119
good and evil are becoming more and more

23
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,600
blurred as our online world and offline

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,159
world

25
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,079
start to become indistinct

26
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,520
indistinguishable from

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
one another our free will

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,400
is becoming compromised as we let

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
technology direct us

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,119
more than we direct it we

31
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,600
are starting to think like the internet

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,320
and we

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:55,839
are starting to act like the machine

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,280
um sorry i'm gonna try and full screen

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
this because i don't think it's full

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:09,679
screen is that

37
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,440
good all right

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,440
yeah awesome okay it's it is full screen

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,840
great

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200
sorry about that okay

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,920
the digital totality is indeed upon us

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,000
and we must remember that with

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,599
every extension there's an amputation

44
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,760
there's no innovation that does not take

45
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,519
something away from us

46
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,440
let's look at something as seemingly

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,519
basic as writing

48
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,280
socrates tells us the story of an

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,319
egyptian god who visits king famous

50
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,959
the god praises the art of writing but

51
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,840
the king

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
expresses concern they will cease to

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,640
exercise memory because they will rely

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,120
on

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
that which is written calling things to

56
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,319
remembrance

57
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,720
no longer from within themselves but by

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,680
the means of external marks

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,080
they will have an appearance of wisdom

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,519
while for the most part

61
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,480
they will know nothing

62
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,560
writing down information is a relatively

63
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,760
new innovation

64
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,280
people used to store everything they

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,200
needed in their memory

66
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,599
the giant books that hold stories like

67
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
the iliad and odyssey

68
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,680
were were verbally transmitted from

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,879
person's person

70
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,239
they had meaning were internalized

71
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,799
and digested and memorized using

72
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,480
algorithmic rhyming schemes

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
which is something almost unimaginable

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,879
to us today

75
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,959
we automatically assume that if these

76
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,959
stories were never written down

77
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,840
we would not have them today but it's

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,760
the opposite that's true

79
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,720
they are no longer it's opposite that's

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,480
true

81
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,239
no one can recall these stories from

82
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,599
memory anymore

83
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
because they were written down they are

84
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
not no longer internal or part of us

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,959
they are outside of us that is the

86
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
amputation

87
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,120
i guess the extension is you can now

88
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,840
follow homer

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
the modern example of this loss of

90
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,519
memory

91
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,640
is when scientists used mris to study

92
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,959
the brains of successful london cabbies

93
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,560
who had memorized extensive driving

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,238
routes around the city

95
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
they found a visible increase in the

96
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,520
size of their hippocampus

97
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,680
this is not present in cabbies that

98
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,800
failed the exam or

99
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,919
in regular people that rely on gps but

100
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,960
the criticism

101
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
here goes beyond becoming forgetful if

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,840
we do not remember things

103
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,720
we do not truly absorb and process them

104
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,800
information is no longer an authentic

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,080
part of us it is outsourced glanced at

106
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,120
in times of need or want information

107
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,680
becomes

108
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,440
shallow and so do we

109
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,199
information is power but only if it's

110
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,680
processed only if it's good information

111
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,160
only if we know what to do with it and

112
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,800
only if we

113
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
actually do something with it

114
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,320
we have too much information this makes

115
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,639
things simultaneously overwhelming

116
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,120
and irrelevant the higher the number of

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,039
deaths the harder it is to empathize

118
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,800
with those deaths

119
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
two-bench information also leads to

120
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,240
distraction

121
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
deep uninterrupted intake of even good

122
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,120
information has become difficult

123
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,039
if you read a document with hyperlinks

124
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,240
you actually score lower in

125
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
comprehension because you overload your

126
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
working memory

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,440
it's hard to remember things because

128
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,960
there are too many things to remember

129
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,680
and as we discussed earlier if you can't

130
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,800
remember something

131
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,080
can it really have meaning we are

132
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
suckers for relevancy as clifford nas

133
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,039
put it

134
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,880
when the printing press was invented and

135
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
we had the first major explosion of

136
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,240
publications

137
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,919
serious authors warned us about the

138
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,919
dangers of garbage content

139
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,440
i wonder what they would think of the

140
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,199
content we have today

141
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,120
and i wonder what the average person

142
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
from the middle ages would think of the

143
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
average person today

144
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,319
we have all the information at our

145
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,639
fingertips and the majority of us

146
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,080
do absolutely nothing with it too much

147
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,039
information

148
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,000
actually subverts and pacifies just

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,039
think of an event

150
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,360
social movement or even war that the

151
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,919
media has covered endlessly

152
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
especially with the age of social media

153
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,479
this extensive coverage of an event

154
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,919
neutralizes us to its significance

155
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,840
also today we are less likely to

156
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
actually do something useful with the

157
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,080
information

158
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,560
we have because passing on or posting

159
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,360
the information

160
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,199
makes us feel like we already did

161
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,600
something

162
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,639
so socrates warned remembering has been

163
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,280
replaced

164
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,160
by writing now writing is being replaced

165
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,199
by typing

166
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,120
we aren't even teaching kids to write in

167
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
cursive anymore

168
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,599
or write at all in some cases

169
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,919
it is important to understand that when

170
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,360
there's an innovation

171
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,280
it does not just add or improve

172
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,120
something it usually

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,520
replaces something at least in part

174
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,000
let's look at something that may seem

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,759
benign

176
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,880
the front-facing garage door

177
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,440
this is how the majority of american

178
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:19,919
houses

179
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,160
are built today the small this small

180
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,599
design change

181
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,280
drastically shifted the way people

182
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,919
interact it replaced the front porch

183
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,280
where people would congregate

184
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,240
be visible be social and keep an eye on

185
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,360
the neighborhood

186
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,599
we sacrificed all that for the perceived

187
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,599
needs of our cars

188
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,919
the front-facing garage continues to

189
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,759
shape a huge part of our daily

190
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,039
interactions

191
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,800
or the or lack thereof

192
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,680
communication media is doing something

193
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
similar it is replacing

194
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,720
in-person interactions how many of us

195
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,599
have seen

196
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,080
couples at a nice dinner staring at

197
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
their phones the entire time

198
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,479
actively allowing software to collect

199
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,080
information about the dinner

200
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
they're not actually having actively

201
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,120
allowing the machine to use them

202
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,039
how often are we more concerned about

203
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,560
taking a picture and then enjoying the

204
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,759
view

205
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,520
or of our food or the people around us

206
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,879
we are killing being of the moment

207
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,120
we are killing passion we are becoming

208
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,160
predictable

209
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,879
programmable we are becoming more like

210
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,640
the machine

211
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,719
facebook twitter zoom facetime all allow

212
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,958
us to have relationships online

213
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,279
even with people we've never met they

214
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,200
allow us to keep up with family and

215
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,839
friends

216
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,560
that are far away obviously it's not

217
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,519
black and white

218
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,760
after all i am taking part in this i am

219
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
participating in hackers congress

220
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,320
remotely

221
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
over media communication and i would not

222
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
be able to speak this year

223
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,120
if i could not do it remotely but

224
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,279
media communication ironically has

225
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,680
various isolating effects

226
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,920
too often it does not supplement our

227
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,120
relationships

228
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
but instead replaces them

229
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,640
if you are very shy and anxious and the

230
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,480
internet allows you to have a community

231
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,040
without

232
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,760
ever leaving your house is it improving

233
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,560
your life

234
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,640
or is it replacing the opportunity for a

235
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,839
real community

236
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,839
or real friends

237
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
if you have a grandparent living enough

238
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,279
living a few hours away

239
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,360
is calling them a wonderful thing or is

240
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,440
the ability to call them excusing you

241
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,480
from having to go see them as much

242
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,560
or what about a dying relative in a

243
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,320
hospital that has coveted

244
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
is it a blessing that you are able to

245
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
zoom with them before they die

246
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,360
or is it a way to make it more

247
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
acceptable for you

248
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,279
when the hospital denies you visitation

249
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
rights

250
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
how many elderly people died from

251
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
neglect this summer how many babies were

252
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,080
born this year

253
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
that haven't been held by anyone except

254
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
their parents

255
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
how many people watched a funeral a

256
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,839
wedding a birthday

257
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,279
over video chat this year is this

258
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,320
a temporary measure or are we now more

259
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
tolerant of abandonment

260
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,800
neglect and hostage situations because

261
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
we can see each other on screens

262
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,160
are we tolerating more and more control

263
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,240
is this technology empowering us

264
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
or is it pacifying us

265
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,160
we have recently learned that the

266
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,000
consumption of porn

267
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
rewires our brains there are studies

268
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,480
after studies that show this

269
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,200
but some of us already knew this porn is

270
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,120
a weapon and it was used as a weapon

271
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,240
before any such studies came out

272
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,920
apart from burning out your dopamine

273
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,440
dopamine receptors and such

274
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,800
porn is a great demolar uh demolorizer

275
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,000
demoralizer and pacifier

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,560
when israel would take over towns in

277
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,360
palestine

278
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
like the town of ramallah they would

279
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
start broadcasting

280
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,360
porn onto its captive citizens as means

281
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,839
of subverting them

282
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,160
today porn consumption is at an all-time

283
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,240
high we are reached inside of our own

284
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,720
homes

285
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,680
with no friction and no resistance do we

286
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,000
just

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,560
not notice all the negative effects how

288
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
is that possible

289
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,880
well if you grow up on the internet it

290
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,959
is likely you grew up on porn

291
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,079
and your brain grew with it you were

292
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,920
used and shaped by the graphic images

293
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,560
you viewed

294
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,959
you had zero reference point especially

295
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,720
if you were a kid

296
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,560
there was no concept of good and evil

297
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,399
there was only how often

298
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,519
and which website it changes your brain

299
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,800
which changes your mood

300
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
your behavior it steals your time makes

301
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,399
you less productive

302
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,360
and less interested in actual intimacy

303
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,079
but it's more sinister than that

304
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,760
today we have a society where porn is

305
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,079
more real than actual sex

306
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,680
more people consume porn than

307
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,760
participate in intercourse

308
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,160
and when you when they do have sex they

309
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
act out what they saw in porn

310
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,320
which are often things of a degrading

311
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
and violent nature

312
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,560
and this is happening at a younger and

313
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
younger age

314
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,800
this is what baudrillard called the

315
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,839
hyper real

316
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,720
something fake the simulation of sex is

317
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,240
acted out in real life

318
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
to the point of being indistinguishable

319
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,680
from real life

320
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,040
one of the most basic human things sex

321
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
no longer comes from within us but is

322
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,079
taught to us

323
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,719
by the machine

324
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,800
the innocuous sounding screen time is

325
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,040
making kids less human

326
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,079
we have these networks called neuron

327
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,480
mirror neurons that enable us at a very

328
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,720
young age to mimic facial expressions

329
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,360
by which we develop empathy long-term

330
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,399
pacifier use

331
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,399
has been shown to restrict empathy and

332
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,480
develop in the development of boys

333
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
this is because when a little boy is

334
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,720
sucking in a pacifier all the time

335
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,639
he cannot properly mimic the facial

336
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,480
expressions of others

337
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,440
this stuns his ability to empathize now

338
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,000
imagine

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,519
a whole generation of kids who are

340
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,680
staring at screens constantly

341
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,600
we see this at parks and playdates

342
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,360
around family

343
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,200
the children are glued to flat moving

344
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,519
images instead of physically playing

345
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,680
their movements are guided by the touch

346
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,639
screens

347
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,079
and their mind is transfixed time spent

348
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,839
on a screen is time spent away from

349
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,200
family friends

350
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:35,680
and away from eye contact

351
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,000
there may also be advertising but even

352
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,040
if there isn't

353
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
they're still gathering information and

354
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
how your child interacts with the device

355
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
the app the video your kid is the

356
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
product and unlike you

357
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,959
they had no choice

358
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,240
then there's the issue of content do we

359
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,720
all remember the youtube kids scandal

360
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
parents would allow their kids to freely

361
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,000
explore youtube on

362
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,199
the kids setting assuming this

363
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,480
technology cared about your kids enough

364
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,839
to make sure they could only see

365
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,240
safe content but as it turns out they

366
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,519
don't care

367
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,959
at all in fact the content was arguably

368
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,079
worse than anything

369
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,160
i've ever accidentally stumbled upon

370
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,839
regular youtube

371
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,839
channel farms in places like spain india

372
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,519
russia were putting out dystopic and

373
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,040
quite horrifying videos

374
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,480
made by ais targeted at kids all for

375
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
views

376
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,760
there were themes of violence rape

377
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,959
kidnapping injury

378
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,560
all done by your kids favorite

379
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,360
superheroes and disney characters

380
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,760
there were also channels run by ex porn

381
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,000
stars which may explain some of the

382
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,839
more sexual themes

383
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
even if youtube kids only had good

384
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,680
content

385
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,519
giving a small child the power to watch

386
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,600
short videos on demand is incredibly

387
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,959
over stimulating

388
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,560
and rewires the brain in a similar

389
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
fashion as poor does in adults

390
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,839
it decreases the ability to pay

391
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,600
attention which decreases the ability to

392
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
memorize

393
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,040
and again it replaces human interaction

394
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,360
all of this was viewed as hysterics but

395
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,959
now the studies are coming out and they

396
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,120
are not telling us anything that wasn't

397
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,720
already reasonable to assume

398
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,160
something i find to be revealing is that

399
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
many people who are incredibly tech

400
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,199
savvy

401
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,199
the very people that make the technology

402
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,240
the majority of us

403
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
use tend to interact with it cautiously

404
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,440
they make sure to spend enough time off

405
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,759
the computer some go as far as to

406
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,519
severely limit the time the children

407
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,040
spend on devices

408
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,120
not long ago the restrictive attitudes

409
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
of tech ceos like corporations like

410
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,600
apple and google made news

411
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,360
they revealed that in their home

412
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
smartphone news smartphone news was

413
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,759
discouraged and even outright banned

414
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,600
some silicon valley elites specifically

415
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,959
picked device free

416
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,479
private schools for their children

417
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
after nietzsche became progressively

418
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,399
more sick he ordered a typewriter so he

419
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,079
could keep working

420
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,920
after writing some letters to his friend

421
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,839
heinrich kozilitz

422
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,360
the friend remarked how nietzsche's

423
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,959
writing has become tighter

424
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,600
telegraphic and more forceful like the

425
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
iron of the machine

426
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,600
as though as though the typewriter

427
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,519
itself was metaphysically transferred

428
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,680
onto the page nietzsche went on to say

429
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
our writing equipment takes part in the

430
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,880
forming of our thoughts

431
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,720
next time you use a computer or phone

432
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,560
remember that the very act

433
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,040
changes the way you operate next time

434
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,199
you consume information online

435
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,199
remember that it consumes you

436
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,480
the digital totality is upon us but it's

437
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,560
not something we can be ready for

438
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,399
it's not something that is happening to

439
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,800
us it's something that is happening

440
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,440
with us machines are not becoming more

441
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,640
human-like

442
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,280
it is humans that are becoming more more

443
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,319
machine-like

444
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,359
and the dangerous machines don't know

445
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:18,799
right from wrong

446
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,760
okay thank you for hearing me talk

447
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,640
thank you so much

448
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,320
[Applause]

449
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,720
that was super interesting um i really

450
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
appreciate all the different themes that

451
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,280
came up there

452
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,960
um i've actually got a few questions but

453
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,720
i want to um leave it to the audience to

454
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,520
ask any

455
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,039
um do you guys have any questions for

456
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,440
julia

457
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
any questions okay i've got one um

458
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,440
my question is we you talk about um the

459
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,080
obvious cognitive effects that um

460
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,679
using different types of technology can

461
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,200
have on the human brain

462
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,880
where do you think that the state comes

463
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,559
into this um

464
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
because obviously a lot of this is at

465
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
least like we perceive it as free will

466
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,000
that i buy a phone so that i can talk to

467
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,039
my grandmother

468
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,480
but where do you think that the line is

469
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
drawn between kind of individual choice

470
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,520
when it comes to using these

471
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,120
technologies and then the state

472
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,720
imposing them and then potentially

473
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
collectively changing the mindset of a

474
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,280
society

475
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,559
well today the state and large

476
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,559
corporations are

477
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,960
they work together and they supplement

478
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,000
each other

479
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,600
and i think the role of the corporation

480
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,080
and the um like the free mark which we

481
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,000
don't have a free market but

482
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,919
even in a free market this would be

483
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,440
problematic

484
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
um people think they're opting into

485
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,520
things but like i said

486
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,480
if you grew up on the internet from

487
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,720
being a young kid

488
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
you are raised on that medium and

489
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,840
the messaging that goes through that

490
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,160
medium

491
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,840
that is not something you can

492
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,480
voluntarily like pick and choose between

493
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,160
you can't just filter out the good

494
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,640
information from the bad information

495
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,320
or the good programming from the bad

496
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
programming especially when you're very

497
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,440
young

498
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,600
so i mean the obvious example here is

499
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,360
all media is um all the media

500
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,080
that is very prevalent is at the end of

501
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,480
the day

502
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
empowered by the government because they

503
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,600
can message through that media

504
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,640
like look at any election and i think

505
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,559
um there was a previous talk where he

506
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,320
talked where he said that

507
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,640
this was always like this so since the

508
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
emergence of the printing

509
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,799
press people had the most money and most

510
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,559
influence got the most information out

511
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,600
there

512
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,640
today it is more flat so you do have

513
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,760
more choice but you're still going to be

514
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,880
exposed to the preferable information

515
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,520
because

516
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,919
if you're using any kind of social media

517
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,799
that is what gets

518
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,440
bumped up and um we obviously we can

519
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,880
talk about censorship and many

520
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
speakers have talked about that as well

521
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,120
but my main point would be

522
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,640
that these kinds of powers become

523
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,919
they merge together too they're

524
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,640
indistinguishable and a lot of their

525
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,679
goals are aligned and we are

526
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,799
again we're not like we're not um

527
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,440
voluntary consumers like they reach us

528
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
in our homes

529
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,440
and we have an illusion of choice which

530
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,720
is so much worse than

531
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
actually having the choice um

532
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,720
and you can't you can't even like you

533
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,679
can't even

534
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,640
pick a point where that happens because

535
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,159
i grow up online

536
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,159
and i'm just used to doing things a

537
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,480
certain way and we all become extensions

538
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,039
of our computers and of our

539
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,559
anything that we write online or do

540
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,960
online and i'm sure many of you who are

541
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,159
my age

542
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,159
probably regret a lot of things you did

543
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,400
online growing up because you didn't

544
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,919
realize what you were doing and you

545
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,440
didn't realize how it affected you in

546
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,559
the long term of what

547
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,918
what repercussions it could have

548
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,400
that's brilliant thank you very much um

549
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
ah there is a follow-up question i'm not

550
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,240
sure that the microphone can reach you

551
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,440
so you might need to

552
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
come this way

553
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,640
hello hi

554
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,640
hello there i'm here i'll come here

555
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
oh sorry i apologize you don't need to

556
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
see me do you um you can see i've got

557
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,760
gray hair

558
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,679
and i'm actually responsible this

559
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,159
generation is responsible for what

560
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,360
my daughter of 25 and of course you

561
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,799
look about the same age um uh

562
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,720
we are responsible for what is happening

563
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,159
today so

564
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,919
what i've i understand a lot of what

565
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,200
you're saying and i agree with a lot of

566
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,320
what you're saying

567
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,919
the problem i've got is what is the

568
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,840
solution

569
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,039
what is the way that we the negative

570
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:49,679
elements

571
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,120
of what is what is happening are um

572
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,960
prevented preventing are prevented from

573
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,360
stopping the next generations

574
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,320
difficulties

575
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,039
because you know i'm a i'm an englishman

576
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,720
i live in prague and this is my home

577
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,320
i've lived here for seven years now and

578
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
i want to continue here

579
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
in the uk children i don't know if

580
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,000
you've been to the uk in the last um

581
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,880
what 10 years or so in the uk the

582
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,760
children

583
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,440
are being being educated in prisons

584
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,080
this is not a joke okay i have many i

585
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,919
have i have been and visited many times

586
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,360
i have to go there every two months

587
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,880
until recently and um

588
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,799
they can't even get out of the classroom

589
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,240
to go to the toilet without putting a

590
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,679
pin code in there

591
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,080
this is a whole society and a whole

592
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,120
generation

593
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,679
that is being supposedly educated on

594
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,240
technology

595
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
they're not they're being given the

596
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,919
tablets the screens

597
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,559
and they just left to do it so the

598
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,760
problem i've got is

599
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
nobody's coming up with the solutions

600
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,200
you know i'm the one who should have

601
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,000
created

602
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,679
an artificial um uh phd or whatever you

603
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,559
like to call it

604
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,440
which says that any mobile phone that is

605
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,960
used by a ten-year-old

606
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,520
um one cent one one millimeter from

607
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,960
there from their brain

608
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,679
uh should be banned is you know that's

609
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,640
the sort of

610
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,880
solution that i should have come up with

611
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,840
to stop

612
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,640
the effects of the radiation to a young

613
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,320
child's head by a mobile phone

614
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,760
happening so what i'm saying is i'm

615
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,520
sorry i'm taking a bit of time but i

616
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,280
hope i'm being understood

617
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,520
um in some way is there a solution to

618
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,640
this

619
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,480
i'm sorry i apologize for taking so much

620
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,000
time

621
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,280
no not at all thank you um

622
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,039
yeah and exactly and especially with

623
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,880
covid now i touched on this with you

624
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,159
know allowing your

625
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,840
relatives to die in the hospital alone

626
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,360
and it's okay because you saw them on

627
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,080
zoom

628
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,520
the same thing is happening with kids

629
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,679
now oh they're on zoom they're learning

630
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,120
they're sitting in front of a screen for

631
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,720
eight hours a day

632
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,400
at home and now they're trying to

633
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,840
integrate them back into the classrooms

634
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,679
but a lot of schools aren't

635
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,799
um and you can't you cannot teach a

636
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,840
child

637
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,120
a small child to read or write or do

638
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,520
math

639
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,760
basic math over zoom you cannot do it

640
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,960
especially with boys you have to sit

641
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,400
down and teach them you have to

642
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,679
have physicality present

643
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,480
so we're going to have a whole

644
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
generation of basically illiterate kids

645
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,320
starting to grow up unless the parents

646
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,960
step in

647
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,880
and that is my solution because you

648
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,000
cannot you cannot

649
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,720
limit the staff like from a top-down way

650
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,600
like unless

651
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,880
the government literally bans the

652
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,960
internet which i do not advocate for

653
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,039
at all i do not advocate for banning

654
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,000
technology or

655
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,520
putting laws in place it has to start at

656
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,120
home and it has to start from

657
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,679
an objective set of morality so that is

658
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,120
my point here like

659
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,960
if we're becoming more machine-like and

660
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
we're integrated with all of this stuff

661
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,919
machines do not have they do not know

662
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,640
right from wrong and we cannot base our

663
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,480
morality on like

664
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,240
the uh pr firms of global corporations

665
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,440
like what they say because their

666
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,520
morality changes every five minutes and

667
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,640
that's kind of

668
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,360
uh how what you can or cannot do or

669
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,039
cannot say online that is where that's

670
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,080
coming from

671
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
um the government is actually less

672
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,760
relevant with that in a lot of ways

673
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,279
because

674
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,440
we use the things on the internet more

675
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,960
than we interact with the government

676
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,279
that's what's shaping our kids so it

677
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,080
starts at home

678
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,799
and like i can give very pragmatic

679
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,799
advice how to turn this around

680
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,200
at least for your own family and the

681
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,919
problem is when not enough people do it

682
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,440
it's very difficult because your

683
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,240
children are shaped by the peer group so

684
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,080
a lot of the tech people who are very

685
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,679
into tech like even bitcoin

686
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,919
core developers that i know they have

687
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,960
kids

688
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,559
the kids do not have their personal

689
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,000
devices at all they don't even have

690
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,640
personal

691
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,120
uh online devices the computers are in a

692
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,960
public space within the home

693
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,880
um it's not that they're monitoring

694
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,159
monitoring them like

695
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,080
sitting behind them the whole time but

696
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,840
it's it's understood that

697
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,400
no this is not something you can just do

698
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,760
whatever you want on there are

699
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,279
limitations

700
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,919
limiting the time spent online making

701
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:58,480
sure

702
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,880
children are having physical contact

703
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,960
with other children and other people

704
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,320
making sure you're sitting down and

705
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,799
educating your children i go as far as

706
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,360
to

707
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,960
especially right now to say homeschool

708
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,720
your kids uh

709
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,799
because if i was a if i was a woman and

710
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,720
my children i am a woman but if i was a

711
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,880
woman in the position

712
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,919
where my children were school age

713
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,919
and i had a full-time job i would quit

714
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,279
my job and i would stay at home with

715
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,000
them and

716
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,159
teach them because to send them to a

717
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,840
prison like you described

718
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,240
the school system currently i don't

719
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,880
think

720
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,000
that's a good um way to assess

721
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,960
long-term outcomes like don't don't do

722
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,480
that if you can help it

723
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
so it starts at home it starts with what

724
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,760
is your

725
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,960
fundamental objective morality and how

726
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,520
do you

727
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,679
uh and everything starts from there

728
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,440
thank you so much um any more questions

729
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,919
because i have one more but um i want to

730
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:56,720
give you guys

731
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,919
a chance to ask as well 15 minutes cool

732
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,840
right fine i'll i'll ask as well um so

733
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,000
you you mentioned and i i agree with you

734
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,159
that um a lot of people who work in tech

735
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,679
are actually the ones to limit

736
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,200
the way that they use tech in the first

737
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,120
place in their homes or like in their

738
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,919
private lives but at the same time um

739
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,960
like the friendships and the

740
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,880
relationships that these children foster

741
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,799
are often only done through technology

742
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,720
like not not only obviously not

743
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,600
exclusively

744
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,679
but they help them enrich their lives in

745
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,960
the sense that they can become friends

746
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,840
with people from

747
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,200
other cultures that are eight thousand

748
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,039
miles away and things like that

749
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,200
um and it's not ideal i realize that a

750
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,799
lot of that is obviously um

751
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,720
has to be carefully curated but what is

752
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,919
your opinion on

753
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,320
not ostracizing the kids from society by

754
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,240
like removing them from this digital

755
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,919
sphere but at the same time protecting

756
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:44,480
them

757
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,399
as rightly you said by homeschooling

758
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,600
them and giving them that extra

759
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,520
physicality and attention that they need

760
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,720
um again where do you think that the

761
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,360
line lies here

762
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,240
yeah i just did a talk specifically on

763
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,039
this topic

764
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,279
um at a guns and bitcoin conference like

765
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,559
two weeks ago

766
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,399
and i talk about 100 community oriented

767
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,039
living so i'm not saying like live in a

768
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,360
commune i'm saying

769
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,679
pick a place to set your roots and make

770
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,279
sure your friends

771
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,880
move there or move to a place where your

772
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
friends and family are who all think

773
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,360
similar

774
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,919
to you because i'll give you an example

775
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,200
my my son has

776
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
a name a neighbor and she's a little

777
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,240
girl

778
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,919
and they're like best friends and um

779
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,720
their family is not allowing them to

780
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,080
play together without like

781
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,440
a pool noodle a six-foot pool noodle in

782
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,960
between them and she wears a mask the

783
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,159
whole time

784
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,320
and my son had one interaction like this

785
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,080
with her and came back fearful and

786
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,720
didn't want to meet new people

787
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,240
so i don't want him to have friends like

788
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,640
that

789
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,120
because that influences my son in a

790
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,200
negative way

791
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,480
and i also don't want to prohibit that

792
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,039
because that's his friend but so the

793
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,159
long-term solution

794
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,960
is make sure he has friends that don't

795
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,520
put

796
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,640
a six foot long pool noodle in between

797
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,559
in between them when they play that is

798
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,080
what you have to do so

799
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,799
we are uh we we've set roots on some

800
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,440
land

801
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
and we are actively encouraging our

802
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
friends to move close to us

803
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,039
uh some have and some of them are having

804
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,520
kids

805
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,840
and i'm also actively seeking out other

806
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,880
children around

807
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,679
that have similar long-term goals as we

808
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,240
do

809
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,520
and that way your kid isn't missing out

810
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,559
on anything

811
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,640
by having these limitations on whether

812
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,320
it's technology or

813
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,159
playing with people who are really

814
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,360
scared and

815
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,559
fearful of the world so that's what you

816
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,840
have to do

817
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,320
and the little girl i talked to her and

818
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,960
i was just

819
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,799
casually asking her what she did all

820
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,799
summer how school going

821
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,760
she's almost seven she literally sat all

822
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,679
summer on the computer playing

823
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,880
animal crossing she didn't learn

824
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
anything because

825
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,039
i asked and we tried to do some math and

826
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,679
some writing and she can't do any of it

827
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,679
her mother is a teacher and her mother

828
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,279
didn't bother sitting down with her all

829
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,120
summer to do these things to teach her

830
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,559
own daughter

831
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,840
and she literally said to me i'm very

832
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,720
lonely

833
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,640
i want my mom to get an ultrasound to

834
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,039
see if i can have a little baby

835
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,320
and it broke my heart but this is the

836
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,360
state of the world

837
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,080
and i don't really want my son

838
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,120
experiencing

839
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
things that are that heartbreaking in my

840
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
opinion so i suggest

841
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,840
having a community and building it and

842
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,039
growing it because that's the only way

843
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,240
you're gonna do it

844
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,399
and then at an age appropriate time of

845
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,080
course you can introduce

846
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,760
certain aspects of uh being online

847
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,080
and the machine of course you can

848
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,440
utilize things

849
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,640
in a more positive way when the child

850
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,120
uh is more ready for it and when you can

851
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,200
have a reasonable conversation about

852
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,919
the negative aspects of all this stuff

853
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,360
awesome thank you so much i actually

854
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,760
have a

855
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
follow-up question on this um regarding

856
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,360
um if you don't mind me asking schooling

857
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,159
your son

858
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,640
um do you have a specific um system in

859
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,200
place like

860
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,279
is there any technology that you use to

861
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,880
maybe augment that or

862
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,440
um how do you approach this whole thing

863
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,320
can you repeat

864
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,840
the question because you froze right

865
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,519
when you asked it sure

866
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,640
can you can you hear me yes yeah no i'm

867
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,600
just curious about

868
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,360
if it's not too personal a question

869
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,200
about how you actually school your uh

870
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,279
your son whether you do use some kind of

871
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,799
blend of technology or whether you have

872
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,600
a very unique

873
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,919
like approach that you just described

874
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,279
it's just i'm just curious about a

875
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,480
little bit more detail it sounds really

876
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,760
interesting

877
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,960
sure i'm not a lady like um i love video

878
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,320
games still like my husband and i are

879
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,399
both into that like we understand

880
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,679
uh that it's not fair to just completely

881
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,200
take everything away

882
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,000
my rule for my son is if he's getting

883
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,600
emotional about

884
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,360
a video game or watching a movie then

885
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,039
he cannot um that is an that is an

886
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,919
unhealthy relationship beginning so if

887
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,519
i'm noticing that he's getting emotional

888
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,039
about something i say okay we're gonna

889
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,559
not do this for a little while and we'll

890
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,679
come back to it

891
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,600
and when he gets to a point where he's

892
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,799
not like

893
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,399
wanting it all the time or getting

894
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,799
emotional when he doesn't have it

895
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,480
that's like the key that's what you want

896
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,399
and we're at that point with him he's

897
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,320
he's only four so he gets to play a

898
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,159
video game here and there and it's like

899
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,840
a fun reward and like

900
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,679
you know at the end of the day he can do

901
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,840
that um i try to limit it to

902
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,919
we don't even do it every day an hour

903
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,600
every other day

904
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,360
even less when we have a lot of stuff

905
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,279
going on and in terms of education he's

906
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,640
still quite young but

907
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,600
we're bilingual so i'm just educating

908
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:43,919
him

909
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,880
in um russian uh every day he does

910
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,440
lessons

911
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,480
he does rep writing he does uh basic

912
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,519
um combinations of sounds to start him

913
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:53,840
on

914
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,640
reading and he does he's doing like

915
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,960
double digit math with tables now

916
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,440
and honestly it's not hard they're so

917
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,799
young all you have to do is teach the

918
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,760
math and reading

919
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,360
and you just sit with sit down with them

920
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,039
for an hour at a time and do it

921
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,039
you don't even need a curriculum once

922
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,880
they hit like 678

923
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,039
then a curriculum would be helpful more

924
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,919
for the

925
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,559
parents and there's like so many you can

926
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,000
choose from

927
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,120
and i highly suggest you don't use apps

928
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,279
because what happens with apps is

929
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,640
they're smart okay

930
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,600
they will um hack they will hack the app

931
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:27,919
like

932
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,960
they'll so some apps will have answer

933
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,159
questions and answers

934
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,760
and they'll realize you can just like

935
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,440
try all the answers until you get it

936
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,120
right and then it's fun for them to just

937
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,640
get it right every time so they're not

938
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,159
actually learning what they're doing so

939
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:40,640
i

940
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,559
i do not recommend apps for very young

941
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,320
children at all

942
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,480
especially in terms of writing apps i

943
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,039
have a preschool teacher

944
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,600
preschool first grade and she had

945
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,080
teacher

946
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,000
she had parents come to them and be like

947
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,320
why can't my son hold a pencil

948
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
like he can write everything on his ipad

949
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,760
and she's like

950
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,360
this is different than this

951
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
and that's like a whole pro different

952
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,880
problem with kids they can't even hold a

953
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,239
pencil to write like

954
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,159
basic letters not even cursive i won't

955
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,918
even start on cursive

956
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,599
um they can't even hold a pencil because

957
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,280
it's a different motor skill

958
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,199
they're just poking and dragging things

959
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,560
that's different

960
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,440
so i would really like i would not even

961
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,599
give your kid an ipad until

962
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,918
a road trip when they're like six i

963
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,599
wouldn't do it because it starts it

964
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,879
cascades a whole bunch of problems

965
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,199
thank you very much yes there seems to

966
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,399
be a follow-up question

967
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,079
yeah sorry it's just this is a bit of a

968
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,879
short chord

969
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,440
hello again it's uh um i'll give you

970
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,480
a example two examples of what uh i

971
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,960
and my ex-wife did with um uh our

972
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,839
daughter

973
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,159
um and don't forget this was what she's

974
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,599
25 now so this was

975
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,280
uh 13 years ago and we were able to do

976
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,920
it then

977
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,560
uh with education and we we understood

978
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,200
many many things the first thing we did

979
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,560
it was i found a a router which had a

980
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,680
little bit of serve

981
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,079
a little bit of software in it and it

982
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,440
was quite unique

983
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,160
that router allowed me to restrict the

984
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,599
time that the

985
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,720
internet was on and off it also

986
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,760
restricted me

987
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,440
allowed me to um identify

988
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,880
individual ip addresses and to set times

989
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,599
on and off days of the week etc etc

990
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,359
so the first thing we did was we said

991
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,040
well there's absolutely no way

992
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,200
that anybody especially a 10 year old

993
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,119
let alone a 13 year old

994
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,160
needs the internet after midnight

995
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,720
and before six o'clock in the morning so

996
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,640
the whole thing went off

997
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,960
now the first i'll give you example what

998
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,680
happened

999
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,800
the first day that happened um uh

1000
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,280
it happened and of course um our

1001
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,000
daughter

1002
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,760
uh came in to the bedroom

1003
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,599
and said you've just turned off the

1004
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,119
internet

1005
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,480
now one of the great things about

1006
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,599
third parties is that you can blame them

1007
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,040
and if they're invisible then the child

1008
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,160
especially

1009
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,160
can't have a little tantrum at them

1010
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,920
can't pull their hair can't jump and

1011
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,000
up and down and can't do anything at

1012
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,160
them so i said i'm terribly sorry i

1013
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,440
haven't done anything

1014
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,359
i've just bought this this software and

1015
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,200
it's just worked

1016
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,960
and i'm terribly sorry i can't do

1017
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,640
anything about it that's it you see

1018
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,280
that's the role of a parent in my view

1019
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,240
not a friend

1020
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,359
a parent and somebody who cares so she

1021
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,560
just accepted that

1022
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,640
because there was nobody she couldn't

1023
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,720
get at me she couldn't get him my wife

1024
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,800
anything else like and she was her life

1025
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,839
was exactly

1026
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,160
that way and she was perfectly happy

1027
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,920
with that and once your friends came

1028
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,880
round

1029
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,280
no problem at all the other part of it

1030
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,520
was the media of the television

1031
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,920
so this was this was a unique piece of

1032
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,680
piece of software

1033
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,720
and what it did it it stands between the

1034
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,280
the

1035
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,359
the um what's it called the infrared

1036
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,440
remote sorry i don't have a television i

1037
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,960
haven't had one for 14 years

1038
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
the infrared remote television that

1039
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,320
doesn't mean i'm boring by the way

1040
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,160
or don't know what's going on in fact

1041
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,520
the opposite

1042
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,520
and it stands between that and the tv

1043
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,599
and what it does is it creates a barrier

1044
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,400
between

1045
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,680
yourself the user and the tv and what it

1046
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,079
did

1047
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,640
is we set up very simply accounts for

1048
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,760
each one of us

1049
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,800
and we then set up time scales that we

1050
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,760
could then say

1051
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
we wanted or especially the child it was

1052
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,599
particularly that for the child

1053
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,280
i didn't need to control my wife and she

1054
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,880
didn't need to control me that's a bit

1055
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,160
of a joke by the way

1056
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,400
um and but basically what we were doing

1057
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,040
because we also had the same

1058
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,320
restrictions

1059
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,599
that made it fair to all three of us and

1060
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,920
so what happened was that she was then

1061
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,960
allowed

1062
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,119
every day let's assume to watch the

1063
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,119
television between let's say six o'clock

1064
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,320
at eight o'clock or something like that

1065
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,200
i don't remember

1066
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,960
whatever the whatever the hours were

1067
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,720
before she went to bed

1068
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
and what happened and and it was a time

1069
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,800
scale and what happened

1070
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,760
was that she became very very very

1071
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,480
discerning

1072
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
and very it taught her a lot of things

1073
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,000
because what it taught her

1074
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,400
is that she had two hours with watch to

1075
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,839
what which to watch that media

1076
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,920
even if she had two hours within a four

1077
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,200
or five hour scope

1078
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,119
of time that she was allowed what she

1079
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,320
did is

1080
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,880
she looked at what the programs were on

1081
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,240
each of the channels

1082
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,800
and she made a decision a conscious

1083
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,599
decision

1084
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,280
what she was going to watch and what she

1085
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,960
didn't watch

1086
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,119
and that was really good education for

1087
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,079
her and

1088
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,000
something she didn't get then the

1089
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,640
greatest benefit of all because some of

1090
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,000
the channels were commercial

1091
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,960
with adverts what then happened

1092
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,119
especially with her friends were around

1093
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,079
what then happened was she realized that

1094
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,760
the time she wanted to watch the things

1095
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,200
that she wanted to watch and her friends

1096
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,640
wanted to watch

1097
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,400
they were being it was being it was

1098
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,480
being used by these crap adverts

1099
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,880
that were no use to her so she was what

1100
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,400
she used to happen when the adverts used

1101
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,040
to come on

1102
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,240
she turned the tv off to save the time

1103
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,119
then turned it back on again so those

1104
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,400
are two examples

1105
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,079
that you may not have heard of before i

1106
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,240
don't know i don't control

1107
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,560
i don't i don't i call those that both

1108
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,680
of those elements

1109
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,079
caring and being a parent for your

1110
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,760
daughter or for your child for the

1111
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,480
future

1112
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,520
and so i i wish those two things would

1113
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,480
be part of

1114
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,400
virtually everybody's society personally

1115
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,760
but it's a parent's decision i

1116
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,480
understand

1117
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,560
so i don't know whether i don't have any

1118
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,599
comments whether you said

1119
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,280
i'm being i don't know um a communist or

1120
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,079
something like that

1121
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,200
i'm not of course okay sorry

1122
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,320
um yeah i'm gonna just i'm gonna end on

1123
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,839
saying that you have to have fundamental

1124
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,680
objective morality in your home

1125
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,560
and media is not outside of that it has

1126
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,119
to be

1127
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,400
adhering to the same basic

1128
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,000
moral principles that you're teaching

1129
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,599
your kids at home

1130
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,079
so a lot of parents i've even seen this

1131
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,599
with homeschooling

1132
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,200
fundamental religious parents

1133
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,040
they have a certain set of values for

1134
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,720
everything except

1135
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
media and they'll just stick their kids

1136
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,880
on an ipad even if they're homeschooling

1137
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,400
them

1138
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,280
i think that's missing the mark and if

1139
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,400
you guys want

1140
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,760
more of the morality side perspective i

1141
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,960
have a playlist

1142
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,520
on my channel called it's the religion

1143
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,280
playlist and i talk about objective

1144
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,800
morality and

1145
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,599
how to um how to navigate through that

1146
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,680
if you're interested but that's

1147
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,960
i didn't talk too much about that

1148
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
because that's its own speech

1149
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,000
um but yeah have your moral

1150
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,839
foundation at home and as long as you're

1151
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,400
consistent

1152
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,920
uh your children will not tantrum or

1153
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,560
like try to uh work around it the

1154
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,680
consistency

1155
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,839
is what is what keeps the tantrums at

1156
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,400
bay if you're flip-flopping and they

1157
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
they can manipulate you and get around

1158
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
the kids are very smart they will try

1159
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,359
everything

1160
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,520
but if you're consistent they will not

1161
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,640
try it because

1162
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,960
they know that um there's a foundation

1163
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,000
that cannot be

1164
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,960
breached this is awesome and i think

1165
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,760
it's one of the

1166
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,599
beauties of multidisciplinarity that you

1167
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,880
come to a um

1168
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,119
crypto anarchic congress and actually

1169
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,240
pick up a lot of

1170
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,280
cool tips on parenting so i'm i'm very

1171
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,800
excited about that um

1172
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,880
i've got maybe one last question because

1173
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,079
the theme of this congress

1174
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,720
is digital totality and i'm just curious

1175
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,240
whether we take the metaphor of the

1176
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,079
parent-child relationship and we bring

1177
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,280
it towards the state

1178
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,880
and the population and the use of

1179
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,319
technologies um

1180
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,000
again like what is your view on that

1181
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,680
whether you see any parallels um and

1182
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,079
whether

1183
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,599
from your line of work you've got some

1184
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,359
experience that you'd like to share or

1185
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,720
any comments that you'd like to make on

1186
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,400
that front

1187
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,160
well unlike parents who are hopefully

1188
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,880
actually care about their children uh

1189
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,000
the state

1190
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,880
does not especially the current forms of

1191
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,520
government

1192
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,119
they're based on short-term um democracy

1193
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,319
so all politicians care about is serving

1194
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,040
their

1195
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,920
you know short time in the government

1196
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,440
they want the votes for that

1197
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,480
and they'll only be concerned about the

1198
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,280
high time preference results they want

1199
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,640
the things to look

1200
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,760
and sound and feel good and beneficial

1201
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,480
and positive

1202
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
for the people in the short term so that

1203
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,400
they can keep their power

1204
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,319
and when everything explodes down the

1205
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,000
line it's not their problem anymore and

1206
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,880
they don't care

1207
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,760
and the system in it of itself is

1208
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,280
structured that way

1209
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,880
um and this is why i'm still a huge

1210
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,040
advocate of bitcoin because

1211
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,119
you know fiat money is a perfect example

1212
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,920
of this fiat money is a short-term

1213
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,280
system that benefits those in power um

1214
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,839
i am i'm i'm co-authoring a book about

1215
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,520
how bitcoin is the most moral money and

1216
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,560
we go into this

1217
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,839
uh very much in depth and anytime you

1218
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,920
have a system where the government

1219
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,680
only cares about high time preference

1220
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,040
and short-term outcomes

1221
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,480
you're not going to have a good system

1222
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,839
and they don't actually care about what

1223
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,599
happens to you down the line

1224
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,680
so keep that in mind whether as a parent

1225
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,880
a parent child relationship you do

1226
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,720
care about your children down the line

1227
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,920
that is the most

1228
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,079
low time preference you can a thing you

1229
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,240
can do in your life because

1230
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,960
it takes a lot of time and energy and

1231
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,720
resources from you

1232
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,200
and you're investing into your future

1233
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,680
generations that you will never even see

1234
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,480
so i like to apply that mindset for

1235
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,760
everything in my life

1236
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,440
and um this is why democracy uh is bad

1237
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,079
and um i think we should bring back a

1238
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:48,580
king

1239
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,920
[Laughter]

1240
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,240
based on moral principles so a god

1241
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,319
ordained king but

1242
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,920
you guys can harass me about that on

1243
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,280
twitter it's no time for that

1244
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,560
conversation either

1245
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,079
no i think you're in pretty good company

1246
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,000
for that um

1247
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
an objectively moral king that sounds

1248
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,040
that sounds like

1249
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,920
you can be pet him if he doesn't adhere

1250
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,520
to god's law that's the good outfit

1251
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,800
it's a good it's a good approach well

1252
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,160
maybe that's what the next congress will

1253
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,480
be about um

1254
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,079
and the future of the monarchy um who

1255
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,160
