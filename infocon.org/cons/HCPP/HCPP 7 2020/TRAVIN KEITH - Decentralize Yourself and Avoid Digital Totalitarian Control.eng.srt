1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,880
to start off

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
i'd like to read something it's not

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,240
something i normally do

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
but i think it's quite apt for this

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
citizens enjoy freedom of speech of the

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:19,920
press

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,960
of assembly and of association

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,599
citizens enjoy freedom of religious

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,199
beliefs

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,599
freedom of the person of citizens is

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,519
inviable

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,079
freedom and privacy of correspondence of

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,520
citizens are protected

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,559
by law citizens have the right to

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,120
criticize and make suggestions

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,320
regarding any state organ

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,960
these are the words of the constitution

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,600
of the

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,440
people's republic of china

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,039
so it's very interesting for me because

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,559
i come from such a world

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,120
where what is written is not necessarily

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,640
what is enforced

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,959
and so living here in europe and as paul

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,640
mentioned now in switzerland

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,320
it's very common to come across people

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,799
who say like okay no my data is now

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,439
secured

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,760
because of gdpr because of privacy

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,479
regulations

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
there is a country that shall not be

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,200
named

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,119
where if a police officer catches you

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,360
with even just a small amount of

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,119
marijuana

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,520
that officer is allowed to completely

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,159
ignore

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,119
the requirement of due process of law

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,159
take out his gun

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,119
and shoot you in the head that police

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,240
officer will then

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,280
receive a bonus

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
so on one side some people like to take

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,600
control

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,399
over just complete ignorance ignoring

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,240
whatever rules are in place

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,920
and i come from such a place and so for

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,079
me

50
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,880
just relying on regulations is

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,079
insufficient

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,320
and sometimes they even try to modify

53
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,759
the regulations

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,759
with these exemptions that they give

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,520
themselves in mind

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,720
in the exact same country last year they

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,680
have lowered

58
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,200
the age of criminal uh responsibility

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,080
to the age of 12. so police officers can

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,879
now do that to kids as young as 12.

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
if that's how much they value human life

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,080
what do you think they value privacy

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,360
it's not there's nothing for them and so

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
i decided to have this presentation

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
about decentralizing oneself i know it's

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,360
a little bit it's supposed to be a

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
workshop

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
i usually give more like talks and

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,840
inspirational speeches this is going to

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,640
be somewhere

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,000
some in between because really

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,519
as the presentation goes on you'll

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,519
realize that a lot of the things that

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,879
i'm going to give you are more of like

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,720
tools and ways to help you

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,120
understand yourselves better better

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,319
equip yourself for

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,000
what's about to become what's about to

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,480
come it's because at the end of the day

80
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,280
it really comes

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,159
to your preferences as pavel mentioned

82
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,920
i've lived in many different countries

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,519
some of these choices that i've made of

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,080
where to go were because of restrictions

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,599
that were given to me as a philippine

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,599
passport holder i can only enter visa

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,080
free

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
to 34 different countries around the

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
world that's four more than last year so

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,519
i guess it's a good thing um but also a

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,879
lot of it was just because of personal

92
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720
preference as svalbard is in the north

93
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,840
pole

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,959
probably not a lot of people would like

95
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,200
to live there

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
so again i'm from the philippines and

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,799
eventually

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
i've lived in all of these places a lot

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,480
of it was

100
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,560
fairly unintentional uh that flag there

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
again is not norway that's volvard

102
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,599
that's where it is

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,120
again very cold and something was

104
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,159
quite interesting as i lived through all

105
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,959
of this because i didn't

106
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,799
intend to decentralize myself but that's

107
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,319
what ended up happening

108
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,319
if you look me up online and really try

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,840
to find my address you will probably

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,480
find about

111
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
five to six different official addresses

112
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,120
somewhere in these areas somehow i've

113
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,159
even managed to

114
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
get a mailing address to be one of the

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,640
official addresses that i've had

116
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,519
and i realized slowly that you know a

117
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,640
lot of these things that have happened

118
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
to me and unintentionally can be quite

119
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,918
beneficial for people that are trying to

120
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,478
remain

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,160
more private other because either

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
because of security reasons you might

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,080
have somebody trying to come after you

124
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,759
especially in the cryptocurrency space

125
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,240
especially if um i've received a number

126
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
of death threats already because i maybe

127
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,040
didn't praise the project well enough

128
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,000
and so

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
the price went down and they said it's

130
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
my fault they lost money and things like

131
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,320
that

132
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,400
or just you know wanting to be more

133
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,639
secure and wanting that your information

134
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,199
out there

135
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,479
is not um that accurate

136
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,080
so it's what i like to call hiding in

137
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,240
plain sight if you look at my linkedin

138
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,160
profile you'll see a crap ton

139
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,520
of information i've put a lot of

140
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,040
information there about the courses i've

141
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,240
taken

142
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,520
the universities i've been to even the

143
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
ones that i didn't finish

144
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,560
and that's intentional because

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
then when you look at my profile if

146
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
you're a government official or somebody

147
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
who's

148
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
at the border control a lot of times i

149
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
actually cite my linkedin profile

150
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,919
whenever i try to say like yes i'm an

151
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,360
okay person please let me in your

152
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,320
country for three days

153
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
they can see that everything's there and

154
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,919
probably at some point they stop looking

155
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,440
because they say okay everything's here

156
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,120
we can just check it whenever we want to

157
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
and if you probably have some

158
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
information out there that's easily

159
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,639
accessible but ones that you're

160
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,400
fine with having out there you can feel

161
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,919
a bit more secure

162
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,600
because if somebody would really try to

163
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,960
find the truth they're going to

164
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,160
have a very very hard time doing it this

165
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,840
also applies of course to

166
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,600
automated searches and things like that

167
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
again if you look up my name

168
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
lots of different addresses lots of

169
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
different birthdays as well it's

170
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,320
amazing to me how many people just put

171
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,919
their birthday out there

172
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,680
that's one of the key informations to

173
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,520
tie back to you for social engineering

174
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,120
attacks so

175
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
one quick tip have numerous different

176
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
birthdays out there what i like to do i

177
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,919
take my

178
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,600
favorite musician's birthdays and just

179
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,840
put it up there and change the year

180
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,880
it works quite well and so yeah

181
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,479
decentralization is also a scale

182
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,199
i do not have thousands of hundreds of

183
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,000
residencies

184
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
i do not have more than one passport but

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,199
i still consider myself very

186
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,400
decentralized

187
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,160
um a lot of people were talking about

188
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,840
you know do you feel super at home in

189
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,199
switzerland it's like well yes but i

190
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,720
also travel around a lot

191
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,520
and i think that there's a big

192
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,199
misconception also with people says that

193
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,080
you must have

194
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
these different passports these

195
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,800
different residencies these different

196
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
businesses five businesses around the

197
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,639
world

198
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,240
that's not true do it at your own pace

199
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,759
and do it what you're comfortable with

200
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,199
and find out exactly what you need and

201
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,840
that's what this workshop's gonna be

202
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,080
about

203
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,919
so one way as i mentioned is

204
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,840
citizenships and passports i'm not going

205
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,720
to talk about this

206
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,759
at all because the minimum price for

207
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,120
this is around 125 000 us dollars

208
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
and honestly if you had that kind of

209
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,560
money to just spend you probably are

210
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,880
better off hiring a specialist

211
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,479
to deal with your personal situation so

212
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,840
i'm not going to talk too much about

213
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,720
that but that is

214
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,919
an option of course nexus residencies i

215
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680
will be talking a little bit about that

216
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,919
pavel was actually one of the key

217
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,440
information providers

218
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,400
other one is business registration

219
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,280
connections

220
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,360
and lastly knowledge and understanding

221
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,680
for knowledge and understanding it's not

222
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,800
i would say it's not

223
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
really the starting step but it's

224
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,840
something that you need to do

225
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,440
it's amazing to me to meet people and

226
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
say oh i want to create a company in

227
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
seychelles

228
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
without understanding anything about

229
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
what seychelles is

230
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
where it even is on the map all they

231
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,759
know it costs a couple hundred

232
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,919
under a thousand us dollars to set up

233
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,039
and have

234
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,039
zero understanding let me bring up a

235
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,479
case where

236
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,960
this kind of really played out in real

237
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,400
life

238
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
so maybe you want to think yeah where

239
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,319
should i decentralize myself

240
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,039
this is hong kong this is something that

241
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
i'm sure everyone here and people

242
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,080
watching

243
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,280
where's the camera up there know about

244
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,080
what's going on

245
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,639
i'm not i wasn't surprised at all and

246
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,520
anyone who

247
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,879
properly understood hong kong history

248
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,360
would have understood that this was not

249
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
an if

250
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,240
this was a when in 1842 in the treaty of

251
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,960
nanking

252
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,800
hong kong island was ceded to the united

253
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,080
kingdom uh in perpetuity

254
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,039
in 1960 the kowloon peninsula and the

255
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,240
stone cutters island

256
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,599
was also seated in perpetuity

257
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,240
so why did the uk have to hand over hong

258
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,200
kong

259
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
a lot of people talk about the 99-year

260
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,320
lease

261
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,519
none of those were 99-year leases

262
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,839
and it's quite complex i'm not going to

263
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,839
go over everything

264
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,200
but basically

265
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,360
the uk tried to negotiate thatcher tried

266
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,120
to talk to the chinese government

267
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
the chinese government said well you

268
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,440
know we could just invade

269
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,560
and there's nothing really much you

270
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,959
could do about it of course there's a

271
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,760
lot of other

272
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,279
aspects around there where they talked

273
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,720
even until the end where they had an

274
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,519
argument about

275
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
how the flag raising and flag dropping

276
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,560
were to come

277
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,000
forward but this answer is simple

278
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
i had no choice

279
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,080
and if you think about that deeply that

280
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,120
in

281
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,959
the 80s that a country was just

282
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,760
willing to give out something to another

283
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,120
country that was saying that

284
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,640
hey we're just going to invade you if

285
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,519
you don't give it to us

286
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,399
this is not that surprising anymore and

287
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,000
yet many businesses said like okay yeah

288
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
i know hong kong's a great place and it

289
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,519
was

290
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,600
but all of the really good business

291
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,760
people i know in hong kong or set up a

292
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,080
business there always had an exit plan

293
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
unfortunately not everyone again it was

294
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
those people who did not understand

295
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,399
and did not spend their time researching

296
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,920
and understanding how the country

297
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,760
actually operates

298
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,839
that well they're entering into some

299
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,720
severe issues right now

300
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,360
so what to learn quite basic basic

301
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,279
history

302
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,800
international relations this is

303
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
something that

304
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,839
goes just beyond friendships and

305
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,519
treaties and stuff like that you have to

306
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,600
think about

307
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,519
when you have your data in such a

308
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,440
country what are they going to do with

309
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,000
it

310
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,839
a lot of people have told me oh i don't

311
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,440
care if russia has my data i don't care

312
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,160
if

313
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,000
china has my data which is fine it's

314
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,920
fine if that's in your comfort zone

315
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,279
that's okay

316
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,279
but you ever can consider the

317
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,120
possibility of them selling the data to

318
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,160
the people that you don't like

319
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,079
if you have great but most people

320
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,479
haven't

321
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
if there's something that your enemy

322
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,399
wants and your friend has it

323
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,160
don't always trust that your friend

324
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,680
isn't going to sell it to your enemy

325
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,120
of course depending how close you are to

326
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
them economy how self-sustaining it is

327
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,000
whether for example if you're

328
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,839
considering that as a getaway place as

329
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,560
well

330
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,200
um how self-reliant is it on its own

331
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,440
and the different cultures of course

332
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
it's very

333
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,720
important to to understand this also in

334
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,800
the terms of like you know would having

335
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,399
an online conversation

336
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,800
work as well as in person i think here

337
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,320
in europe that's mostly okay to just

338
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,839
have a zoom call or skype call or

339
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,959
whatever

340
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
um but when i'm from in the philippines

341
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,320
in south america

342
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
a lot of these things don't go very well

343
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
um

344
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,120
some countries you really need to even

345
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,560
have a meal with a person in order for

346
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,200
the deal to be finalized

347
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,839
and lastly politics i think that's very

348
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,800
self-explanatory

349
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,720
so where to learn well there's a lot of

350
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
really resources out there the two ones

351
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,440
that i can recommend

352
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,959
are geography now and history matters

353
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,720
geography now they have videos ranging

354
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,040
from 10 minutes to 25

355
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
obviously the larger countries get a

356
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,959
larger amount history matters

357
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,040
used to be 10 history in 10 minutes or

358
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,160
something like that and so a lot of

359
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,399
their videos are 10 minutes or less

360
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,920
uh highly recommend them actually a lot

361
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,279
of the information about the hong kong

362
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,120
one i got from a four minute video

363
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,920
from them a few months ago i'll have all

364
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,360
of my slides available as well by the

365
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,240
way

366
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,480
so travel also obviously is a very

367
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,839
beneficial thing actually going there

368
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,320
and understanding how things are

369
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
yes now it's not the best time but

370
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,079
perhaps hopefully sometime in the future

371
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,440
you'll be able to do that

372
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,519
because it's a great way to build

373
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,920
connections

374
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,880
so in all of these countries as paval

375
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,959
mentioned i've had multiple residencies

376
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,320
there's one country here i don't

377
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,000
actually have residency in and never

378
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,760
did fiji

379
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
i've only lived there for four months i

380
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
was there throughout my entire

381
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,720
you know permit to stay there without a

382
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,279
visa

383
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,880
so just a stamp on my passport which is

384
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
amazing as a philippine passport holder

385
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,480
to be able to stay somewhere with just a

386
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,880
stamp and

387
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,279
i consider that i i did reside there

388
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,720
because i know that i can go back there

389
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,600
anytime

390
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,519
and i'll have very close friends that i

391
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,279
can just go back to in the village

392
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,320
and stay with them if they need to if i

393
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,519
need to sorry

394
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,120
and that's one thing i want to point out

395
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,000
it's like

396
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
i don't have a residency there but still

397
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,279
i feel a very strong connection

398
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,560
the country has a very strong connection

399
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,399
to me i have a very good understanding

400
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
of how fiji works i lived there during

401
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,680
the dictatorship i

402
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,240
do not recommend that anybody do that i

403
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,600
don't that was one of the things that i

404
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
should have understood before actually

405
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,760
going there

406
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,760
um at least a little bit more but

407
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,200
yeah just frequently going to a place um

408
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,199
building good connections in an area can

409
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,920
make you very much connected there

410
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,279
because you can have a lot of working

411
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,839
relationships and this could lead to

412
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,440
also having multiple income streams

413
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,959
remember decentralizing yourself

414
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,959
also is not just in terms of residencies

415
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,639
and connections and all of this but also

416
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,160
where your money is coming from

417
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,839
if all of your money is coming from

418
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,360
let's say the one country that you don't

419
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,240
really like

420
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
to be associated with or it's the

421
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
country that you're from then you

422
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,079
might really not get as decentralized as

423
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:04,480
you

424
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,120
think you are

425
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
how to move forward with this especially

426
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,399
because you can travel too much

427
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,440
one is warm introductions this is an

428
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,880
offer that i will have for everybody

429
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,320
here in the workshop as well as everyone

430
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,360
watching online

431
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,440
if there's anybody within my network um

432
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,880
i have a large linkedin

433
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,639
contact list and i only add them if i've

434
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,079
actually spoken with them or have worked

435
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:26,560
with them

436
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,240
if you need any introduction to any of

437
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,079
those countries or people there please

438
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,680
let me know i'd be happy to make that

439
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,279
introduction for you

440
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,639
but yeah also reach out to your own

441
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,480
network and try to see if maybe there's

442
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,839
a country that you're interested in that

443
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,279
you've done some research and you're

444
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,199
interested in

445
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,399
actually speaking with somebody from

446
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,720
there and trying to

447
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,399
get along on a personal and professional

448
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,360
basis another one is using the

449
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,920
cross-border chambers of commerce i did

450
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,680
not think that this existed until this

451
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,279
year actually until i found out that

452
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,240
there's actually

453
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,680
even a swiss paraguayan chamber of

454
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,519
commerce in paraguay so it actually

455
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,440
helps a lot of people in switzerland

456
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,880
who are interested in doing business in

457
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,720
paraguay and also

458
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,480
just general trade between both

459
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,240
countries

460
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,920
i don't think there are that many around

461
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,279
but try to take a look

462
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,839
um if there's place from wherever you're

463
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,320
living

464
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,600
and wherever you want to go or have a

465
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,680
connection to these places are usually

466
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,279
quite helpful in terms of driving you

467
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,560
information

468
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,399
um and even if you want to try to do

469
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
some volunteering stuff with them

470
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,760
they're very much open to it and it's a

471
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,360
great way to get some work experience

472
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,120
and gain some contacts

473
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
last one is next one is cross-border

474
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,800
associations communities

475
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,279
this one is a little bit dependent on

476
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,480
whether there's a lot of people from

477
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,759
where you're from

478
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,480
in that country like for example in the

479
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,079
united states in the city of seattle

480
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,440
there's actually a swedish cultural

481
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,360
center which has then expanded to being

482
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,839
really a scandinavian cultural center so

483
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,199
if there's anyone from scandinavia here

484
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:51,600
is

485
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
interested there you could just look

486
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,800
that up and

487
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,759
yeah get try to get connected that way

488
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,639
travel again

489
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,959
not too possible right now and last

490
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,720
online communities i mean we're

491
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
right now this conference is partly

492
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,759
online and

493
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,320
reddit is actually a great way to get

494
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
the connections

495
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,320
and sometimes these actually come in

496
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,639
much

497
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,480
very handy even if you already have a

498
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,759
lot of personal connections so for

499
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
example

500
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
uh one of the flags you saw up there was

501
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
austria and

502
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,399
the second time i lived in austria i had

503
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,240
a lot of difficulties getting my

504
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
residence permit and actually being able

505
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,560
to go

506
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,519
um quick overview it takes five months

507
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,959
for them to process the residence permit

508
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,720
application after doing that i have to

509
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,079
apply for the visa

510
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,680
and then i fly in and then i have to

511
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,199
collect some papers to get the final

512
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:37,920
card

513
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,440
uh so all in all that's about seven

514
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,880
months just for me to get a residence

515
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,160
permit to be there for more than six

516
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,360
months

517
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
and it was taking too long there were

518
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,680
too many problems and i just started a

519
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,560
rant

520
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,440
on the austrian subreddit and a lawyer

521
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,880
reached out to me

522
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
and he just said i'll help you

523
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,399
for free i feel so bad for your

524
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,480
situation

525
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,720
i've never spoken with this guy he has

526
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,079
no idea who i am

527
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,119
i haven't been doing this back then and

528
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,559
he just did that he went to the

529
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,400
immigration office all the time and

530
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,799
um accompanied me also when i needed to

531
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,599
pick up the card

532
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,679
and he just asked me to donate 200 euros

533
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,959
to his charity

534
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,280
and so i did about 200 euros for all of

535
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,520
the help he made he just gave me it was

536
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,959
was tremendous i mean i'm not saying

537
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,400
that you know rely on such people

538
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,599
existing and helping you out all the

539
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,959
time but there's actually a significant

540
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,000
amount of people who

541
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,799
understand the pains of all of this and

542
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,000
are willing to lend a helping

543
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
hand and that's actually how i'm here

544
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,760
today i wouldn't have been

545
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
here uh without the help of many of my

546
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,919
friends and just random strangers who

547
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,200
might have no idea what their name is

548
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,799
and it's really i mean it's up to you

549
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,640
how you want to leverage this

550
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,520
um a lot of people might feel a bit

551
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
uncomfortable they don't want it to go

552
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,400
too much beyond friendship

553
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,720
they want to just keep it that way

554
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,840
that's fine

555
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,320
having friends is a great thing

556
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
sometimes again you might consider a

557
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,440
place a runaway place

558
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,799
so for me some places in the pacific

559
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,640
islands are um

560
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,160
in some places you don't want to you

561
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,919
know have a runaway place but more just

562
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,280
like i'm interested in doing business

563
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,559
here and maybe setting up a business

564
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,440
here in the future

565
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,799
something like that and that's really up

566
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
to what you feel like what you want and

567
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,160
your own personal situations

568
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
which then leads me to business

569
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,640
registration

570
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,000
there's a big misconception that you

571
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,640
must have a product to sell or

572
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
you need to have a team and that's

573
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,440
really not required i mean in my own

574
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,320
company

575
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,760
right now in my consulting company i'm

576
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
the only person

577
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,440
and it's been quite helpful just having

578
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,120
a corporate entity i mean now i live in

579
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,559
the country where my corporate entity is

580
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,039
set up

581
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,240
but it was very helpful when i was a

582
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,600
resident of the czech republic and when

583
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,200
i was still living in svalbard

584
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,320
having an entity in switzerland and not

585
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,440
just because it was in switzerland but

586
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,200
just having one that wasn't there

587
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,880
and one reason is because you can route

588
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,400
your employment through your business

589
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,280
entity

590
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
and so if you're concerned about certain

591
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,840
things like um

592
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,000
over taxation or just things like you

593
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
know maybe something that you don't want

594
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,840
to associate yourself with

595
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,640
um my consulting company i've used that

596
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,600
to consult for

597
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
maybe some projects that i didn't have i

598
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,039
didn't want to be associated too

599
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,240
strongly because i didn't believe in

600
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,679
their products so much

601
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,720
but of course i was willing to take

602
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,400
their money in terms of playing devil's

603
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,360
advocate

604
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,240
and for me when i was reporting it uh

605
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,760
then as a self-employed person

606
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
all they could see is invoicing my own

607
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,080
company and it worked quite well

608
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,400
um there's also beneficial i mean not

609
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,840
maybe not here in the czech republic but

610
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,600
if you're living in a country

611
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
that does not treat cryptocurrency

612
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
payments very well and you want to

613
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,160
report it for whatever reason maybe

614
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
immigration or otherwise

615
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
having it through a company that does

616
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,760
the conversion for you

617
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,440
is a great way to just get money in and

618
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
have a very simple tax reporting at the

619
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,880
end of the year for you personally

620
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,720
so out of 32 countries that i've looked

621
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,200
up

622
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,280
uh and tried to gather a lot of data on

623
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,720
these are the eight that i'm gonna go

624
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,039
over

625
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,480
just a little bit um

626
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,640
i should point out that one ibc has been

627
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,720
kind enough to spend a lot of hours with

628
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,600
me

629
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,960
just trying to go back and forth and

630
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
answering all of my questions so i have

631
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
some affiliation with them

632
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
affinity group gave me all the

633
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,840
information about the isle of man also

634
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,480
the

635
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,000
my logos the logo was missing there but

636
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
the digital isle of man they've been

637
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,320
very helpful in

638
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,520
making sure the information has been

639
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,360
correct um

640
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,280
i have a good contact also at one ibc

641
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,880
and affinity and they have both

642
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
expressed to me that if anybody here has

643
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,360
any questions

644
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
also online i'm i can make the

645
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,960
introduction and it's

646
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,559
no selling at all is just to share

647
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,960
information about these countries

648
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,520
i also have the full fact sheets of each

649
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,080
of these

650
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,159
and i'm happy to send that over i'm not

651
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,360
having them on the presentation because

652
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,520
there's too much information

653
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,360
so the first one i'll go over is bahamas

654
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,799
let me just quickly run through this

655
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,200
information here so the total cost

656
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,760
includes the filing expenses and the

657
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,039
legal expenses

658
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,440
renewal costs include any of the

659
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
recurring expenses needed perhaps office

660
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,840
registration and things like that

661
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,360
local directors some company some

662
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,720
countries require that somebody is

663
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
actually there presently

664
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,320
physically sorry and that can just be a

665
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,679
proxy director but obviously that's an

666
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,880
additional cost

667
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,080
um if you have a friend there then

668
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
that's great annual return so that's for

669
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,080
the tax reporting

670
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,240
accounts preparation it was a bit

671
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,679
strange for me when i first found this

672
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,880
out a couple of years ago

673
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,480
there are some countries that require

674
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
you to prepare the accounts

675
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,520
but you don't actually have to send it

676
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,960
i was told that the reason for this is

677
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
that if ever there is a

678
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,360
government mandated audit then you must

679
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,799
have it ready

680
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,080
but you actually don't need to be

681
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,960
proactive in sharing the information

682
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,640
how exactly you keep it it varies from

683
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,080
country to country

684
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,679
public shareholder records i'm happy to

685
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,039
say all of these are pretty much on the

686
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,360
no

687
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,039
side i wouldn't have included it here uh

688
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,120
if it was not um

689
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,280
so yeah that's bahamas it's uh very big

690
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,120
on tourism it's in the caribbean

691
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
johnny depp lives there so it's actually

692
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,120
has a pirate of the caribbean

693
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,720
next is mauritius this one's a little

694
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,159
bit more expensive

695
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,480
it's a very big place for fintech it's a

696
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,919
very multi-ethnic

697
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,440
community so if it's actually a country

698
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,280
that you're interested in moving into

699
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,400
um this could be something that

700
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
you could consider there's a lot of

701
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,360
people who have europe from european

702
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,799
descent a lot of asian descent and

703
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,720
african descent from here as well

704
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,480
and it's the only place in the world

705
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,760
where the dodo bird

706
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,360
was the native animal um

707
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,200
and should point out that here yes the

708
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
animal tax return you actually do have

709
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,679
to

710
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,080
um provide it for all of these come for

711
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,919
all these countries all foreign sourced

712
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,720
income

713
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,760
has zero percent taxation

714
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,480
for most of them also with capital gains

715
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,600
so the nevis

716
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,760
uh a lot of people like to think of

717
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,440
saint kitts and nevis as one country but

718
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,280
it's actually a federation

719
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
saint kitchen is also a good place to

720
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,559
have it but i decided to pick nevis

721
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,080
because the costs were significantly

722
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,520
lower as you can see there's just 1

723
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,799
500 and 1 400 for monthly uh

724
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,520
yearly sorry renewals oh by the way

725
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:01,840
quick

726
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
disclaimer on the costs um please do als

727
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,200
if you are going to

728
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,400
move forward with the business creation

729
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,919
please do take a look also at the

730
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,000
competitors of one ibc i'm not here to

731
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,679
to sell them this is just i'm using this

732
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,360
just as a benchmark so you might see

733
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
some other companies that charge higher

734
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,559
and some that charge lower

735
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,480
and of course you can find out ways to

736
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,400
to make it cheaper as well

737
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,440
and so yeah here it's pretty much the

738
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,600
same it's very fast just three days

739
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,880
um if you like mangoes they have 50

740
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
different varieties of mangoes

741
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,640
but none of them as good as the mango

742
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,840
from my hometown of cebu

743
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,360
the cayman islands of course that's a

744
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,120
very common choice

745
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,720
um but as you can see it's very

746
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,159
expensive just because of the

747
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,240
sheer demand of companies that are

748
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,120
people who are looking to set up

749
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
companies there

750
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,240
also is still fairly fast and annual

751
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,799
return

752
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,200
um is a yes also interestingly yeah the

753
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
cost difference

754
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,679
is not so much different i've seen some

755
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,360
companies actually ask for six thousand

756
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,279
dollars for this as well but

757
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,120
uh those seem to be for more specialist

758
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,400
stuff um

759
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,760
yeah that's another thing i should point

760
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,919
out if you're doing something

761
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,600
uh that might require additional

762
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,039
licenses these costs

763
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,720
um probably throw them out the window if

764
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,159
you need more licenses

765
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,760
i'm just using this for more standard

766
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,919
cases

767
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,000
panama is another one that's uh quite

768
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,960
interesting i'll be talking

769
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,799
a little bit more about this um for the

770
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,400
residency part but

771
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,960
these are the costs uh through one ipc

772
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,440
again

773
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,840
mostly nose which is great seychelles

774
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,080
what is it there so one of the most

775
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,360
popular ones

776
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,840
and interestingly um there's a current

777
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,640
case

778
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
um with this company called bitmex so if

779
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
you're in cryptocurrency trading please

780
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,919
you probably know what that is but if

781
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,760
you're not it's an exchange

782
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,000
that allows you to go up to 100x in

783
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,360
leverage

784
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,960
so almost like a casino really and

785
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
i recommend that you follow that case if

786
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
you're interested in setting up a

787
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,679
company in seychelles because it sets up

788
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,960
a president in terms of how

789
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,120
people get sued if their socially

790
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,000
special law

791
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,400
company operates in a way that their

792
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,840
hometown country does not like

793
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,600
actually seychelles has a very positive

794
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,279
banking stance now i was very surprised

795
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,640
to see that this year

796
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
i was talking about a variety of banks

797
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,840
in switzerland

798
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,000
and around europe and i just asked them

799
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,159
their opinion on seychelles just out of

800
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,720
sheer curiosity and actually they all

801
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,080
said that yeah seychelles is not in the

802
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,000
blacklist anymore we're happy to onboard

803
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,440
seychelles companies

804
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,120
actually they considered maltese

805
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,880
companies a little bit more

806
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,799
on the blacklist rather than safely

807
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,799
these companies so

808
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,880
they've done a lot on that end and it's

809
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,480
still fairly cheap

810
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,039
i and most i mean everything is just on

811
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,640
a no here and

812
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,880
i i would actually give you some urgency

813
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,760
if uh if the bitmex case works out well

814
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,240
in

815
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,600
in their favor and the positive banking

816
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,720
stance continues to

817
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,919
go forward because i'm assuming the

818
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,480
demand for specialist company will go up

819
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,559
in the near future so these costs are

820
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,000
fairly low right now but

821
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,880
they might go up soon

822
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,159
bit max mex mex

823
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,960
no problem vanuatu is another one that's

824
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,520
very

825
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,080
very interesting um i actually had my

826
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,679
own business in vanuatu as well and

827
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,679
just as an experiment also i tried to

828
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,760
set up bank accounts for the company

829
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,200
uh tried to create cryptocurrency

830
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
exchange accounts i was able to do that

831
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,559
it took six months

832
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,600
uh but i was able to do it and

833
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,919
um sadly i had to close it because

834
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,520
actually vanuatu ended up in the red

835
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,159
zone

836
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,159
so i can't fully recommend it but i

837
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,760
still decided to put it up here because

838
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,799
it's still

839
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,880
very favorable i should just let you

840
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,400
know that it's under scrutiny at the

841
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,039
moment

842
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,400
and a lot of countries tend to be very

843
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,080
hesitant when they see an invoice to a

844
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,960
vanuatu company

845
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,159
that said if you are planning to have

846
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,200
some presence of yourself with your data

847
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,960
in the pacific islands

848
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,480
it's very hard to set up a company there

849
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,559
i would actually recommend for now

850
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,760
against having one in fiji because the

851
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,440
political instability there is just too

852
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,880
great there's been three coups in the

853
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,279
last

854
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,279
uh 30 years um so it's not very secure

855
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,120
in terms of you know what could actually

856
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,240
be there

857
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,159
um so vanuatu has been fairly stable so

858
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,840
that's why i decided to to keep it up

859
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,760
here and in general if you have one

860
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,200
business in any of the pacific island

861
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,919
countries

862
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,440
it's easier to do business with other

863
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,399
pacific island nations

864
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,520
so the isle of man is probably the most

865
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,240
expensive

866
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,480
out of all of this and has more yeses

867
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,399
it's still on the no on the public

868
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,480
shareholder records

869
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,520
because of the local director

870
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,679
requirement the costs are much higher

871
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,159
but i decided to put it on here because

872
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,600
the blockchain isle of man and the

873
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,760
digital isle of man program

874
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
hosted by their government is actually

875
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
having relocation programs

876
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,279
where they're willing to give a certain

877
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,720
amount of money to help you move there

878
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,640
if you are interested in moving there

879
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,320
that's as long as you provide some sort

880
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
of like innovative service or have an

881
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,440
innovative product

882
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,880
so even if you're a consultant actually

883
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,559
you don't need to have

884
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,320
made something if you can just show that

885
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,600
yeah i've consulted a lot of different

886
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
projects that's even good enough for

887
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,240
them to consider you

888
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,120
on a specialist visa of course it's

889
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,799
still on a case-by-case basis

890
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,480
there's also a lot of grants that's

891
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,080
there and

892
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,159
even though if maybe they're not uh on

893
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,919
the swiss level in terms of secrecy

894
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,200
which really switzerland's not

895
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,720
too big on banking secrecy anymore

896
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,559
that's a old-time thing

897
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,880
it's uh they still treat uh

898
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,080
confidentiality

899
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,760
very strongly and they're actually also

900
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,080
actively trying to expand beyond just

901
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,880
eye gaming

902
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,640
so they're very open to having you in

903
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,559
the conversation and one nice thing also

904
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,679
it's a very small

905
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,679
country they are connected to united

906
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,799
kingdom of course

907
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,919
but they will actually try to consult

908
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:46,960
with you if they feel that you're an

909
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
expert on a certain topic so you have a

910
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,399
way to even influence their government a

911
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,679
little bit

912
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,200
which can be very beneficial not just

913
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,960
for you but if you care for certain

914
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,480
causes and things like that

915
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,840
could really help out a lot and that's

916
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,600
actually one reasons why i uh

917
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,000
keep uh in close contact with them

918
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,559
so where are these countries singapore i

919
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,240
didn't include because

920
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,840
uh the costs are very high to set up a

921
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,679
company there the tax

922
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,880
is low but actually it increases

923
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,360
every year until the third year so a lot

924
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,640
of companies out there will try to say

925
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
like oh look at this tax rate

926
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,440
in singapore but actually like if you

927
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,480
look at the next year it goes up and

928
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
then the year after goes up and then

929
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,279
you're paying standard tax rates

930
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,120
probably still lower than many places in

931
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,720
europe but not as low as

932
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
many people think when they get into it

933
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,679
and they've already sunk so much money

934
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,039
in they just keep it there

935
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,520
not all the time but sometimes cyprus i

936
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,039
removed because

937
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,679
last year they had now the tax of 12.5

938
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,080
um they are in the eu so a lot of the

939
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,960
data

940
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,880
can be transferred quite easily

941
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,080
switzerland um

942
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,799
for holding company tax benefits that

943
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,520
was

944
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,880
last year was the last year that their

945
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
tax benefits would have existed so

946
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,520
actually the

947
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
the benefits are not too great anymore

948
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
by having a holding company there

949
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
um me as a swiss resident actually makes

950
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,399
zero sense to have a swiss holding

951
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,600
company even

952
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,120
so there's so many holding companies

953
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
being shut down and just dividends being

954
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,159
distributed

955
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,880
um usa delaware and wyoming are two big

956
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,159
countries that a lot of people talk

957
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:12,559
about

958
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,039
i'm not including them because of yeah

959
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,240
privacy

960
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,520
violations numerous uh yeah

961
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,600
even if taxes are lower um i'm not

962
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,120
saying these countries are bad

963
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,880
um definitely if in your own personal

964
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,240
situations like if you want to move to

965
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,360
the u.s

966
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,960
maybe those two states are great to have

967
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,200
the company switzerland i mean i live

968
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,880
there

969
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,480
for a multitude of different reasons and

970
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,000
it's still possible to set up a business

971
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,520
there and still be able to operate in a

972
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,039
very internationally renowned way it's

973
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,840
just

974
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,679
didn't feel that it was the main thing

975
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,679
for this talk right now

976
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,320
so important notes um if wherever

977
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,000
possible use cryptocurrencies for

978
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,480
easier asset transfer setting up a bank

979
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,760
account for each of these

980
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,880
um company countries it's not the

981
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,760
easiest in vanuatu it costs about 25 000

982
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,519
even if you don't do anything that's

983
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,360
crazy

984
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
seychelles is also somewhere between 10

985
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,640
and 20 000

986
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,240
uh depending on your relationship with

987
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,080
the bank and in all of the other places

988
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,120
because you're not going to be there

989
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,000
physically

990
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,679
um it might be expensive to have to hire

991
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,519
a lawyer to sign on your behalf all the

992
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,440
time one ibc also provides that service

993
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,960
but even they say like yeah it's

994
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,440
quite expensive and so they warn people

995
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,320
in advance about it

996
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,919
one other one thing though is that local

997
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,480
banking is not always required

998
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,840
it can be a little bit difficult

999
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,399
sometimes

1000
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,559
but like with this company so it's euro

1001
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,240
pacific bank i should point out that i

1002
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,760
do have a relationship with this bank i

1003
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,200
am a referring agent

1004
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,640
and so if you are interested i can

1005
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,320
actually do the initial onboarding for

1006
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,880
you

1007
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,559
um but yeah as you can see the cost

1008
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,399
structure here is very low

1009
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,159
it's a private bank but without private

1010
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,000
banking costs other than the transfers

1011
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,200
so incoming is

1012
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,120
receiving and outgoing sending out it is

1013
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,240
quite high

1014
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,880
so i wouldn't use this if you are doing

1015
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,399
many different transactions

1016
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,399
with your company but if you do need a

1017
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,919
bank um this one

1018
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,720
is uh is quite good but if you are using

1019
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,480
cryptocurrencies you cannot use this

1020
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,120
bank

1021
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,399
i have tried to talk to them to become

1022
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,679
more crypto friendly and they've

1023
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,480
actually

1024
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,399
been fairly positive about

1025
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,919
cryptocurrencies or at least neutral

1026
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:14,559
about it

1027
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,840
but they have mentioned to me that a lot

1028
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,919
of their

1029
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,799
intermediary banks uh have not approved

1030
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,320
certain transactions from exchanges and

1031
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,679
things like that even if you have all of

1032
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,039
your papers

1033
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,480
so it's one or the other

1034
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,720
try to pay a little tax if you can um

1035
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
i know that with zero tax is great

1036
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,679
because you don't have to pay almost

1037
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,120
anything but

1038
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
just from my experience with setting up

1039
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,799
companies with zero tax and then trying

1040
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,399
to get them onto like exchanges and

1041
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,519
things like that

1042
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,600
one of the requirements is to submit

1043
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,360
perhaps you know some documents regards

1044
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,880
to tax returns and if you say i don't

1045
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,080
have anything

1046
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,440
um well they'll ask you to justify it

1047
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,840
and then it goes to this whole

1048
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,159
subjective um

1049
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,320
valid verification and you know

1050
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,159
sometimes it can go well if they're very

1051
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,600
if they're very knowledgeable about the

1052
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,840
country then it'll go very smoothly

1053
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,679
but if already they're very suspicious

1054
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,360
about you it's going to be the burden of

1055
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,799
proof is going to be on your side

1056
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,039
so just keep that in mind and i mean

1057
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,480
even if you can just pay like some

1058
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,320
government fees here and there to apply

1059
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,880
for this

1060
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,679
license that you might not even use ever

1061
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,120
that's still very useful

1062
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,480
because then you can show that yeah i'm

1063
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,679
trying to do everything and being

1064
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,960
compliant

1065
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,799
basically try to check the boxes

1066
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,880
that may not be necessarily like solid

1067
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,240
boxes but ones that they will be

1068
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,600
considered like the good to haves

1069
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,159
also yeah lastly check with how you're

1070
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,519
taxed where you live

1071
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,519
uh this might actually cause more

1072
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,720
problems for you

1073
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,919
than good i know in spain this does not

1074
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,240
solve your issue at all in terms of tax

1075
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,120
reduction

1076
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,840
um or might even increase it in some

1077
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,559
cases so

1078
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,240
please do that research on your own

1079
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,080
lastly with the residency i only have a

1080
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,840
few minutes i'm gonna have to try to

1081
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,760
push through this one quickly residency

1082
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,279
is not equal to passport

1083
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,640
you don't get a passport when you have

1084
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
it but sometimes

1085
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,399
yeah you still get the right of entry so

1086
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,760
it was very interesting when i had track

1087
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
residency and swiss residency

1088
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,280
during the time of the lockdowns i was

1089
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,560
one of the few people in the world who

1090
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,159
would be allowed to fly back and forth

1091
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,760
or at least drive back and forth

1092
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,800
because i could always say i'm just

1093
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,879
going home and they would have to let me

1094
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,159
through because i had the right

1095
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,879
of passage local status so then you're

1096
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,159
able to get certain discounts that only

1097
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,679
local people can get

1098
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,119
they can if you want to avail them some

1099
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,440
government services you can do that

1100
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,760
um some price like phone numbers and

1101
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,040
things like that sometimes they require

1102
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,399
that you actually be a resident

1103
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,560
of the country um which can be very

1104
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,000
useful if you want to put that phone

1105
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,040
number inside of your

1106
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,359
one here uh whenever you're doing phone

1107
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,359
verification

1108
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,679
tax residency of course one thing that

1109
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,639
you can also get

1110
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,000
just by having a residency somewhere

1111
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,879
else some international benefits

1112
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,440
so for example um with panama which i'll

1113
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,800
be going over later

1114
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
sorry paraguay if you're a resident of

1115
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,480
paraguay you get access to all of the

1116
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,240
mercury countries although i think

1117
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
for people who don't have a passport as

1118
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,280
shitty as mine

1119
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,359
um you probably can go their visa-free

1120
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,640
anime but for people like me

1121
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,119
it's great if i have the paraguayan

1122
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,720
residency because then i can go to

1123
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,079
all of the mercosur countries without

1124
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,160
having to apply for a visa so it could

1125
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,520
even save you money depending on what

1126
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,440
you want to do

1127
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,280
so unfortunately there's only two

1128
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
countries that i have on here and it's

1129
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,200
because

1130
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,760
a lot of this process has been changing

1131
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,359
a lot in the past year

1132
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,160
and also a lot of things are not very

1133
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,520
clear online in terms of their

1134
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,040
requirements and things like that

1135
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,599
paraguay had an asterisk because until

1136
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,880
today

1137
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,240
i didn't meet anyone who went through

1138
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,520
the process and actually got the card

1139
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,359
but pavel just informed me that he has

1140
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,040
it now

1141
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,960
so he can probably verify certain stuff

1142
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,119
here um so liberation travel is the one

1143
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,160
that provided me a lot of this

1144
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,440
information so i'm not able to go

1145
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,040
through the entire steps for each of

1146
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,160
those two countries because it's just

1147
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,760
too long but if you want more

1148
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,800
information happy to make the

1149
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,839
introductions and

1150
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,200
again they're happy to talk to you about

1151
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,960
it

1152
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,920
make sure you have your birth

1153
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
certificate passport proof of current

1154
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,480
residency diplomas if you have any

1155
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
national police clearance i have all of

1156
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,200
this in one folder

1157
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
i have multiple birth certificates

1158
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,119
because i've had that lost

1159
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,960
not by myself not by the postal service

1160
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,000
but by the freaking embassies

1161
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,079
they can lose documents so have copies

1162
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,040
wherever possible

1163
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,839
and check if your country or the

1164
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,200
countries that have issued those

1165
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,400
documents are part of the hague

1166
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,680
convention

1167
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,280
because if they are not in the hay

1168
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,680
convention that document will need to go

1169
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,240
through

1170
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,720
the relative the respective department

1171
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,680
of foreign affairs

1172
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,280
and then to the embassy of the country

1173
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,040
that you're sending it to

1174
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,800
which can take quite a lot of time so

1175
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,320
for example for my police currents

1176
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,520
in the philippines when i tried to move

1177
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,359
to the czech republic um

1178
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,599
somebody had to get it from in in manila

1179
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,119
um take it to department of foreign

1180
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,800
affairs have that notarized

1181
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,200
and then the track embassy had to then

1182
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,800
authenticate it which took a process

1183
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,240
about

1184
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,920
two and a half months and about 750

1185
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,160
euros which was painful

1186
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,960
so try to not have it oh it's not as

1187
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,880
clear as i would have liked

1188
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,640
yeah so this is the information for for

1189
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,480
paraguay the total cost is around one

1190
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,839
thousand seven hundred dollars that

1191
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,920
includes all the translation as well

1192
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,160
um notable is that you don't actually

1193
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,599
need to

1194
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,400
uh have been in paraguay before so you

1195
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,000
can start the application now and the

1196
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,440
only time that you'll have to go is when

1197
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,960
you need your photo taken

1198
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,040
uh for the card it takes about three to

1199
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,000
six months

1200
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,240
um right now the estimates are kind of

1201
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,599
all over the place and also depends of

1202
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,880
course on how fast you can get your

1203
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,000
documents

1204
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,520
uh physical presence is only actually

1205
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
one day every three years

1206
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,280
um again as i mentioned access to

1207
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,040
mercury countries yeah sorry it's not

1208
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,720
that clear but again my slides would be

1209
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,359
available to everyone and financial

1210
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,880
requirements as you can see up there

1211
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,359
it's deposit of about 4 500 united

1212
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,480
states dollars

1213
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
it's actually in the paraguayan currency

1214
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,560
so it fluctuates a little bit

1215
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,000
or you can do the same and create a

1216
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,079
company there also you could have a

1217
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,960
diploma i think that might be used as a

1218
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,960
substitute for that

1219
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,800
sorry the land oh

1220
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,040
i haven't looked that up properly sorry

1221
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,960
um

1222
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,240
i think it varies also quite a lot

1223
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,720
paraguayan uh history is very

1224
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,440
interesting

1225
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,200
it's one of the only countries in the

1226
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,720
world i think the only country in the

1227
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,520
world to have

1228
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,440
outlawed same race marriages

1229
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,680
which is very strange so a lot of their

1230
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,079
sorry you are not allowed to marry the

1231
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,359
same race

1232
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,079
for a while it's illegal now but at some

1233
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,440
time in the past it wasn't so

1234
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,680
uh it's yeah paraguay and history and

1235
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,040
demographics and stuff like that's very

1236
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,079
interesting so

1237
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,320
it's it's also hard for me to get

1238
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,200
information because i don't speak

1239
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,480
spanish

1240
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,760
um panama

1241
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,680
it's about the same but it is more

1242
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,280
expensive so as you can see it's like

1243
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,960
gotten a lot more difficult and a lot

1244
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,040
more expensive even the isle of man

1245
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,119
a company set up will be a lot cheaper

1246
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,359
and so legal application fees go up to

1247
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,200
around 5000 but that's also accounting

1248
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,640
for the flights and hotels and all this

1249
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,000
stuff because you need to go there about

1250
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,079
three times before you can actually get

1251
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,280
the residency

1252
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,480
um again in terms of physical presence

1253
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,160
requirements is very low it's only one

1254
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,800
day

1255
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,119
for every two years uh liberation travel

1256
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,680
has a full document on this that uh

1257
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,440
i can check with pavel if i can share

1258
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,520
that with all of you uh but it goes over

1259
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,200
this a lot more sorry i need to hurry up

1260
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,839
somewhere

1261
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,920
out of time deposit is six thousand

1262
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,160
dollars

1263
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,359
so actual residency approach remember to

1264
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,640
deedge register from the place that

1265
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,520
you're actually

1266
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,800
physically in if you don't want to be

1267
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,400
registered there anymore a lot of people

1268
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,760
forget this

1269
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,599
and end up still getting taxed in their

1270
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,119
own residency

1271
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,800
and having all of the data still there

1272
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,119
and not in the other country

1273
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,320
don't just rely on the card have a

1274
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,400
convincing story at some point you might

1275
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,520
be asked

1276
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,359
you might be asked just you know by

1277
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,440
somebody official and then

1278
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,359
you know in anything that's subjective

1279
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,480
it might go against you

1280
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,920
if you can't really talk a little bit

1281
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,160
more about the country

1282
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,000
not when you're there but when you're

1283
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,599
outside

1284
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,319
um have an entity where you actually

1285
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,400
reside have a business entity

1286
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,200
a lot of people try to just neglect that

1287
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,480
completely while living

1288
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,680
in the country that they're actually

1289
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
living in

1290
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,040
but if you're having a business there

1291
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,480
you can use that business then for all

1292
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
of your purchases

1293
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,400
renting your apartment buying property

1294
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,839
and things like that that way then it

1295
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,520
doesn't get connected to you personally

1296
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,560
but in that country but instead you in

1297
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,920
the other country

1298
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,720
so keep that in mind and yeah lastly

1299
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,040
check

1300
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,880
tax treaties and rules that's very

1301
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,640
important because again this might

1302
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,839
actually end up with you having to pay

1303
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,400
more taxes

1304
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,680
so actual residency approach so now it's

1305
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,119
about the actual

1306
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,000
actually being in the place aka being a

1307
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,960
digital nomad

1308
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,560
so as i mentioned in fiji i didn't

1309
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
actually have residency there

1310
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,440
uh instead i was just um just around

1311
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:57,920
there

1312
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,079
and uh again people asking like why

1313
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,520
would i choose to live there and why

1314
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,119
would i go here there

1315
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,240
or wherever it's just because of

1316
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,000
who i was at the time at the time i was

1317
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,440
really just looking for a little bit of

1318
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,960
an adventure and trying to go somewhere

1319
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
that i think i would never have gone

1320
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,560
back before

1321
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,720
i'm not because of that i'm not able to

1322
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,000
really have a step-by-step

1323
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
kind of thing with choosing which

1324
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,599
country to move to that's really up to

1325
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,960
you i'm happy to have the conversation

1326
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,160
with you one-on-one if you are

1327
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,359
interested

1328
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,640
i've known people from many different

1329
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,640
countries moving to many other different

1330
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,750
countries

1331
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,119
[Music]

1332
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,680
and yeah just have some self-reflection

1333
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,560
um

1334
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,160
if you if you choose to want to move

1335
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,240
understand it it's not easy

1336
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,480
um i didn't own any furniture for about

1337
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,000
five years

1338
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,599
and for some people that's you know

1339
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,599
that's that's not easy to think that you

1340
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,520
have two suitcases and a guitar and

1341
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,079
that's

1342
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,000
all of your possessions and if you lose

1343
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,359
one craft you lost half of everything

1344
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,119
and having to get rid of stuff is also a

1345
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,880
very painful process saying goodbye to

1346
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,079
friends if you're not going to see them

1347
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,920
again if you don't travel as much i'm

1348
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,599
lucky that i get to travel a lot

1349
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,760
so i don't usually have that issue so

1350
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,520
yeah last notes no ed capitalist is a

1351
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,400
good resource

1352
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,040
i'm sorry i have to go fast try to get a

1353
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,960
foreign bank account euro pack bank also

1354
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,240
has personal bank accounts it's a bit

1355
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,079
cheaper it's about half the price

1356
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,440
not for transactions but for setting up

1357
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,280
don't push further than what you need a

1358
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,880
lot of people really again try to go

1359
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,560
really far really fast and then they end

1360
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,119
up

1361
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,760
in more bills than they actually want

1362
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,680
take things one step at the time try not

1363
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,079
to rush

1364
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,119
things unless you want to throw in a lot

1365
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,040
more money to speed up the process

1366
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,680
and lastly be flexible a lot of the

1367
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,200
places i moved to were not because i

1368
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
chose to at the time but because i had

1369
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,760
to

1370
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,640
and it's that flexibility that really

1371
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,599
was able to make me

1372
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,520
calm like people ask me how the hell did

1373
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,880
you survive

1374
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,599
that endeavor just having to lose

1375
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,839
everything and starting all over well

1376
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,359
i learned to be flexible from a long

1377
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,440
time ago so

1378
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,119
the fight against digital totality for

1379
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,720
me is not just so much in terms of

1380
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,560
having all the encryption tools

1381
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
um but trying to approach it in a more

1382
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,359
cunning way

1383
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,520
it's something that a lot of places try

1384
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,119
not to attack so much

1385
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,000
again by having misinformation out there

1386
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,640
i'm not saying

1387
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,119
lie to the places but if there's

1388
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,560
information you don't care about put it

1389
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,200
up there

1390
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,640
there's information that you care about

1391
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,720
try to keep it down and they might think

1392
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,079
that you're already sharing too much

1393
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,280
information and just

1394
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
okay pass along which is what's happened

1395
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,440
for me many times

1396
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,599

let us know

1414
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,400
after the conference yeah cool and

1415
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,560
i think we have a couple of minutes for

1416
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,079
questions so

1417
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,119
ask yeah

1418
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,000
portugal uh yeah i was supposed to go

1419
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,079
over it a little bit but the person

1420
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:26,960
i wasn't able to get the right

1421
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,720
information and i also realized that

1422
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,160
most of the attendees are

1423
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
european so you guys can just literally

1424
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,359
go there

1425
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,160
without much of a problem uh and so like

1426
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,680
if i was going to talk about the process

1427
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,119
i didn't think it would be that relevant

1428
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,720
so i said skip it for now but

1429
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,000
if you'd like when i get the proper

1430
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,119
information i can send it to you

1431
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,200
oh okay the thing is that

1432
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,440
what i know for like some of my friends

1433
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,880
that uh they

1434
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,760
got uh residency in portugal portugal is

1435
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,119
probably not now one of the best

1436
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,640
european country

1437
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,359
if you are involved in crypto because

1438
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:01,839
you have

1439
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,160
no obligation to tax your crypto if you

1440
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,839
have political uh

1441
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,000
tax residency for portuguese portuguese

1442
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,359
tax presence i think it's for five to

1443
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,079
ten years

1444
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,359
yeah right now yeah i think it's

1445
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,880
temporary like everything in europe is

1446
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,160
temporary but yeah yeah

1447
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,760
but that one you actually have to like

1448
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,800
live there yeah exactly just be flexible

1449
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,520
yeah another questions okay wait a

1450
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,960
moment i'm going to

1451
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,000
bring you the microphone

1452
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,400
what do you think about the estonia

1453
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,440
e-resident

1454
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,280
thing i mean it doesn't really do

1455
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,440
anything a lot of people have

1456
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,800
brought that suggestion to me because

1457
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,960
you get residency but you don't

1458
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,400
all you can do with that card is signed

1459
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,160
documents legally digitally that's it

1460
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,880
which is great

1461
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,880
which is great i'm not saying it's bad

1462
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,000
but it doesn't do anything in terms

1463
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,839
of residency in terms for me i still

1464
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,520
need to set up a company there

1465
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,560
if i want an estonian visa

1466
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,720
8 000 euros not including legal expenses

1467
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,599
not including

1468
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,880
office and then um

1469
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,640
yeah okay like i'd be able to move there

1470
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,560
that way but the card didn't do anything

1471
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,160
other than allow me to sign the document

1472
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:06,560
so

1473
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,200
yes it's a cost cutter maybe but other

1474
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,400
than that doesn't do much

1475
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,760
and you can three bosses okay that's new

1476
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,560
oh okay

1477
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,119
did not know that yeah so so this is not

1478
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,880
a real residency no it's not it's just

1479
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,359
uh it means you you can just interact

1480
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:21,920
with their

1481
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,440
government services that's all yeah it's

1482
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,680
a it's

1483
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,839
a bit fraudulent in my opinion but yeah

1484
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
that's my opinion

1485
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,319
okay some other questions

1486
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,599
maybe last questions give you any

1487
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:36,480
question

1488
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,720
okay

1489
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,960
i just have a practical question because

1490
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,040
you mentioned the total cost

1491
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,520
but what is it actually that is in the

1492
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,720
total costs

1493
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,440
so for the total cost it covers all of

1494
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:51,920
the

1495
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,040
legal expenses i try to also include any

1496
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,560
translation expenses that might be

1497
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,359
needed

1498
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,440
of course a lot of these are estimates

1499
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,800
you can translate on your own if you can

1500
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,040
all of the government filing fees all of

1501
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,240
the

1502
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,440
you know fees all the way from the

1503
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,960
filing all the way to the processing and

1504
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,480
everything like that so i tried to

1505
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:10,960
include

1506
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,400
as much as possible in there so there

1507
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,000
were no hidden fees but

1508
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,079
i i haven't gone through the process for

1509
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,599
all of these countries so i can't really

1510
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:18,960
like attest to them

1511
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,720
but at least with the ones from one ibc

1512
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,559
they've been very upfront with me about

1513
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:23,680
it

1514
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,839
there are perhaps some additional costs

1515
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,839
if you do something unique

1516
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,000
um and those ones i didn't include

1517
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,440
because i wanted this just for the

1518
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,720
standard you know like

1519
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,559
as a consultant kind of company um

1520
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,160
yeah and the recurring costs that one

1521
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,839
also included like the first year office

1522
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,599
if an office was required

1523
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,280
and if a local director was required for

1524
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,119
that country i also included that fee

1525
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,000
there

1526
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,319
um for the for the office fee i tried to

1527
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,359
take the average

1528
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,920
instead of getting the lowest one

1529
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,480
because

1530
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,839
that way you'd be happy if you see

1531
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,839
something cheaper

1532
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,960
the recurring costs included accountant

1533
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,559
to do all of the accounting

1534
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,000
reporting whether or not it's sent

1535
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,839
the office registration and any other

1536
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,680
fees in order to keep it up

1537
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,280
also local director year leafy and

1538
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:21,839
things like that
