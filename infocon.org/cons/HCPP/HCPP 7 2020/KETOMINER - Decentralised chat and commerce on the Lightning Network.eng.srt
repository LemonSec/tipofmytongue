1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,040
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,240
um

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,400
first of all it's a real honor to be

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,400
here today uh four years ago i

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,799
was my first http i would never imagine

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,080
being on stage

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,839
and especially not in these particular

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,680
conditions

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,600
so yeah thank you for for being here and

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,960
thanks for cpp for

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,320
having me so um today i'll be talking

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,000
about decentralized

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,680
chat and commerce on the lightning

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,760
network

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,800
just a few words about me

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,840
i started programming at 7 and getting

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,399
paid for making electronics at 16

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,360
and never stopped since then you can

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,559
read that you can

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,239
screenshot that if you want to read it

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,600
later and

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,920
in the bitcoin space i created another

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
project which are hardware and hosted

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,039
full nodes

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,879
and the host for coins which is an

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,120
anonymous hosting

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,718
service vps service

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,440
and i'm trying to contribute to as many

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,480
projects as i

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,760
can first

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
disclaimer i'm paid by the sphinx chat

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,920
project for hosting a part of their

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,880
servers and for consulting for them

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,040
but these slides were not altered by the

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,600
creator of sphinx

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,840
there is only one sentence from him and

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,439
everything else is for me

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,000
there will be a first part technical

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,840
part a bit long and the

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,799
philosophical parts a bit shorter and

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
then

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,280
some closing statement a very personal

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
one

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,640
so um there's that guy paul

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,159
who started the sphinx project this is

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,040
an email he sent his wife in 2018

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
after seeing the creator of whatsapp

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
resigning from this job

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,320
and it says online routing

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,880
of a lightning network sphinx protocol

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,320
for private message

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,759
wallet app equals messenger and that's

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,479
pretty much the whole story about the

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,119
sphinx app

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,480
a few few months later i started

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,760
proposing

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,800
consulting services i actually

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,319
sold only one consultation and it was to

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,080
that guy

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
he booked his consultation one hour

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,239
after i posted the tweet

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,959
about starting this service and

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,760
i'm i shouldn't even have accepted his

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,200
money for this because i learned much

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,760
more than

66
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,360
he did for me um the guy

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,120
paul a very interesting person he

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,319
his intel into keto

69
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,080
the diet he made an app for

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,319
uh mostly americans it has not many

71
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
resources outside america but

72
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,959
so the senza app is his app about keto

73
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,959
diet you can get coached

74
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,720
and so on and he also had the business

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,040
of you probably know the amazon

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
mechanical turk service

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,800
uh basically you can through an api

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,760
submit jobs that will be executed by

79
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,280
human

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,440
people um for example solving captures

81
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,560
or analyzing pictures and these two

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
things are actually very closely

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,599
related because in sensor you can take a

84
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,080
picture

85
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
of the label of a food product you're

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,680
buying

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,159
and it's trying like to analyze the

88
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,680
composition

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,080
but sometimes the ocr doesn't work very

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,440
well so

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,080
the picture gets submitted to stack work

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,959
which is the

93
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,400
his mechanical turk paid in lightning

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,680
service and um

95
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
so you have some few actual humans that

96
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,799
will read the label

97
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
and process the data and

98
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,640
what is funny about stack work is that

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,879
basically most of the stack workers

100
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,560
they are called like this are in the

101
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,040
philippines so you have some

102
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,480
people like getting satoshis over

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
lightning

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
for making micro tasks in the

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,160
philippines

106
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
for a ridiculous amount of money for the

107
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
people who are submitting the tasks but

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,960
which are considered

109
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,639
considerable amount of money for the

110
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,560
people who are executing the tasks

111
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,280
so it's a very humane project uh

112
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,400
actually

113
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
and uh recently he started because you

114
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,639
need a phone to

115
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,759
execute the tasks so recently as part of

116
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,240
your

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
stack work you can get a free phone

118
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,000
and a free phone subscription so these

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
people just get a free phone free

120
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,720
subscription they do tasks and they can

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,520
cash out to a bitcoin wallet and

122
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,600
yeah and the main issue was he needed a

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
wallet so

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,440
he created swings chat also to be this

125
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,520
missing

126
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,758
piece

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,800
during this call he

128
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,320
i think you need to yeah

129
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
he showed me this demo

130
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
so this is running in the iphone

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,160
simulator on the mac

132
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,360
it's i mean it's just a chat app it's

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,840
nothing more but there are some

134
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,840
interesting additions in it

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,199
so inside the app you can send messages

136
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,320
which travel

137
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,240
over the lightning network it's not out

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,360
of band it's really

139
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,160
payments which are carrying the messages

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,039
and you can make

141
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,440
payment requests and payments so you can

142
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
just push a payment to someone using key

143
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
send i'll talk about it later

144
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,680
and you can send the regular lightning

145
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,400
invoice and

146
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
just pay the invoice inside the app you

147
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,240
can also of course pay regular

148
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
lighting invoices outside of this

149
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,440
ecosystem

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,160
so what's interesting is what is the the

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
tech behind this

152
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,720
um this is how lightning was

153
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,840
initially designed to work

154
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,319
person a sends an invoice to person b

155
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,160
person b pays the invoice

156
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,560
and the payment is done but

157
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,240
there is so-called sphinx scent mod

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,280
in enlightening it's actually

159
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,960
this name is not very much used and it's

160
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,560
not related to the app name

161
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,720
but yeah it's better known as key send

162
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,440
and with key send when key send is

163
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,479
enabled on the destination node

164
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,240
you can push a payment without an

165
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,400
invoice what's cool about this

166
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,639
is that you actually don't need this

167
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,319
feature to be enabled on the sending

168
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,160
side and you don't need it to be enabled

169
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
on the routing nodes as well

170
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
so you can do key sends between two

171
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
random nodes which are enabled

172
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
with key send and in the middle they

173
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,319
don't have to know anything about this

174
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
protocol because it's all in the tlv

175
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,360
onion of the

176
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,400
lightning message

177
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,199
and in january 2019 rose beef

178
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
made a patch for lnd which allows

179
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,720
kisens this patch was only merged

180
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,840
almost a year later in the mainstream

181
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,879
lng

182
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,440
so a few months later we met in san

183
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
francisco with paul

184
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,639
and we made what any reasonable tech

185
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,479
person does in san francisco we signed a

186
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,759
napkin contract

187
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,319
of course you can see the details here

188
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,599
and that's how we started working

189
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,000
together

190
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,000
in summer 2019 there was a very early

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,560
version

192
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,160
of this application the

193
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
relay which is the piece that does the

194
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,400
interface between the mobile app and the

195
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,800
lightning node was in python

196
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,520
so this is how the whole infrastructure

197
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,560
looked

198
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,360
so for sending they were just executing

199
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,240
ellen clee

200
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
with the kiss and argument and

201
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,760
there was a small issue because since

202
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,240
keysend is not really like mainstream in

203
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,599
lnd at this

204
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,399
point in time there was no way to know

205
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:40,880
that

206
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,080
the payment was received so the only way

207
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,399
to do that

208
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,519
was to enable debug level logs

209
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,959
and have the applicator relay read the

210
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,560
logs of lnd to detect the payments

211
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
and one thing also to know is that the

212
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,519
only information about the payment that

213
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,600
is in the logs is the amount

214
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
so that's how it works

215
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,279
most codes over lightning payment

216
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,680
amounts

217
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,160
fast forward to berlin in

218
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,399
fall 2019 at the lightning conference

219
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,000
the relay got remade in not gs

220
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
the sending still pretty much the same

221
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,680
but over the api

222
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,040
so a little bit published but receiving

223
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,760
steer reading logs and the encoding was

224
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,040
better instead of sending morse code we

225
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,839
were sending

226
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,279
ascii codes over lightning amounts

227
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,600
so 1000 sats plus ascii value

228
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
only seven bits so and the messages was

229
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
very were

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,560
capped to be very short because we were

231
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,920
sending the

232
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,480
message letter by letter so each payment

233
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,240
was one letter of the message

234
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
so you can imagine if you send the 30

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,920
characters

236
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,839
message lightning is not exactly instant

237
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,440
and it required the patched version of

238
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,279
lnd because keystone was still not

239
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,000
merged in

240
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
lnd at that time

241
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,360
so yeah we planned to enable 100 users

242
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,279
in berlin then 50 then 20

243
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,279
then 10 and one of the reason for that

244
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,640
is this routing nightmare uh

245
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,800
with lng there is a whole slide about

246
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
this later

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
when you have node a connected to node b

248
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
with a channel and b to c

249
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,399
node a at this point on time of time was

250
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,720
unable to find a route to not see even

251
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,839
if it's obvious for anyone looking

252
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,640
and this is what we finished by doing we

253
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
did a full mesh

254
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,839
of channels between all the 10 nodes

255
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
and it mostly works of course every time

256
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,360
we were doing a demo to any investor it

257
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,720
didn't but

258
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,000
at least when we were testing it

259
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,839
internally it works

260
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,760
lnd so this is the

261
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,959
issue you try to query it out or to send

262
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,200
the payment from a to c

263
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,640
it doesn't find a route that's until

264
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,240
lnd 0.10 was very common

265
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
now it's a little less so

266
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,640
but we still had to make

267
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,040
lnd a little more optimistic than it is

268
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,320
by default

269
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,399
thanks to some recent additions

270
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,720
lnd invalidates a channel if it fails a

271
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,760
payment

272
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,880
for some grace period

273
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
so what we did is penalty half life

274
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
five seconds instead of i don't know

275
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,519
four hours by default or something

276
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
turn off um failure verification

277
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,120
and set very high default probability

278
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,160
of success with this we

279
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,360
have like 99

280
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,220
of success on nodes we control

281
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,839
[Music]

282
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,720
um and

283
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,760
this is what i'll be talking now um we

284
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,000
are hosting a massive amount of

285
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,560
lighting notes for this project because

286
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,519
every app

287
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,639
has to have its own lightning node

288
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,760
one user equals one lnd and how do

289
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,040
how many do you think you can connect of

290
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,639
lnds to one bitcoin d

291
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,680
actually not that much because uh

292
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,920
zero mq was never designed to have more

293
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,610
than one client connected

294
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,880
[Music]

295
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
and even with tuning the configuration

296
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,639
it's very

297
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,720
very bad so

298
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,160
first way to solve that was to

299
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
initialize the nodes one by one when

300
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,760
they are synchronizing one by one

301
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
it mostly works but if you have to

302
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,160
reboot the server with 100 nodes on it

303
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,880
they win everything oops

304
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,320
um so the other way to use lnd is with

305
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,160
neutrino yeah neutrino is great but

306
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,120
there are like 10

307
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,959
uh public servers for nutrients on the

308
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,720
internet so

309
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,000
um so neutrino requires the

310
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
bitcoin server to run what is called

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,440
compact filters

312
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,760
you can run btcd which i personally

313
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,480
don't like

314
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,519
and you can run bitcoin not the log dash

315
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,320
gr

316
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,760
fork now it's merged into core

317
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,360
i don't know if it's released already or

318
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,880
not but it's getting merged

319
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,040
but the problem is here as i said there

320
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,199
are very few neutrino enable

321
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,760
nodes in the internet so we just started

322
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,320
running our own

323
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,519
so on each physical box we have one

324
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,760
compact filter server and many lnds

325
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
and this mostly works because it

326
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,680
synchronizes very fast it's local on the

327
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,360
same machine so it

328
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,110
just uses all the bandwidth

329
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,240
[Music]

330
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,160
the current features of sphinx

331
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,639
there are apps for desktop on all the

332
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,480
major platforms

333
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,060
as well as an ios and android app

334
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,000
[Music]

335
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,800
what is cool for example on ios when you

336
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,079
connect your phone to the sync server

337
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,000
it stores all the credentials in the

338
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
keychain and then you can just open your

339
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,079
mac

340
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,680
and use the same it's

341
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,079
use the same messages the messages are

342
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,279
encoded in the tlv

343
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,320
which can now be read through the

344
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,839
api there is still message size limit

345
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,720
because of the

346
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,920
maximum size of a lightning payment

347
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,399
we have utf-8 support and gifts

348
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,079
you can send payments and payment

349
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,160
requests and

350
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,720
you can do paid content for example if i

351
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,199
have a

352
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,320
group chat i'm a content producer i want

353
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
to post a picture and

354
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,560
get paid for people watching this

355
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,519
picture

356
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,839
i can set a price in satoshis on the

357
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,519
picture and people have to pay before i

358
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,920
can see the picture

359
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,880
it's it's stored on servers which are

360
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,000
called meme servers

361
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,680
we have end-to-end encryption when you

362
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,600
first connect to someone there is a key

363
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,120
exchange

364
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,360
so the chat and all the content is

365
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,880
encrypted

366
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
and there are tribes tribes are special

367
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
kind of groups it's like public groups

368
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,360
there is a

369
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
directory online you can just conduct

370
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,839
your code to join a group

371
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,040
and they have embedded security which we

372
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,759
suffer from on telegram every day in our

373
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,880
groups

374
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,079
with spam you can set a price to join

375
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,399
you can set a price to send a message

376
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,079
and you can set a

377
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,720
price to stake for every message so when

378
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,160
you send the message

379
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,240
your money will be held for a period of

380
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,040
time and then released

381
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,560
of course this is all optional if you

382
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,800
want a free group you can do a free

383
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,759
group

384
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,000
and we have patreon style subscriptions

385
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,600
i'm a podcaster i want people to pay for

386
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
premium content i can have a widget on

387
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,160
my

388
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,120
website and people can just scan this

389
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,600
widget

390
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,120
and subscribe to my content

391
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,880
or just a free subscription i have

392
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,639
people just sending me

393
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,240
automatically money from a lightning

394
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,320
wallet every week for example

395
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,040
on the app and yeah this is a

396
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
most recent addition the authentication

397
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,320
api and bots actually

398
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,000
so anything you would expect from a

399
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
modern app which

400
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,000
creates an identity it's totally

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
pseudonymous

402
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,280
you can use whatever name you want on it

403
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,679
and even the people who add you on the

404
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,720
app can use it

405
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
each person can use a different name for

406
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,959
every person for yourself

407
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,000
and now you can use things to

408
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,240
authenticate yourself like we would do

409
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,160
with google alt or facebook alt on

410
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,359
other applications and websites and also

411
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,640
there is bot support

412
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
it's basically anything that runs with

413
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
telegram you copy past the code and it

414
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,520
will run

415
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,360
all things

416
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,720
they also wanted to create

417
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,960
a standard for chat and content over

418
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,600
lightning

419
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,160
it's called the lumo standard um it's

420
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,440
unfortunately not

421
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,559
used by people like juggernaut uh

422
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,760
so the two chat platforms are

423
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,240
incompatible with

424
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,600
each other but i'm hoping to see people

425
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,280
using at least a part of this standard

426
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,520
so we can have other chat apps

427
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,400
working with things we still have some

428
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,440
challenges

429
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,480
uh routing again

430
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,000
now abc usually works a b c d

431
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,320
still some failures uh also

432
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,679
we noticed that uh when you create a

433
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,799
channel

434
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,480
actually the age of the channel

435
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,880
influences the probability that it will

436
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,160
route payments

437
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,760
we call that channel aging usually after

438
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,000
24 hours a channel becomes really good

439
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,120
at forwarding payments

440
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
because it's better known in the

441
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,280
lighting graph

442
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
the footprint for the server is still

443
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,360
pretty big

444
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,640
mostly cpu not so much ram and disk

445
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,120
we are working on reducing it and until

446
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,039
lnd011 there was a bug i think it was

447
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,120
introduced in 010

448
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,080
i call it the spontaneous channel clause

449
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
just channels force clause for no reason

450
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,679
on the node

451
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,760
and yeah we are in the process of

452
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,840
migrating to 0 11 which is supposed to

453
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,559
fix that uh

454
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,640
we have told support in ios and android

455
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,200
uh ios is still not released but android

456
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
is released

457
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,559
so you can connect to your if you run

458
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,480
the sphinx server on your home node

459
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,880
like an order for example you can

460
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,640
connect over to

461
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,679
and we wanted very much to have all the

462
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,080
lightning nodes running tor only

463
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,720
but actually that makes them unreliable

464
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,480
as so

465
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,960
it's not yet and yeah

466
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,880
you know what is more scarce than

467
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,360
bitcoin in this world ipv4s

468
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,280
yeah we have a huge problem a block of

469
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,080
1000

470
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,240
ipv4 costs 20 000

471
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,840
and there are not many to sell and

472
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,880
basically you

473
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,919
you would have to run one node for one

474
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,640
ipv4 we are not doing that we are

475
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,280
sharing

476
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,799
one ipv4 for 50 lmds

477
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,679
so if you look at anyoneml.com or any

478
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,159
other

479
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,559
lighting explorer you will see that all

480
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,679
the nodes

481
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,360
have like different port numbers because

482
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,440
we have a different port number for each

483
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,760
node

484
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,880
so the app is obviously used to interact

485
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,000
with stack workers

486
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,039
already said that and now about the

487
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,960
the reasons um

488
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,080
we said paul is into keto

489
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,919
and carnivory and

490
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,080
yeah we can expect in the coming years

491
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,440
that things like

492
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
meat will be heavily taxed

493
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
and we need places where the producer

494
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,880
will be able to sell directly to the

495
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,240
consumer

496
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,440
without any intermediaries and

497
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,159
yeah it can obviously be also used for

498
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,120
illegal goods

499
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,640
or soon to be illegal look good

500
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,360
legal and yeah and when encryption is

501
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,320
great for coordinating delivery and just

502
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,400
agreeing on the price or something um

503
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,679
and yeah but you could basically

504
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,720
do an automatic selling shop

505
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,760
uh now in sphinx and people just pay

506
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,840
interact to the chat and pay

507
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,240
what really convinced me when he talked

508
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,919
about this project first time

509
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,760
he he didn't know about

510
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,240
this book probably remember it

511
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,440
and i think strings is the gamma

512
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,080
communities

513
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,960
which paul rosenberg invented and yeah i

514
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
i think this is really uh where we

515
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,360
should be going maybe with

516
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,919
other technologies of course but this

517
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:10,400
one

518
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,440
kind of works now and you can run it

519
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,120
it's fully open so you can run it on

520
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,200
your own nodes

521
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,600
and the more people have on the app the

522
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,640
better

523
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,240
yeah so this is an example of the

524
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
donation widget you can do

525
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
there is a page to generate widgets you

526
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,679
just enter your info and it

527
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,240
automatically generates a nice widget

528
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,440
and

529
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,280
yeah coming soon app integration

530
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,960
for payment and authentication so you

531
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,559
could use things

532
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,600
as a route of trust for your

533
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,799
digital identity uh just based on your

534
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,840
lightning pop key

535
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,039
and yeah you can basically do anything

536
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,039
requiring privacy and

537
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,080
running with this app

538
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,400
and this is post contribution to the

539
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,919
talk

540
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,400
uh he he really sees it like a

541
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,799
foundation for a new internet based on

542
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,679
electronic money

543
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,840
and so

544
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
i'll let you read this one because i

545
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:37,840
can't talk about it

546
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,918
you

547
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,919
i think this is a conclusion for the

548
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,559
previous trade

549
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,799
should never forget that in the place

550
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,440
so close to europe i mean european union

551
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,679
because it's part of europe

552
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,440
things like that can still happen in

553
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,320
2020

554
00:24:44,640 --> 00:25:01,840
so if you have any questions

555
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,840
so thank you for talk get to minor

556
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
so guys you have any questions please

557
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,840
raise your hands and um there are also

558
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,640
some questions

559
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,159
online uh don't worry to ask folks

560
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,120
even if you're online

561
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,919
it was really touching with the belarus

562
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,520
um thank you for that

563
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
i organ and i i feel you in august i

564
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,039
organized for

565
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,440
a protest uh uh against blowers in the

566
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,240
regime

567
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,279
and this is but uh we were talking about

568
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:39,919
there is

569
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,640
so uh lighting is really early um lnd

570
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,600
has so much

571
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,400
issues with so some of the topics you

572
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
touched on i wanted to ask

573
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,279
um um

574
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,120
uh what uh so what is it what is the

575
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
current development what

576
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,240
challenge are you working on now

577
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,200
now the real challenge is scaling the

578
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,760
platform because the

579
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,120
the real cost to run each sphinx node is

580
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,559
much higher than the price we are

581
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,279
planning to ask people to pay for it

582
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,919
so yeah we are trying to optimize by any

583
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,960
means possible

584
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,159
the quantity of lnds we can stuff on one

585
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,200
physical server um

586
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,559
and yeah there is ipv4 issue but yeah so

587
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,640
it's funny because like crypto and

588
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,080
bitcoin is such an

589
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,120
advanced topic but guys

590
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,200
ipv6 please

591
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,840
yes like ipv6 bitcoin is close to

592
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,200
inexistent

593
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
um do you think maybe onion would be the

594
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,440
uh i mean just

595
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,360
because i'm running like whatever much

596
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,880
notes i don't have any uh

597
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,720
any clearance ip address i have only

598
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,000
onion addresses because

599
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,720
i mean it's easier and not all of the

600
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,279
normal uses have uh public ips if they

601
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:55,679
have

602
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,840
home internet for example many isps do

603
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,720
this thing

604
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,760
so maybe there are issues with torah do

605
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,880
you think it could be

606
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,559
like everything behind torrent could

607
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,400
work for um

608
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
that was the initial plan in berlin when

609
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,720
we spawned the first nodes they were all

610
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,000
running on little on the on the

611
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,360
lightning protocol side uh the problem

612
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,000
is so

613
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,640
channel opening with clear node clearnet

614
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,520
nodes of course

615
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,600
it's you have to connect before they can

616
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
channel back

617
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,279
and that's half of an issue but the real

618
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,640
issue is

619
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,000
um there's kind of a segmentation

620
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,640
between

621
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,360
tor lightning and clear net lightning

622
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,200
and basically when you try to interact

623
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,039
between the two the routing just doesn't

624
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,159
work

625
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,559
it's it's always comes back to the to

626
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,159
the routing issue

627
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,240
we need some i don't know the creator of

628
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,799
bgp to work on lightning maybe to fix it

629
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,720
because

630
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,039
yeah the the route the routing that is

631
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,240
in lnd i didn't try other

632
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,000
implementations but at least in lnd the

633
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,880
routing is up

634
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,679
and way too pessimistic but that's now

635
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,399
fixable

636
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,360
by configuration

637
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,240
okay so we have a questions online from

638
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,000
michael um

639
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,440
what about using out of band

640
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,480
non-ip transports if ipv is a problem

641
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,559
there are some interesting projects

642
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,600
using uh subs gigahertz similar to

643
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,000
lo modulation of rf

644
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,679
for similar communication applications

645
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,559
yeah i mean rf for bitcoin

646
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,039
probably rf for lightning it's way too

647
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,520
interactive of a protocol you need to

648
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,919
keep synced with the graph the gossip

649
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,480
protocol is very heavy

650
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,720
one thing we are trying to do is like to

651
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
copy the graph from

652
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,200
one node to another to spawn them faster

653
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,720
uh maybe we could like

654
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,960
make a group of nodes that they will be

655
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,880
isolated from the internet and only one

656
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,399
node on the outside that's basically

657
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,760
what we are

658
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,320
kind of doing because as you can imagine

659
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,080
the nodes we host

660
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,320
they have all channels to one routing

661
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,399
mode which we

662
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,840
manage uh so we have like this proxy

663
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,679
infrastructure and then all the leaf

664
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,880
nodes

665
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,679
running behind

666
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,480
i mean we could probably use private

667
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,960
channels

668
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,039
at least in this last segment

669
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,720
but this would need a rewrite of a part

670
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,279
of the app

671
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,200
okay um any any physical question do we

672
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,919
have still

673
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,760
still have a time for some questions

674
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,960
folks yeah um anybody

675
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,760
uh so maybe um i was thinking there is

676
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,720
also

677
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,960
some uh um people from neem today and

678
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,679
uh um do you think maybe on the broader

679
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,559
level of

680
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,640
issues with tor and lightning definitely

681
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,399
neem could be an esper i know that

682
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,399
you work with samurai zuma also has some

683
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,080
collaboration with neem

684
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,240
do you think there could be some

685
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,279
potential

686
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,480
solutions yeah maybe i mean samurai is

687
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,919
very anti-lightning so

688
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,760
not gonna happen but yeah we are very

689
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
heavily tall

690
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,279
i mean recently like thor is uh

691
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,080
having issues by itself anyway like

692
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,679
every time i open my wallet i have to

693
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,840
restart my hidden services on the server

694
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,200
side because they are just

695
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,240
unreachable for any reason

696
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,960
and yeah last two days miraculously it

697
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,799
worked every time i tried but like

698
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,600
usually i'm restarting tall every

699
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
two days

700
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,600
yeah maybe i don't know garlic routing

701
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,360
instead of onion rotting

702
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,679
i know there is some work happening in

703
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:05,840
this space

704
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,320
uh but i love the approach because it's

705
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,720
um you know this lmpd philosophy or the

706
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,559
layer link philosophy we have another

707
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,840
messaging layer

708
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,279
and uh on lighting basically so so i

709
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,399
like the approach

710
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,320
um yeah so what do you think about other

711
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,120
projects like

712
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,600
this from this ln pvp swear like rgb and

713
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,360
what maximolovsky is doing

714
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,840
i don't know them enough um i have

715
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,080
trouble already keeping up with all the

716
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,600
like base layer projects yes so yeah

717
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,120
i'm planning to look into rgb soon uh

718
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,640
probably before the end of the year but

719
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,240
yeah i didn't work with it yet

720
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,799
also one thing we are not doing very

721
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,240
much in

722
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,960
in bitcoin is using udp instead of tcp

723
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,440
i will keep it short because it's very

724
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,240
boring but

725
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,440
basically when you transport tcp on top

726
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,559
of another tcp

727
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,679
session things get bad because of

728
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,120
auto adjustment of the

729
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,320
protocols so yeah it would be

730
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,880
would be better to have like a udp tour

731
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,120
equivalent in the bottom and then have

732
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,880
a tcp session on top of it

733
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,519
that's usually what you do with vpns you

734
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,600
keep the base layer udp to

735
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,799
to avoid these timing issues uh there's

736
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,080
online question uh

737
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,240
could running sphinx relay on the

738
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,320
routing node pose a problem

739
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,600
uh how about resource usage

740
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,360
um resource are very

741
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,480
i mean it's like the whole

742
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,320
package lnd plus the sphinx relay

743
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,519
runs on 500 megs of ram with the 4 os

744
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,159
and everything so it's very tiny i mean

745
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,279
if you already have a

746
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,519
lightning node adding the sphinx relay

747
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,799
on top is

748
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,559
close to zero yes yes

749
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,960
yes so it will be another software

750
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,320
running on my node with

751
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,840
uh btc and and yeah you're just opening

752
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
another port for the api all

753
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,320
just a hidden service if you want to use

754
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,880
store

755
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:25,840
yeah yeah i love it good um

756
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,480
yeah there's a question um

757
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,159
hi at first thanks for your work i

758
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,440
quite like uh sphinx and even stuck work

759
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,080
is pretty cool project i would like to

760
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,279
ask you if you have some

761
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,679
strategy how to get a critical mess of

762
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,200
users

763
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,440
meaning to to be able to continue with

764
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,159
the development

765
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,279
sorry i didn't get the first meaning uh

766
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,679
for example haven app and open bazaar

767
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,640
seems to maybe stop

768
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,000
stop uh working on like i i don't know

769
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,799
but

770
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,760
there's possibility so my question is

771
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,000
whether you prevent somehow this uh

772
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,359
i don't know to if you have a lot of

773
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,440
enough funds to further further

774
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,560
development or

775
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,280
if you have some strategy how to how to

776
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,560
get the

777
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,839
critical mass of users um

778
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,159
the the main reason why we don't on

779
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,760
board many users

780
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,639
now is still some issues with the

781
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,079
onboarding process itself

782
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,119
like every time we think we are ready we

783
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,679
try to add like 50 users and everything

784
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,839
crashes

785
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,839
we are adding like new checks every day

786
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,239
to check the status of each node to be

787
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,639
sure that it's ready to

788
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,839
for user to subscribe

789
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,760
but i mean i think now the main

790
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,079
the main way to scale up is just having

791
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,040
people who run

792
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,359
their own lnd already to just install

793
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,560
the relay and

794
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,359
use their own nodes and all the hosted

795
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,598
nodes

796
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,839
okay thanks

797
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,560
uh thank you for talk so i have a

798
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,440
question

799
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,760
maybe it's kind of stupid i don't know

800
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,560
uh

801
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,599
so if you like foresee uh that something

802
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:33,920
like

803
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,280
paul rosenberg's uh gamma market can

804
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,480
arise uh using these technologies uh

805
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,359
how do we tackle the problem of like uh

806
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,000
sending

807
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
stuff in the physical space like this

808
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,280
could be

809
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,480
great for in-person trade and like

810
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,599
remote services but uh just

811
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,760
recently i learned my friend got sent

812
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,640
some beef liver from keto aurelius from

813
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,920
united states

814
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,119
and it's basically banned in european

815
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,240
union to

816
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,040
receive any meat products from outside

817
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,920
of you

818
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,359
so like um do you have any idea

819
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,880
like how this could be tackled yeah so

820
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,920
obviously

821
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,240
shipping things especially long distance

822
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,040
is a

823
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,480
is a mess and it's complicated

824
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,160
there's a guy here i think he's pretty

825
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,500
good at drop gangs and stuff

826
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,640
[Music]

827
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,040
but yeah long distance is a is a problem

828
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,880
there's also let's call it

829
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,640
onion shipment

830
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,880
can help through jurisdictions which are

831
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,240
more permissive or

832
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,440
through countries which are more

833
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,880
permissive for example

834
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,720
to compare two very close countries

835
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,160
france you can

836
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,480
import almost anything and no one will

837
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,079
check if it's

838
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,359
under a certain weight and size and in

839
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,240
luxembourg

840
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
if it doesn't have the correct sticker

841
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,480
on the device inside the box where you

842
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,200
just

843
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,599
keep it until you physically go to the

844
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,599
customs office and glue the sticker on

845
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,680
the box

846
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,000
so yeah i mean that's also why we are

847
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,599
shipping the noodles from france

848
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,960
because uh for 90

849
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,599
of the countries in the world we go uh

850
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,000
through

851
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,240
customs without any payments from our

852
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,520
customers

853
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,000
and i know that uh for example if you

854
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,760
send the same things from italy

855
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,040
or from switzerland we are almost sure

856
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,560
that everybody will be paying customs

857
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,640
and not on the declared value but on the

858
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:51,839
perceived value by the customs office

859
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,640
maybe i would ask um so you mentioned

860
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,240
there is the authentication

861
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,440
um api uh in in the app uh

862
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,079
for for like uh authenticate things yeah

863
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,440
uh yeah i'm thinking is it like

864
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,520
compatible does it work with ln url

865
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,200
authorification which is using so you're

866
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,640
using the uh

867
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,520
identity of your node yeah uh so it's

868
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,280
entirely in the sphinx

869
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,440
chart layer it's not using any lng

870
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,320
features

871
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,400
yeah yeah but uh so would because i'm

872
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
thinking it would be nice to have it

873
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,760
compatible to have the same energy if

874
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,720
i'm using

875
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,119
that maybe use it through a url and then

876
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,800
yeah as far as i know they're trying to

877
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,599
make it like

878
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,240
compatible more like with mainstream

879
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,800
things

880
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,839
not bitcoin world uh yeah

881
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,839
one discussion we had at some point also

882
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,040
was like

883
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,839
uh do we even need in the apps which are

884
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:50,640
using sat

885
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,640
as a money back end to call it sats

886
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,800
or just i don't know in sensor for

887
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,480
example you have some

888
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,640
i don't remember the name of the coin

889
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,680
but obviously it's

890
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,119
just a database it's not a coin

891
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,680
and yeah it could use that as a back end

892
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,720
for storing the money but

893
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,680
the user of a game or the chat app

894
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,920
doesn't need to know that it's using

895
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,200
lightning behind or sat it can be just

896
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,720
uh sphinx coin and token

897
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,680
and yeah we know that it's using

898
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
lightning and we

899
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,040
create adoption and people will be

900
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,720
building apps on top of it

901
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,960
but i mean the person you meet on the

902
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,480
street doesn't need to know anything

903
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,320
about that

904
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,920
and i think it's also what will be

905
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,599
driving bitcoin adoption in the future

906
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,480
like is

907
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,760
using bitcoin as a transport

908
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,119
layer or as a base layer to build apps

909
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:49,680
but

910
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,399
without calling it yes this is

911
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,960
yeah i love that project i don't have to

912
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,480
even know what technology is behind it

913
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,760
but it works for me and

914
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,240
yes uh are there any other questions

915
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,280
from uh

916
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,960
offline or online

917
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,839
we have a three more minutes

918
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,839
i can rant more about routing if you

919
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,040
want sorry

920
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,220
i can run more about lightning routing

921
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,709
[Laughter]

922
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,480
yeah one thing we've seen recently is

923
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,560
like you try to make a payment

924
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,040
it fails it says no route but if you do

925
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,920
query routes

926
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,319
it succeeds it gives a success

927
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,560
probability of 90

928
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,599
like why

929
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,480
i would love like to be able just to go

930
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,880
into the lnd database and say like

931
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,760
i know this route is valid uh i mean you

932
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,560
can't give

933
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,240
routing hints but it's unpractical on

934
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,640
the big scale

935
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,040
but like just assume that it will go

936
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,880
through and try sending it instead of

937
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,200
failing

938
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,280
yes i have always have this issue when

939
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,440
i'm rebalancing channels and so i find

940
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,240
some root

941
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,119
and it it is good but when i execute it

942
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,560
and it doesn't go through and there is

943
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,480
one channel which will fail and

944
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,040
yeah and also if you look at 50

945
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,119
different lightning nodes uh they

946
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,640
there are no two nodes which have the

947
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,900
same graph

948
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,520
[Music]

949
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,359
it's like it's they are supposed to know

950
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,240
the full graph but they actually

951
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,000
do like 90 plus 95 of the graph

952
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,920
um maybe what do you think about privacy

953
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,319
online network or for example lnd i was

954
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,720
met at lnd because i opened a channel

955
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,439
and it

956
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,720
did necessary import heuristic just just

957
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,640
put me there a bunch of coins that

958
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,240
wasn't that i did

959
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,319
not needed and destroyed my privacy you

960
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,599
know uh so

961
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,880
the the question is what do you think

962
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,960
about like this privacy layer maybe some

963
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,079
coin control for for

964
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,400
lightning but also uh general

965
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,160
so rather on the on chain wallet of

966
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,560
ln of lightning yes yes or i mean

967
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,160
because opening a channels and these

968
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,319
merging coins what can happen it's like

969
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:16,960
on train

970
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,839
privacy but yeah so now you have psbt in

971
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:20,640
lnd

972
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,079
but uh it it allows you to do some nasty

973
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:24,960
things and

974
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,440
mistakes uh not not a big fan actually

975
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,480
of it

976
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,520
like there was that guy who uh so if you

977
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,680
go to one ml you sort the

978
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,560
the nodes by channel count we are on top

979
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,880
because of the number of sphinx node

980
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,720
and so people see that and they open

981
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,560
channels because we have big

982
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,599
nodes with a lot of channels and one guy

983
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,200
opened like a bunch of channels using

984
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,920
psbt so to open many channels in one

985
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,280
transaction

986
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,960
and then he rbf'd and actually when your

987
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,680
rbf

988
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,920
channel opening what happens is the

989
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,520
payment goes through

990
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,640
but the receiving node doesn't know

991
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,640
which channel to associate it with so

992
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,480
there is no channel and the payment went

993
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,200
through

994
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,440
and we had to use some very nasty tool

995
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,640
to

996
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,800
roll back the transaction actually send

997
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,000
the money back to the guy

998
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,520
uh because it just stays in limbo it's

999
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,800
not on your own chain

1000
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,880
uh wallet and it's not in a channel it's

1001
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,680
like nowhere

1002
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,760
oh yeah don't rbf your channel opens

1003
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,000
so and uh so you you mentioned that you

1004
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,200
were working with alan d

1005
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,319
uh or finishing or do you have a time

1006
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,079
do you have time just last question

1007
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,079
maybe uh that you are working with alan

1008
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,640
d maybe uh if you um

1009
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,400
did you pick it or you mentioned lnd but

1010
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,480
what about c lightning eclair

1011
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,000
whatever so there was a lot of time

1012
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,839
invested in in

1013
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,800
lnd but yeah definitely we were looked

1014
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,079
how to run the

1015
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,560
same app layer on top of all the

1016
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,680
implementations i mean

1017
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,440
we the sphinx developers not

1018
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,640
me and but yeah

1019
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,960
i think well something was missing in c

1020
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,760
lighting but

1021
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,720
it's there now so we could probably do

1022
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:08,960
that

1023
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,800
one thing just one thing i don't like in

1024
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,720
c lighting is like the

1025
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,760
uh the peer id

1026
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,839
is a unique key in the c lightning

1027
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,920
database so you can't open two channels

1028
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,839
to the same

1029
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,520
and that's a big problem for us

1030
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:37,839
maybe rust lightning

1031
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,079
you
