00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,960
thank you

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,080
um so thank you for having me in

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
uh the conference and today i would

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,960
uh give an overview of the um digital

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,960
protest tactics in hong kong

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,680
which some of you might be familiar um

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,720
you know that

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,199
hong kong activists are heavily using

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,439
the telegrams and also our

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,560
all other digital tour to enhance their

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,679
protest tactics

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,160
so i will just give a quick overview of

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,800
the

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
different tactics we use and evaluate

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,120
the effectiveness

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,120
and then raise a couple bonds about the

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,879
risk and bottleneck that we have

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:43,760
encounter

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,280
in the past 15 months

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,520
hong kong has become a very different

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,640
place

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,160
since the initial protest in

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,760
june last year in 2019

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,079
the repressions from the governments and

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,719
also the surveillance tour

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,280
um that are used by the government has

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,000
rapidly

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,600
enforced it and we are facing a lot of

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,320
bottleneck

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,840
even we are uh using all those digital

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,520
tours to try to overcome

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,000
and create uh to try to overcome those

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,200
difficulties

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,560
and and trying to create a massive

36
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,600
decentralized movement

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,960
um so i would uh take a deep dive in

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,479
evaluating this uh tour's effectiveness

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,840
risk and bottleneck and frankly i'm not

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
a hacker so i don't have all the answers

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,520
about how to mitigate

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,200
a risk and bottleneck but i hope that

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,840
uh this overview can also give us a

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,880
sense of

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,079
um how this protest tour is used

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,040
in reality and how we can improve them

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,920
in the future

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,479
so that we can enhance the power of the

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,360
people

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,439
in overcoming their tyrannies of the

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,640
regimes

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,320
and lastly um this is was somewhat a

53
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
philosophical discussion but i feel it

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,399
is also important

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080
um in advancing our capacity

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,959
as activists as change makers and as

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,000
hackers

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
who want to change um the system that we

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
are forced to live in

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,080
that is uh in the past social movement

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,280
is perceived or situated in a framework

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,920
of

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,879
civil disobedience so when we talk about

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,080
the protest when we

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,959
talk about um people who are gathering

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,720
on the street we often reference

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,319
ourselves as

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,519
uh you know legacies of gandhis or

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,160
you know mlk marvin luther kings and

70
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,360
with reference to

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
their protest tactics and strategies and

72
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,959
their framework

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,760
to justify our law breaking behaviors

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,360
um but i'm seeing more and more

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
a departure between um digital

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,000
civil disobedient and conventional civil

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,280
disobedient

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,560
so resistant in digital

79
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,319
ram like like hacking like ddos

80
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,840
like um the digital tour we use in the

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
hong kong protest

82
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,480
are often seen as cyber crimes rather

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,040
than

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,200
civil disobedience and by

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,799
not having by not asserting legitimacies

86
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,200
to the protesters who engaged the

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,239
tactics

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,760
it actually diminishing the moral

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,360
uh legitimacy and also the powers of the

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,080
people

91
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,640
so i think you know i would uh spend

92
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,319
like five minutes on

93
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,599
um this philosophical discussion again i

94
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,959
don't have a lot of

95
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,519
answer to this question but i feel like

96
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,120
if we want to continue

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,599
our struggle if we conti want to scale

98
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,319
up

99
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,519
our capacities in uh resistant in the

100
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,720
digital realm

101
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,280
we need to talk about how to assert more

102
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,560
legitimacy

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
how to reclaim um

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,280
legitimacy for our behaviors

105
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,720
in the future so without further ado

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,840
let's do a quick overlook um

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
of the both aesthetics and also the

108
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,238
strategies of the movement

109
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,680
so as many of you already know that the

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,560
movement in

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,759
the protest movement in hong kong begins

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,240
in

113
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,360
june 2019 and it was largely

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,639
a face net networked movement

115
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
and also it is decentralized in its

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,639
nature

117
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,759
meaning that there's no single um

118
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,720
protest

119
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,759
or social movement organization leading

120
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
the decision-making effort

121
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,639
or coordinating logistics and resources

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,520
to

123
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,639
um to mobilize people on the street it

124
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,479
was rather

125
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,919
mobilized by different uh uh like

126
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,680
small knots of protest groups and also

127
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,240
alternative citizens who perform

128
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
different functions in a movement

129
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,680
um and that has created

130
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,039
an unprecedented large scale

131
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,080
of uh uprising in town

132
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,880
where more than one third of the

133
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,240
population

134
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,280
has in certain point uh passing the pay

135
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,560
in the uh movement in the in the past 15

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,199
months

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,320
and it has created a huge crisis to not

138
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,840
just the hong kong government

139
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,639
but also the chinese government um and

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,520
the protests

141
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,720
although it is uh diminishing uh the

142
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
uh the protest actions is diminishing

143
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,759
during a

144
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,800
covert time um the protest and the

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
resistance

146
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
is still continuing um and another

147
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,440
future

148
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,680
and another features of these uh

149
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,639
decentralized

150
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,759
movement in hong kong is most of the

151
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,280
consensus building

152
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,479
is based on online deliberations

153
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,600
um and it all it uh

154
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,639
while this online deliberation happens

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,520
and occurs

156
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
in telegrams in online forum it is

157
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,240
also inferencing more traditional actor

158
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,360
like media like political elites and

159
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,199
also the state

160
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,479
so you can say it is a relatively new

161
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,400
forms of social movement

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,280
that there's no single leader who can

163
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,479
act as the

164
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,120
representatives of the protest movement

165
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,160
and thus

166
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
it makes that it makes the regime even

167
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,919
more difficult

168
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,759
to um to strike on one single leaders

169
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,759
or to arrest a single leader and try to

170
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,520
stop the movement

171
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,240
uh and lastly pascal participants have a

172
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,039
relatively

173
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,759
higher sense of ownership and autonomy

174
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,759
in designing their actions

175
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,960
and in designing their protest tactics

176
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,400
and uh it it caused some positive impact

177
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,080
right at the same time some negative

178
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,599
impact but i will go through the

179
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,199
negative one

180
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,319
later during the presentation um

181
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,080
so with higher autonomy um the momentum

182
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
of totals is actually longer

183
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,160
and higher in the past one protest

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,199
actions might last two or three days

185
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,039
but in in the past decade

186
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,560
what we've seen is protest cycle

187
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,440
has become longer so for example in

188
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,039
arabic spring

189
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
um the protest cycle is around 40 days

190
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,759
in

191
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,080
uh in the hong kong case it has been

192
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,199
a year long and in the belarus

193
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,479
resistance

194
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,039
um it has already and through more than

195
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,120
60 days of resistance

196
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,360
um so the protest cycle tends to be

197
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,319
longer

198
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,360
and uh the scale

199
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
of protest is also larger than before

200
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,000
now what are the communication

201
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
tour or what is the logic of

202
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,800
mobilization behind the

203
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,680
uh this very decentralized movement in

204
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,639
hong kong

205
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,919
so first of all it was enabled

206
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,440
by of course digital tour um so at least

207
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
during june

208
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,800
to october 2020 a lot of mobilizations

209
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
and choice of strategies

210
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
occurs in the loop that i'm presenting

211
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,080
on the powerpoint slides that

212
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,200
um first of all

213
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,320
the strategic discussions is

214
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,440
done in a online forum which is called

215
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,680
li hkg um we call it london in cantonese

216
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
so it is a online forum similar to

217
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,560
reddick and and then

218
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
after the potential decide on uh

219
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,959
you know whether they should do

220
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,360
occupation whether they should uh

221
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,720
uh do a uh city wide bouquet then

222
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,800
a lot of mobilization work and

223
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
coordination work

224
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
are done through telegram channel and

225
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,839
i guess most of you knows you know how

226
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,600
powerful telegram are

227
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,480
because of its capacities its huge

228
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
capacity to subscribers

229
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,920
and also is instant messaging uh it is

230
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,800
really helpful

231
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,959
in coordinating logistics while at the

232
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,480
same time called and they

233
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,519
mobilize uh uh the general public to

234
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,600
pass it a bit in a certain action

235
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
now after those actions are called

236
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,279
donated and mobilize it

237
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
then people tend to use social media to

238
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,959
express

239
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,279
uh how they feel about their actions and

240
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,040
they will also evaluate

241
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,279
the effectiveness of actions through

242
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,880
social media like instagrams and

243
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,000
facebook

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,519
um and again those feedback

245
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,920
would then channel back to online forums

246
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,720
and uh

247
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,240
all other online space and it helps the

248
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,079
uh organizers and protesters to refine

249
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,120
and to order their protest tactics

250
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,800
in the next wave so specifically

251
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,839
in the online forum there are several

252
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,560
features

253
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,079
that enable manifold discussions online

254
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,360
um in the uh most popular uh

255
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,560
li hkg forum the algorithms

256
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
has helped screen and sort the most

257
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
popular ideas

258
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,200
and help those ideas which most

259
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,320
uh the largest numbers of users so for

260
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,279
instance

261
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,480
um the criterias of having uh

262
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,920
one um forum threat

263
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
to be prioritized on the online forum

264
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,240
is how many unique real users

265
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
were engaging in the threat how many

266
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,920
wheels are done

267
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,120
how much reading time do the users spend

268
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
on one single thread

269
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,800
and how many total reaction including

270
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,320
like and dislike

271
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,680
um and also subscriptions to to a single

272
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,560
friend

273
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,959
so in a way this algorithm helps

274
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,040
remove those unpopular ideas or ideas

275
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,760
that didn't get a lot of traction

276
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
and prioritize those threats

277
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,079
that has more followers and

278
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,680
more engagements with

279
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,200
the users so whenever people

280
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,920
uh open the home page of the licg

281
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,200
on the top 10 fret they will see

282
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
the top 10 pro test protest

283
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,079
tactics that are discussing by

284
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,120
the united stands and that helped screen

285
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,560
out

286
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,959
a tactics that was more likely

287
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,040
pacificated by the citizens in town

288
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,320
and another features of richie

289
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,560
is also helping in controlling trolls

290
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,360
activities

291
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,720
um trolls is really a a problem uh when

292
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
it comes to online deliberation so

293
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,920
the states can employ a lot of trolls

294
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,120
and trying to disrupt

295
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,639
uh the conversation so

296
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,720
uh for riha only isp email

297
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,920
can be used to sign up as user and new

298
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,720
users

299
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,760
often has a tag on their

300
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,000
near to the username meaning feedback

301
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,440
so for people who are viewing

302
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,160
comments made by these new users who are

303
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,680
possibly trolls

304
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,079
people knows their new user people knows

305
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,079
they're not grounded in the community

306
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,079
and people's tends to ignore their

307
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,360
comment so it is this little mechanism

308
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
that helps the risk becomes important

309
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
of strategic discussion at least in the

310
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,839
beginnings of the

311
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,200
protest movement now not a lot of people

312
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,720
use this online forum as

313
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,200
strategic discussion nowadays because

314
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,839
new users who registered their account

315
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,160
in june last year has already become

316
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,040
old users now and then there are a lot

317
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,000
of trolls

318
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,560
who are like trying to disrupt and

319
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,160
spread demoralizing

320
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,880
uh message on this online role but at

321
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
least at the beginnings

322
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
of the protest movement it has become a

323
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
it have becomes a

324
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,360
important hub for strategic discussion

325
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,600
now uh since everyone knows how to use

326
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
diagram i'm not going through

327
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,160
the the functions of diagram but

328
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,680
telegram really helps

329
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,800
in two ways one it lower costs of

330
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,519
content

331
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,560
distribution as you can see on the left

332
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
hand side it is a telegram channel

333
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,000
that are joined by more than 280 000

334
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,279
members and so they

335
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,920
in a way they are a more effective tool

336
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,279
to spread

337
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,320
um protest action information

338
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,519
and also to coordinate logistics

339
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,800
than other traditional medias or a

340
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,639
facebook page of a protest groups

341
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,800
and another um effectiveness

342
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,839
of telegram is it also lower cost of

343
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,199
communication

344
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,320
because people can use bob to

345
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,880
call dna action so um

346
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
one of the protest tactics in hong kong

347
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,160
is

348
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,959
to galvanize international support and

349
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,160
to achieve

350
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,199
uh international support a lot of hong

351
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,040
kong people goes to twitter

352
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,639
and we tweet informations of the hong

353
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,079
kong protest

354
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,279
and that's when

355
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,480
telegram box helps because those bulbs

356
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,600
can help disseminate

357
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,639
which tweet to retweet

358
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,279
and also which tweets are trending on

359
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,959
twitter so that the hong kong people can

360
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,360
engage them

361
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,120
and then one quite unique features of

362
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,240
the hong kong

363
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,720
protest is because most of the

364
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
protesters and young people who are

365
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,480
gamers or digital native

366
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,760
the protest is some of the protest

367
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,800
tactics

368
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,000
is disseminated like a rpg

369
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,519
games um so on the left hand side you

370
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,560
can see

371
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,440
you know there are like a different

372
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,079
protest

373
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,440
role in the protest if you are a

374
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,040
peaceful protesters

375
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,959
then there are certain tasks you should

376
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,880
do and if you are

377
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,920
a firefighters meaning those

378
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,759
who will put their bodies on the front

379
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,680
line and extinguish

380
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,480
tear gas customers then there are like

381
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
several tasks they need to achieve

382
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,399
um so those tasks and also protest

383
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,279
knowledge

384
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,240
are open source on google doors and

385
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,519
website

386
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,959
and there are like a very detailed

387
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,320
instructions of

388
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,519
what the protesters wear and what gears

389
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,360
and equipment they should prepare before

390
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,959
they go into protest

391
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,279
so it feels like an open source protest

392
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,399
as

393
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,600
mentioned by professors in hong kong and

394
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,639
also like an lpg game that really helps

395
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,120
us to

396
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,839
flatten the protest tactics and protest

397
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,160
knowledge

398
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,839
um and another digital tour people would

399
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,800
use

400
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,959
is to crowd source intel so what you are

401
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,759
seeing in here is a live heat map

402
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,360
which shows the deployment of police

403
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,160
and uh also counter mobilization

404
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,759
um so it helps the protesters to uh

405
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,000
understand their environment and their

406
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,360
surrounding

407
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,720
and uh to identify a

408
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,480
safe uh route to retreat

409
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,359
and then you also have crowd source uh

410
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:11,679
uh

411
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,039
intel like dosing it um because

412
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,559
there are around 35 000

413
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,559
police officer in town many of them

414
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,679
have relatives who are potassium and the

415
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,439
protesters will send

416
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,640
informations and personal data names

417
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,520
address id numbers of those police

418
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,880
officer

419
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,400
to telegram channel as a way to deter

420
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,440
a violence of police officer it is

421
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,520
because when the identities of those

422
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,559
police officers

423
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,600
are that online they might

424
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,240
try to restrain their behavior because

425
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,360
their behavior

426
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,480
is watched by puppet eyes that

427
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,039
has become less effective throughout the

428
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,799
times and and i will explain why later

429
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,919
lastly there's also coordinations of

430
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,160
logistics so as you are seeing in this

431
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
news footage

432
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,360
a university campus is decisioned by

433
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,720
a policeman and the protesters

434
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,960
have coordinated a motorcycle

435
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,360
team and rescue those who are besieged

436
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,480
in this university campus um

437
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,320
so only through telegrams and a

438
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,919
cyber spay tour those tactics are able

439
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,679
to be employed and becomes a very

440
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,640
powerful tour in terms of coordinating

441
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,160
logistics in terms of

442
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,240
mobilizing protesters in

443
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,160
devoting their own resources

444
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
now let's go into some of the

445
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
effectiveness and

446
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,280
risk assessment first of all

447
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,600
this decentralized features of the

448
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,039
protest movement

449
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,480
has reshaped potential campaign as many

450
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,280
scholars

451
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,120
as race has pointed out in arab spring

452
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,440
and blm protests and also the latest

453
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,080
nebulon

454
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,760
uprising with so many people

455
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,960
engaging strategic discussions and also

456
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,320
coordination

457
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,520
work online it exaggerates large

458
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,799
scales protest moment um

459
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,039
so it's really easy that one singular

460
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,240
event might lead to a

461
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,360
massive 1 million people much or

462
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,559
you know 1 million people blockade

463
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,880
on the street which is something that

464
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,559
organizer in the past

465
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,760
wouldn't dare imagine it also helped

466
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,720
replicate protest tactics to spread

467
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,760
rapidly like memes online so

468
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,200
as i have mentioned those rpg games

469
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
type of protest menu has really helped

470
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,520
flatten protest tactics and help people

471
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,720
replicate

472
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,280
uh protest tactics in different parts of

473
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
town

474
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,480
also it uh one of the

475
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,880
po in the past protest campaign are

476
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,000
largely

477
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,240
led by professionals or middle class

478
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,039
or lawyers doctors like those figures

479
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,360
like mlks or gandhi

480
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,760
but when we are imposing in a more

481
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,000
decentralized protest

482
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,760
features people tends to be in covert

483
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,880
anonymous and decentralized

484
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,480
and aside from this characteristics

485
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,760
identified by other scholars in the past

486
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,640
decade

487
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,720
we are also seeing that the hong kong

488
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,000
model has also helped sustain grievances

489
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,039
and movement momentum by

490
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,720
carrying protest network in telegram

491
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,520
channel

492
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,880
and also other uh cyber space like

493
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
facebook groups

494
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,480
and um other social media platform

495
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,799
so originally one telegram channel

496
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,640
was set up for the purpose to mobilize

497
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,480
people on a single day and after

498
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,360
the day of action people will stay in

499
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,120
the telegram channel

500
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,320
and it becomes a potential resources for

501
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,679
the next wave

502
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,960
and that's what i mean by uh this

503
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,200
digital tour helps sustain grievances

504
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,520
and movement momentum

505
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,200
now and other features that also help

506
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,240
in galvanizing popular support

507
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,320
is a live blog classic

508
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,080
so let's not exaggerate the importances

509
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,640
of telegrams and online from actually

510
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
most of the people

511
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,200
engage like most of the protesters

512
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,159
engage

513
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,360
the protests through live bloc uh

514
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,520
live broadcasting in in hong kong

515
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,559
contests

516
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,640
and those are the information they they

517
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,559
receive those are the information shots

518
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,200
they receive

519
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,880
most and from our research

520
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,520
we observe a very interesting phenomenon

521
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,159
which is

522
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,159
the more live stream that the protesters

523
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,880
use the more they agree police

524
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,120
was using excessive use of force and

525
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,080
thus

526
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,080
it keeps them engaging in protest action

527
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,879
and help sustain the movement momentum

528
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,240
however there is also some negative

529
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,200
impact that we need to keep in mind

530
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,200
first of all because a mobilization tool

531
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,480
and coordination tour is flattened

532
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,559
and also open to

533
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,080
different factions and different

534
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,840
protesters

535
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,520
the feedback loop to a protest organizer

536
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,280
and the feedback loop to a single

537
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,840
protest

538
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,760
action is shortened so for instance

539
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,320
on online forum you will see online

540
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,039
threat

541
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,240
that says joshua wong which is like the

542
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,640
permanent protest fakers in hong kong

543
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
joshua won peace with this threat and

544
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,240
there were like

545
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,679
thousands of criticism to his

546
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,720
protest choice and his strategies

547
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,840
and georgia has to respond to

548
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,880
um this reactions and criticism on

549
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,159
facebook and also instagram um so in a

550
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,520
way

551
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,880
this shortened the feedback loop

552
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,279
could be harmful not always harmful but

553
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,880
it could be harmful

554
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,320
to a long-term protest strategy

555
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,240
where immediate impact or immediate

556
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,760
effectiveness of a single protection

557
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,960
might not appear immediately but

558
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,039
requires like time

559
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,799
so that's something that we need to keep

560
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,840
in mind on how to

561
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,919
uh achieve unities online

562
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,120
while at the same time provide space for

563
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,600
protest organizers so that they can plan

564
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,039
for more long-term protest strategies

565
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,720
also another locative impact is

566
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,799
the discourse that is pervading in

567
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,600
cyberspay or in telegram channel

568
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,039
is inherited uh is inheriting

569
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,240
uh pervading prejudice and social stigma

570
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,520
like sexism and homophobic so on your

571
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,960
right there is a like uh

572
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,640
uh like a protest act and

573
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,799
in order like it was an illustration of

574
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,400
uh protesters who are trying to uh

575
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,919
shame the police officers and

576
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,080
the way that they train to shame the

577
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,480
police officers and

578
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,600
arrive police is to claim

579
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,880
that while the police officers were

580
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,000
beating protesters on the street

581
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,159
their wife were having free pee

582
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,279
with other people at their home

583
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,400
um so it is very sexism

584
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,600
and it is inheriting some of the

585
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,039
social stigma and prejudice that

586
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,320
might be harmful to a movement

587
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,799
that fight for democracy so again this

588
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,400
is something that we need to

589
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
um need to prevent try to prevent and

590
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,720
also

591
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,400
now other risk

592
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,520
the decentralized movement is successful

593
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,799
in helping to coordinate

594
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,200
um protest logistics and also

595
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,320
disseminate uh

596
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,880
content so the police are start

597
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,760
targeting telegram channel administrator

598
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,679
and try to end their function as a

599
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,360
protest hub

600
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,159
so you can see in you know on the right

601
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,919
this is a telegram channel

602
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,840
that's shut down by the police the

603
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,840
police storm into the home of the

604
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,240
telegram channel admin

605
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,360
delete all the content of the uh channel

606
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,559
and post this picture that says

607
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,279
the content of this channel is removed

608
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,720
by the hong kong police

609
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,679
as a way to shame and also try to deter

610
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,559
other protesters

611
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,520
and through arresting the telegram

612
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,039
channel admin

613
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,919
those police officers were also able to

614
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,440
retreat personal data

615
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,320
of subscribers and also protest groups

616
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,039
so that they can arrest more people

617
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,720
uh in this protest network and

618
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,679
they were uh they achieved this through

619
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,080
uh forensic tours like sally by

620
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,200
x-way those

621
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,640
notorious tour uh that i think everyone

622
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,679
in here

623
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,279
has heard um

624
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,840
another way that uh police officer we're

625
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,640
trying to

626
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,520
uh use in responding this decentralized

627
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,480
movement

628
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,840
is to by torturing telegram channel

629
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,480
administrators so that they would give

630
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,520
up

631
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,760
uh their data or unlock their phone

632
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,360
unlock their computer

633
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,880
so this is something that we are

634
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,000
like challenged most you know most of

635
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,320
the telegram channel

636
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,080
administers and also alternative protest

637
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,320
protesters who engage in this digital

638
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,039
realm

639
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,760
are not professional hackers they could

640
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,480
be

641
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,679
engineers who are really familiar

642
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,480
uh some of the tactics in building

643
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
makeshift barriers

644
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,840
them could be a teachers who specialize

645
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,200
in

646
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,399
uh deploying uh social workers or

647
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,240
you know logistics or money to uh uh

648
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,640
a young protesters they don't

649
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,440
necessarily have the technical knowledge

650
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,480
in hiding their identities online

651
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,200
they don't know how to use tor they

652
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,960
might heard about toy but they don't

653
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,279
know how to use it effectively

654
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,320
so it is really up to professionals and

655
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,399
technicians to help them to

656
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,240
access to a tour that can easily be used

657
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
uh so that they can protect their

658
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,159
identity and thus

659
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,159
protect themselves from torture by the

660
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,640
police

661
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,120
there's also other bottleneck which is

662
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,360
reproducing weaponizations of legal

663
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,320
instruments

664
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,520
so in hong kong there is a very lot of

665
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,559
notorious uh criminal ordinance called

666
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,520
access to a

667
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
computer with criminal and dishonored

668
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,799
intent

669
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,440
which is quite similar to the computer

670
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,080
fraud and abuse ad in the us

671
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,200
it is hot is it fake it is deliberately

672
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,399
broad

673
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,600
and any crimes

674
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,559
that is related to a computer scan phone

675
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,559
can be used

676
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,760
by the police to charge like protesters

677
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,159
and not only that there are some legal

678
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,480
instruments that can be used

679
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,039
against protesters there's also this

680
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,159
droid enterprise

681
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,360
that criminality that the police were

682
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,520
tried the prosecutor that was trying to

683
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,320
use

684
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,840
to prosecute those who are supporting

685
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,039
logistics of the

686
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,440
uh movement so not only the

687
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,679
protesters who are on the front line

688
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,799
will be charged

689
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,720
rioting drivers

690
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,760
or motorcycle drivers who assist

691
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,200
escape or assist transportation

692
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,039
of protesters could also be criminalized

693
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,039
under destroy enterprise criminality

694
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,240
there is also called call colonial law

695
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,200
like in science or public nuisance that

696
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,440
the police that is highly

697
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,080
fake and abroad that can again

698
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,000
use to arrest activists and protesters

699
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,880
behind the scene and most importantly

700
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,000
in uh two months ago

701
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,200
china imposed a jokodian national

702
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,039
security law

703
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,320
which is very fake and broad and it will

704
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,799
force

705
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,520
isp internet service provider to give up

706
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,840
users data so again

707
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,520
as professional or a technician

708
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,640
or people who care about privacy and

709
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,720
digital security

710
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,080
we are racing against time to provide

711
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,919
more secure tour to protesters

712
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,120
to fight against this jacodian suffering

713
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,480
states that is trying to

714
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,520
monitoring everyone on their computers

715
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,679
lastly decentralization

716
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,240
although it might favors covert

717
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,399
anonymous operation

718
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,080
it might also leads to exaggerated fears

719
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,200
when phase went south it is because

720
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,960
most of those telegram channel

721
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,200
administrators are not known by the

722
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,840
public

723
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,399
they are not public figures they are not

724
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,320
connected with any ngos

725
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,840
or activist community before

726
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,880
the support they receive when they are

727
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,080
arrested

728
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,240
is much more smaller and the publicities

729
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,760
and uh information regarding uh to their

730
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,799
arrest

731
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,519
it's much more smaller than a

732
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,320
traditional uh social activist

733
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,799
so that has created an atmosphere of

734
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,159
right terror

735
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,480
and exaggerated fear because people

736
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,399
don't know what will happen to this

737
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,600
arrestee and

738
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,120
it is it has become a demoralizing

739
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,080
factor

740
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,600
to many protesters in town

741
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,720
now i'm uh like running over like i'm

742
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,000
running out of time

743
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,480
so i'm just going to briefly talk about

744
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,360
the philosophical discussions about

745
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,600
uh civil disobedience in a digital realm

746
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,840
there are several reasons why i think

747
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,600
normative discussions of digital

748
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,519
disobedience matters

749
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,000
first of all we are living in a time

750
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,799
where

751
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,360
the states have so many tools they have

752
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,200
their own hackers they have

753
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,039
massive surveillance tour they coerce

754
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,440
international first service provider to

755
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,600
give updaters of the users

756
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,880
they set up a jokodian civilian state

757
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,000
and we're there the technology level

758
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,200
of the state is out competing uh the

759
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,120
capacities of individuals

760
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,200
in a rapid place so in order

761
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,480
to carry out effective disruptive

762
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,679
tactics

763
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,880
we need to enhance our digital tour

764
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,519
and we need to invest more in our

765
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,480
digital

766
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,840
disobedient capacity second

767
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,159
theorists and legal community

768
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,279
media often disassociate digital

769
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,159
obedience

770
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,840
or hacktivism from glorified non-violent

771
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,200
struggle

772
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,480
feature by mlks and gandhi

773
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,760
and when those hackers arrested by the

774
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,720
state

775
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,640
with treason with ridiculously

776
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,399
dracodian's crime the respect

777
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,279
and protection from meteor from legal

778
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,240
community

779
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,600
is much much smaller than those

780
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,840
who put their body on the front line

781
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,120
blockading

782
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,840
uh a a building so there is a

783
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,799
disassociation between

784
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,799
how much care our community gave to

785
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,960
past practitioners of digital

786
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,919
disobedience

787
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,039
and ordinary conventional artifice and

788
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,919
this is a gap that we need to view

789
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,960
thirdly

790
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,679
top pick moral judgment could influence

791
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,000
discretions of law enforcement so

792
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,760
if more public if more general topic

793
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,040
resonate that digital disobedience is

794
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,239
legitimate

795
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,440
it might deter police officer or a

796
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,960
prosecutor

797
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,159
from using radical and

798
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,280
uh enhanced punishments against

799
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,320
those who engage a digital disobedience

800
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,040
and thus

801
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,599
it provide more protection for those who

802
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,960
engage in

803
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,079
digital disobedience lastly

804
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,119
not always sometimes

805
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,839
if we manage to assert legitimacy to

806
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,599
hackers and also digital disobedience

807
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,440
it might sometimes influence the outcome

808
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,520
of convictions and judicial pulses

809
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,400
because

810
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,240
judges although they don't want to bring

811
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,720
political discussion in courtroom

812
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,079
they are nonetheless social animals who

813
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,400
would influence by public discourse and

814
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,320
public conviction

815
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,800
so again it might help us create more

816
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,240
protection

817
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,760
to practitioner now

818
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,160
in a very conventional understandings of

819
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,520
civil disobedience

820
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,720
like ross a uh john walsh like a

821
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,200
legal scholar it says like civil

822
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,359
disobedience is public nonviolent

823
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,079
non-violent

824
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,359
consensuals and yet political ad contra

825
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,440
to the law usually done with the aim of

826
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,200
bringing about a change

827
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,119
and the law or policies of the

828
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,320
government

829
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,640
i don't really uh like uh

830
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,079
approve this criteria because i feel

831
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,839
like it is too thin and too demanding

832
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,240
under time where the states have such a

833
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,720
disproportion power against individuals

834
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,680
but even if we take this criteria five

835
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,800
minutes

836
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,320
yes okay yeah what's wrong with dbos

837
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,960
right it is non-violence what's wrong

838
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,760
with

839
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,359
uh people who are trying to shut down a

840
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,240
website of

841
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,000
a of a government when uh the

842
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,200
the uh the result is similar to you know

843
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
blockading a government building

844
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,280
right so i will stop it in here

845
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,079
and i hope you know in the future we can

846
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,640
assert more legitimacy to

847
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,480
uh like uh resistance in digital ram

848
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,200
and also come up with more solution that

849
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,240
we can

850
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,960
equip like encrypt protesters with more

851
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,760
tour

852
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,040
with more capacity in fighting

853
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,079
this totalitarian

854
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,480
regime thank you

855
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,440
yes so we can go to uh qna sections yes

856
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,880
exactly that's where we are can you hear

857
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,920
us

858
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,000
yes i can hear you perfect okay so is

859
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,359
there any question from the public so

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,560
maybe come here

861
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,440
and so you will

862
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,119

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,000
current state of the protests and

868
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,119
curious about uh

869
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,680
how has the hong kong government

870
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,480
affected

871
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,920
or influenced the ability of people to

872
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,040
be banked uh have they frozen accounts

873
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,640
are people um do you have do they have

874
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,040
uh

875
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,560
problem transacting are they using

876
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,880
cryptocurrencies or what's the state

877
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,400
in this right now

878
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,680
thank you it's available

879
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,359
uh johnson just try to wrap it up that's

880
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,200
a very broad question okay

881
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,480
okay okay yeah yeah so very briefly uh

882
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,320
the repression is enhanced with the

883
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,240
jacobian national security law

884
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,200
uh the government is using more severe

885
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,560
punishments against the protesters

886
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,160
and more than two thousand peoples are

887
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,640
either in trials or they receive their

888
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,760
convictions already

889
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,359
and some of them are charged with really

890
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,040
draconian's punishment

891
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,320
like 10 years in imprisonment so

892
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,400
there are a need of like in terms of

893
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,000
cryptocurrency not a lot of hong kong

894
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,760
people are using them but you know more

895
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,280
are trying to do

896
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
uh there are occasion which the

897
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
government did shut down

898
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,079
banned accounts of uh groups that are

899
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,480
trying to support the protest action

900
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,960
um so cryptocurrency could be one

901
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,040
solution but the problem is how do we

902
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,480
mainstream it right

903
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,520
and also how do you uh because you know

904
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,640
uh hong kong is

905
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,079
uh largely still using uh

906
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,880
you know paper currencies uh or you know

907
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,240
so-called states currency

908
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,520
um so how do you do the exchange like

909
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,640
with bitcoins with the legal ramp um

910
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,599
so that's the problem that we are facing

911
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,079
um

912
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,800
i also saw on the chat uh that there is

913
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
a question about how we can help as an

914
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,320
international community that

915
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,960
is kind of easy so you see the tool one

916
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,800
thing that you can really help is

917
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,560
uh in one of the powerpoint slides you

918
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,240
see the police were trying to use

919
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,040
different

920
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,079
forensic tour and hacking devices of the

921
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,560
protesters right and they all belongs to

922
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,160
foreign government like in the u.s or

923
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,000
like in the switzerland so by

924
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,560
blocking this tour from importing into

925
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,440
hong kong

926
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,839
it's one way that we can deter the

927
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,920
capacities of the police

928
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,119
um and and stop them from uh

929
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,680
like using uh enhanced technologies

930
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,400
again the

931
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,720
uh protesters and then there's also

932
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,240
other tactics like speak to your

933
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,440
representatives

934
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,640
impose more uh like uh policies or man

935
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,560
uh policies or uh uh or measures in

936
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,480
helping the protesters in hong kong

937
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,280
and also like um punishing the officials

938
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,240
in in

939
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,160
in hong kong in china those are the

940
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
methods that

941
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,720
other countries can consider

942
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,760
how do we protect ourselves against

943
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,920
impersonators

944
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,160
infiltrators and trolls so in in digital

945
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,599
ram that doesn't matter

946
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,440
right because uh most of the telegram

947
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,640
channel i mean they were just

948
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,880
disseminating information they were not

949
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,560
hoping to do like discussions on

950
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,720
telegram channel so it is

951
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,480
it isn't a problem that trolls or

952
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,400
infiltrator were

953
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,960
like uh uh participating in those

954
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,839
channels

955
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,760
because you know those information were

956
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,920
going to be public anyway

957
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,960
uh but then there are

958
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,400
there were like trolls and impersonator

959
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,720
like police did impersonate themselves

960
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,480
as potessa

961
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,040
during protest action and that has

962
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,480
created a huge problem that um

963
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,079
they were arresting people they were

964
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,000
beating people they were

965
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
uh following the more radicals

966
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,599
protesters

967
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,200
um so that's one thing that we have yet

968
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,760
uh resolved uh mitigate it

969
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,079
apart from the cause for democracy is

970
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,359
there any movement

971
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,079
favor in independence in hong kong yes

972
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:14,880
and

973
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,359
in hong kong independency has become

974
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,359
even more popular

975
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,640
than before one-third of the

976
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,960
younger population support the

977
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,119
efficacies of hong kong dependency

978
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,640
now there is called the jokodian

979
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,119
national security aims at

980
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,760
repressing this momentum and also

981
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,040
criminalizing

982
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,440
the efficacy like a mere advocacy online

983
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,560
or a mere speech online could get people

984
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,359
in jail

985
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,200
with this jokodian national security law

986
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,000
uh yeah it has the the current movement

987
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,520
has slowed it down because of the

988
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
coronal virus because of the social

989
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,720
distancing rule

990
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,280
and also because the police were

991
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,079
targeting

992
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,200
targeting telegram channel admin and try

993
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,000
to diminish

994
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,760
this this channel as a protest hub

995
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,560
so in the future we might need to

996
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,440
consider

997
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,839
like a hybrid mode hybrid model so

998
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,480
sometimes

999
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,240
we use uh uh digital like decentralized

1000
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,760
models of social movement

1001
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,440
and then sometimes you might need

1002
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,800
transitional social movement

1003
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,240
organization

1004
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,440
who are more usually more recipients

1005
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,520
uh against like repression um

1006
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,400
so i don't have a good answer in you

1007
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,319
know how the movement should go on

1008
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,280
but rest assured the movement is still

1009
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,240
continuing

1010
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,319
uh a lot of people are engaging in

1011
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,079
international advocacy

1012
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,319
while at the same time there are still a

1013
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,240
lot of restaurants and shops who are

1014
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,599
poor democracy

1015
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,680
and they often uh organize activities

1016
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,880
and action uh to voice out their support

1017
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,200
to

1018
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,160
democracy movement so the movement is

1019
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,359
not dying down

1020
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,280
we are just shifting other tactics and

1021
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,960
strategy uh

1022
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,079
under this uh like repressive regimes

1023
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,960
okay so i think uh time is up i will

1024
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,200
maybe give a last chance to the audience

1025
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,480
sitting here in prague

1026
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,599
if somebody has a question so welcome

1027
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,680
so this will be the last question okay

1028
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,359
okay

1029
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,440
um hi um it's very brave what you are

1030
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,119
doing and

1031
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,280
in hong kong and it's also the level of

1032
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,640
protest is

1033
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,599
very organized and well my question is

1034
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,359
could you see a future where

1035
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,920
like mere evidence of protest

1036
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,000
participation could have

1037
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,680
imp like long-term impact on

1038
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,960
living in the chinese world maybe

1039
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,400
do you think that people that are

1040
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,800
currently protesting might get banned

1041
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,319
from the chinese society

1042
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,520
or you know cancel somehow or have their

1043
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,520
wechat accounts like banned or

1044
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,040
similar yeah so

1045
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,400
i think hong kong is uh it's quite lucky

1046
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,440
that you know it's shows its

1047
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,720
its society has yet fully in

1048
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,760
uh integrated in chinese society that

1049
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
most of the hong kong protesters or hong

1050
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,040
kong earth doesn't use wechat

1051
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,200
and uh they have uh like different

1052
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,760
uh tours or private service to choose

1053
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,640
from

1054
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,760
so the government cannot punish uh

1055
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,319
those who doesn't support the government

1056
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,119
through

1057
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,160
uh canceling their social service or

1058
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,800
uh limiting from accessing to uh perfect

1059
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,160
goods

1060
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,000
this is however something that chinese

1061
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,599
government want to do in the future at

1062
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,520
least in the next 10 years

1063
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,200
so one thing that hong kong us need to

1064
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,079
uh think about is how do we decentralize

1065
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:54,560
our

1066
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,960
not just our protests but our also our

1067
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,920
daily life

1068
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,560
how do we decentralize our currency how

1069
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,960
do we decentralize uh

1070
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,839
accessibility to public goods um so that

1071
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:06,560
we can be

1072
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,920
more resilient against uh state control

1073
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,440
over our life

1074
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,240
now there might be one possibility in

1075
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,119
the future that

1076
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,440
chinese government were trying to set up

1077
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,280
concentration camp like they do

1078
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,880
in xinjiang in wigan regions now

1079
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,599
in hong kong and this is something that

1080
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,160
we

1081
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,000
need to push back as not just as

1082
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,280
in hong kong but also as international

1083
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,400
community because

1084
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,200
you know this is like crimes against

1085
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,800
humanity and

1086
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,000
china is definitely a leading

1087
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,520
authoritarian regime

1088
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,720
and if we don't pay enough uh attention

1089
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,359
on them

1090
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,200
they would just bully other countries

1091
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,520
like they do to check

1092
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,720
and also they were trying to normalize

1093
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,720
authoritarian practice

1094
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,119
to other countries so let's work

1095
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,319
together to deal with china

1096
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:15,839
okay johnson so thank you
