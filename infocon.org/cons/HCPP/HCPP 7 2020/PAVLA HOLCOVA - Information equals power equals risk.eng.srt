1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,359
okay i'm going to

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,280
talk today about a project that i

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,320
find extremely satisfying it's a

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,600
journalism project but it all started

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,439
with a tragedy

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
this is jan kuczyk he was my good friend

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,119
and a colleague

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,160
he was murdered 21st of february 2018

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,519
and because we didn't believe that um

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,520
the police would be able to discover who

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,120
did it and how it happened

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,360
we started our own investigation as well

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,399
uh okay

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,879
so what we did right after the murder

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,640
happened and the information became

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,200
public

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,320
what was couple of days later we

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,680
sent something we called emergency team

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,199
to collect as much of a data as possible

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,120
i was not able to attend i was living

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,800
under police protection because of the

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,440
story we

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,400
worked together and and which was the

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
main lead

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,720
at the beginning of who made me the one

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,000
who ordered the murder

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,439
the assassination but my colleagues went

29
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,479
and they have collected 24 terabytes of

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,840
data it's a lot

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
mostly it was cctv footage

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
from the small town when jano

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,960
used to live and they brought it back

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,759
home

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,680
and now we had 24 terabytes of a cctv

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,880
footage

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,240
that we actually knew that most probably

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,439
the perpetrators would be

39
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,479
somewhere there in 24 terabytes just

40
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,119
to compare if you know panama project

41
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,880
panama papers project

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,040
it had four terabytes so right from the

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,560
beginning we had

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,000
much more so

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,920
apart from cctv footage those were just

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
the small hints

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
that they were able to collect because

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,640
mostly the people who knew something

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,520
what happened and how were

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
living under police protection or

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,879
collapsed

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,520
like the the family sofiano and martina

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,959
jana kutsek was

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,640
murdered together with his fiancee

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
martina

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,280
so my colleagues brought home 24

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,000
terabytes of

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,120
data on about four or five

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
external hard drives so what we did a

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,680
little brainstorm what to do with it

61
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,560
unfortunately

62
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
we had or maybe unfortunately we had

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,160
already experienced

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,239
with investigation of assassination of

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,519
our colleague

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,280
the first colleague when we actually

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,879
developed the

68
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,200
the procedures and the skills how to do

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
it how to investigate it

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,920
was journalist from ukraine pavol

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,760
jeremet who was

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,440
killed by a car bomb so we just talked

73
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,760
and we we actually did copy paste of the

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,959
system

75
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,239
we did in his case

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,360
uh so what we did we

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
actually went back to welcome matcha

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,040
what is the town when yana was murdered

79
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,760
and we

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,720
where he used to live and we went

81
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,239
through all the streets

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,640
just taking pictures where uh what are

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,840
the positions of the cameras in the town

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,280
uh those are just couple of them

85
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,400
and you need to uh

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,319
give them numbers and actually a short

87
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,959
description where are those cameras

88
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
you can see on the right side that

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,680
there's football field

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
house mariana was murdered

91
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
another note that we took because

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
we considered those points super

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,280
important for

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,040
our own investigation but

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,480
it didn't really help so

96
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,319
what we did next was

97
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,279
that we created a map where actually we

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,839
knew

99
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
what are the positions of the camps but

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,279
we didn't know

101
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,919
what are the directions that the camps

102
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,560
are aiming

103
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,280
at so we went back and created

104
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,080
our own map with the locations of the

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,960
cameras

106
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
and where what what actually are they

107
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,400
shooting

108
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
this wouldn't be helpful either

109
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,320
because you don't really know what's

110
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,800
going on

111
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,560
so we went back and took

112
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,840
the photos what each of the cam

113
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,680
can see and the photos look like this

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,960
you know it's not really revealing or

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,080
special or saying anything

116
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,960
but we needed those pictures extremely

117
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,320
because what we needed to do

118
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,720
is to find those places this is how the

119
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,080
cctv footage

120
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,240
from those days looked like and if you

121
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
just receive this

122
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,320
24 terabytes of such a footage then you

123
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,840
have no idea what you are looking at

124
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,680
because at least me i've never been

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
there i don't know which cam

126
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,720
it is where is it positioned if it if

127
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
if this angle and this street would be

128
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,000
helpful or not

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,120
you are just watching and watching

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,280
so we've got the camera sorted we were

131
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,440
able to place them we were able to

132
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
to actually check only the cams that we

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
should be interested in

134
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,639
and that's what we that's how we started

135
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,320
but then you know those were

136
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,520
days and nights of cctv footage and we

137
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,800
didn't actually have

138
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,160
so much time to go through all of it

139
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,800
so we were trying

140
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,080
the new approach how to sort it because

141
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
we are not able you know

142
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,520
it's like you you are really watching

143
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
for hours empty street and then one car

144
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,960
is coming like here at the top of the

145
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,080
picture

146
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,600
and you can guess it's a black car okay

147
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
you can guess it's uh probably going

148
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,080
this direction

149
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,800
but that's it it's not when it's a it's

150
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,080
a personal car but

151
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,639
what to do with this kind of information

152
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,840
would you be able

153
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,960
to spot that this car was you know doing

154
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,479
something special could

155
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,919
this car be the one that the the

156
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,280
assassins throw to the house of yano

157
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,479
probably not so we

158
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,880
asked our colleague from kyrgyzstan who

159
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,000
offered his help in using artificial

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,960
intelligence

161
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,599
on sorting and taking out of the 24

162
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,960
terabytes of a footage

163
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,000
just you know the the the frames

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,199
where are the cars and actually

165
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,599
putting it in into special folder but

166
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,080
also

167
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
saying what time was it and which cam

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,680
was it

169
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
and you know couple of frames before and

170
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,919
a couple of frames after

171
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
so he created he started to build this

172
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,120
never

173
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,759
network that would actually be able to

174
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,400
spot

175
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,360
to to to save our time and and human

176
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,319
power

177
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,880
and to

178
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,440
create neural network that can recognize

179
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,400
the cars

180
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,680
and make a pictures of the cars where

181
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,240
hopefully we would be able to see the

182
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
license plates of the car

183
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,639
and where we will be able to see you

184
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,400
know what kind of a car it was

185
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,160
we got into a problem you know it was

186
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,720
not

187
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,120
the the the building of the neural

188
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,160
network

189
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,639
and the results it was not faster than

190
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,520
actually watching the footage yourself

191
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,360
so uh it didn't really help

192
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,560
because we were kind of in a hurry so we

193
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,440
were trying to find different approaches

194
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
but in the meantime the project

195
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,560
developed

196
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,840
also the investigation of the police

197
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
developed

198
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,479
uh six months after when we were

199
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,599
like you know trying to sort out at

200
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,559
least the days

201
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,000
and hours around the assassination

202
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,479
there was no police progress at least

203
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,360
not official

204
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,480
not public no one knew if there is still

205
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:46,880
the

206
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,200
investigation police investigation into

207
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,320
the murder

208
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,000
if there is anything new uh

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,560
i didn't trust the police because they

210
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,839
uh

211
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,440
took me twice for

212
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
i thought it's gonna be witness

213
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
testimony but it was

214
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,360
rather interrogation during the the

215
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,200
first interrogation

216
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,240
they asked me

217
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,760
things that they can google in five

218
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,080
minutes uh

219
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,560
how tall was hyanna could see you know

220
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,120
how

221
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
how long did they knew miss martina each

222
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,880
other if i've ever met her

223
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,839
if i know him they didn't ask a single

224
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,399
question

225
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,279
about the work we've done together what

226
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,399
was kind of weird

227
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,519
you know by then i was living under

228
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,240
police protection what meant that for

229
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
the interrogation i was put into the

230
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,680
helicopter in a bulletproof vest

231
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,800
four other people with me heavily

232
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,399
armed uh they put a helmet on my head

233
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,480
and we flew actually by helicopter from

234
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,839
prague to bratislava

235
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,640
but it's about 300 kilometers and then i

236
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,399
went to the interrogation and they asked

237
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,600
me those questions that

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,880
they can actually find on google

239
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,440
so then we made the whole circus back

240
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,279
again they put me into the helicopter

241
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,959
and flew me back to prague and i was

242
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:07,839
like

243
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,680
what was it so they didn't gain my trust

244
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,000
but next time they said okay now we

245
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,720
actually got

246
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,360
into some of the leads and we need you

247
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
back for

248
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,760
witness testimony could you come again

249
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,800
to bratislava

250
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
so i was still by then living under

251
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,320
police protection

252
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,440
this time we went by cars what is kind

253
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,640
of a tricky

254
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,680
because i needed to be handed over at

255
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,720
the borders

256
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
i'm a czech citizen i'm living in czech

257
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,279
republic i was going to give

258
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,839
witness testimony in slovakia so again

259
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,920
you know

260
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
it was quite complicated any they needed

261
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,079
to close all the street when i was going

262
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,920
out of the car and then

263
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,000
but this time there were three guys

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,560
uh three investigators who were asking

265
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
me questions for seven hours and at the

266
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,399
end of the interrogation

267
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,519
they took my phone saying that it made

268
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,920
contain information that i was involved

269
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,000
in the assassination of jano

270
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,279
what i later found out that yes

271
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,040
that the police by then had 32 leads

272
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,079
of possible motives of the assassination

273
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,560
on a scale of 1 to 32 from the most

274
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,360
probable

275
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,600
to the least probable and i was number 8

276
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,640
so only later i've learned that it was

277
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,320
not some kind of a joke when they took

278
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,920
my phone but they really believed that i

279
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
killed thiano

280
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,600
as i said there was no visible progress

281
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,480
within those

282
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,079
six months so

283
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,200
we didn't know if if you know if they

284
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
are investigating at all

285
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,040
and what was the third critical point

286
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
when we

287
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,000
decided that there is no reason to trust

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,160
the police investigation

289
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,760
it was actually the fact that they

290
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
did a lot of really big mistakes

291
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,160
directly at the crime scene

292
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,079
you know when they were discovered

293
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,160
when when the body sofiano and martina

294
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,519
were discovered

295
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,920
uh the police that came to the place

296
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,800
believed

297
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
that uh it may be a gas leak

298
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,000
so they opened the windows then

299
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
the emergency unit came and they just

300
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,320
didn't know what happened so they moved

301
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,160
the bodies to see if those people

302
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,440
are shut down or what actually happened

303
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,079
so when actually the proper

304
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,720
investigators came to the police

305
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,680
to the crime scene

306
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,959
it was not how it should be it was not

307
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,000
like it was left

308
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,519
by the perpetrators uh

309
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,760
also they set the the time of the

310
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,040
assassination

311
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,880
about three days wrong so really we were

312
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,600
just like

313
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,720
what the hell is going on

314
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,800
nevertheless the police really

315
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,600
progressed

316
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,240
and after nine months after the

317
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,839
assassination

318
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,680
they were able to

319
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,800
find and arrest those guys who pulled

320
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,760
the trigger

321
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,839
and the guy who organized the murder

322
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,279
all of those guys are in jail they were

323
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,720
sentenced

324
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,839
and yeah they are serving their terms

325
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,200
in a prison now so

326
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
it was positive surprising uh

327
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,760
great and we were relieved but we didn't

328
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,160
get

329
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,880
the police didn't get and started at the

330
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,199
top

331
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,440
of those three guys to investigate who

332
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,839
ordered the assassination

333
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,000
even though the information were not

334
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,320
public after one year we were able

335
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,440
to actually reconstruct how

336
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,160
the assassination happened we've

337
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,839
published it on occ

338
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,880
occrp website with my colleague we

339
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,120
actually spent

340
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
about a month only

341
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,519
talking to the families talking to

342
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,920
to the witnesses talking to the sources

343
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,800
being in

344
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,760
belka machado town maniano lived going

345
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,160
through

346
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,959
emails and so on and we were able to

347
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,000
reconstruct

348
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,440
what happened that night uh

349
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,639
but we didn't stop there let me just

350
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:32,959
check

351
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,000
how much time we have

352
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,880
okay so

353
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,839
that's what we've done after 12 months

354
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,639
and eight months after we just got a

355
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,440
source

356
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,519
who had given us 70 terabytes of

357
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,920
data

358
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,079
it was complete

359
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,120
file police investigation file

360
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,000
including all the annexes so we were

361
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,519
actually now

362
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,800
uh handling 70 terabytes of data

363
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,760
what was like absolute overkill you know

364
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,320
when i

365
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,639
called my boss that we would need some

366
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,600
technical help

367
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,720
with this data he said yeah

368
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,440
17 that's a lot that's a lot i said no

369
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,959
it's 70. you know

370
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,360
we would need to buy a special servers

371
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,880
how to how to

372
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,480
deal with it and so on uh that's how it

373
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
looked like when we

374
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,279
when we actually started to move the

375
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,880
data

376
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,759
and now about the data and the project

377
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,519
uh this is how it looked at the end

378
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,639
after sorting

379
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,279
all the data

380
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,160
what is important to say when you get 70

381
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,880
terabytes of

382
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,240
data it's heavy you know

383
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,759
you you can actually move

384
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,199
it's easier to move a human being from

385
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,639
place a to place b than 70 terabytes of

386
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,360
data

387
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,560
i was carrying it from zizkov in prague

388
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
to our office that is downtown

389
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,199
and it had like 15 kilograms it's like

390
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,000
we didn't expect it we didn't include it

391
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
in our calculations when we actually

392
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,160
asked the guy from berlin to help to

393
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,199
come and help us

394
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,120
with the technical solution that we

395
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
would need to carry it

396
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,959
in our backpacks and of course

397
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,519
copying 70 terabytes of data takes a lot

398
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,800
of time

399
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,240
we are talking about days not hours

400
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,360
even if you are creative and

401
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,800
and use raspberry pi

402
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,480
on multiple levels so you can copy more

403
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,279
disks at the same time it was a lot

404
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,000
uh then we needed to find out what to do

405
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
with the data

406
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
because 70 terabytes of data it's not in

407
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,480
human power

408
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,679
to go through it and of course

409
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,199
we were pushed by the time so

410
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,880
we ask another member of our tech team

411
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
if she can help us to sort it out and

412
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,559
she said

413
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,039
yes so because it was police

414
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,319
investigation we've got

415
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,039
full images of the computers of cell

416
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,839
phones

417
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,919
we've got a lot of cctv footage once

418
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,919
again we've got a

419
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,799
bts towers information we've got

420
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,919
all kinds of data

421
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,559
because those were full images of the

422
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,080
computers and cell phones

423
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,360
or any external hard drive they were

424
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,559
empty spaces left so we agreed that we

425
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,000
can delete

426
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,039
two things the empty space

427
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,200
that we don't need you know the the full

428
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,080
image

429
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,960
of the device including the empty space

430
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,520
and there was a lot of hungary and porn

431
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,320
for some reason from some computers of

432
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,760
those perpetrators

433
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
so we agree that we can delete it as

434
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,880
well

435
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,840
at the end we have 55.3 terabytes of

436
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
data

437
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,840
cctv was about 27 terabytes

438
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,200
and then images of hard drives

439
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,039
usb laptops computers

440
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,559
all sorts of data all sorts of formats

441
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,440
but it was kind of more positive to see

442
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,240
it this way

443
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,039
than what we've seen uh when we first

444
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,760
checked

445
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,840
the the the analysis of the police

446
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,679
investigation

447
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,440
and then my role started

448
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,000
unfortunately today i was hoping ar

449
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,039
pacheltes

450
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,120
a journalist and writer from slovakia

451
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,160
could come as well

452
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,520
he couldn't he's in france

453
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
we've got this 70 terabytes of data with

454
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,640
my colleague from slovakia and we

455
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,720
had quite a debate what to do with the

456
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,919
data

457
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,039
because even if we would

458
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,320
you know be the journalist be the you

459
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,880
know

460
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,679
the the proud journalist who who wants

461
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,160
to

462
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,360
have exclusivity on this data and reveal

463
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,400
new things from the data

464
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,520
we knew that it's not in our power to

465
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,600
actually spend another seven years just

466
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,280
going through the data

467
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,559
so we have come with idea

468
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,600
that actually we need to kill

469
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,360
our egos and give the information to the

470
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,320
others

471
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,480
we will just get it ready we will just

472
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,520
process it

473
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,679
we will provide all the service needed

474
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,520
but we will give it to all journalists

475
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,720
in slovakia

476
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,559
who we trust so we have created a team

477
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,000
of about 14 journalists from all major

478
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,160
slovak media including tv station

479
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
including tabloid

480
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,039
but later proof really smart

481
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,400
and we give them access we were

482
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,559
really careful about how to do it

483
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,840
because of security

484
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,640
because the data that were included in

485
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,760
this

486
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,360
data set was super sensitive

487
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,559
and the government

488
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,679
by then probably understood that uh

489
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,520
if we will reveal what's in the data

490
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,679
before elections

491
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,720
they would probably fail so there are a

492
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,280
lot of

493
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,760
ways that we're trying to stop us

494
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,600
from revealing from working on the data

495
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,799
and revealing it

496
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,080
so for security reasons we created one

497
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,039
access room in bratislava and gave

498
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,039
access to accredited journalists from

499
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,559
slovak media

500
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,159
and we agreed with arpa that

501
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,640
you know to to create better

502
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,679
collaboration

503
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,400
environment we are not going to publish

504
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,360
any story

505
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,840
from the data we'll just give it to the

506
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,880
others

507
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,280
so we created this access room where

508
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,240
they have

509
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,080
access computers to access the data and

510
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,480
but not to carry it away if they wanted

511
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,600
to download something and carry it away

512
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
they would use encrypted usbs where they

513
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,919
can download the data and open it at

514
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,000
home computer but in case they would

515
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,720
lose the the usb nothing will happen

516
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
uh and we need this to create our own

517
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,280
tools as well

518
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,720
uh one of the main finding

519
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,240
in the data was a

520
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,559
cell phone of marianne kochner marianne

521
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,440
kochner

522
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,000
according to my opinion not according to

523
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,799
the opinion

524
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,159
of the of the judges uh

525
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,320
was the one who ordered the murder

526
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,240
he had three my application for

527
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,919
encrypted communication

528
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,080
but for some reason well i know the

529
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,960
reason

530
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,880
but uh you know the police but also

531
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,080
then also us we were able to decrypt the

532
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,840
communication

533
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,919
uh it was because marianne kochner

534
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,720
sent a message from the jail that his

535
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,799
phone should be deleted

536
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,280
and those are the access data those are

537
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,320
the access codes

538
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,799
he wrote it on a paper and just send it

539
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,760
out

540
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,520
and the guy who was supposed to

541
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,960
you know securely erase the cell phone

542
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,240
he gave it

543
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,360
to the police including the access data

544
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,280
uh but there were over sixty thousand of

545
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,520
the messages on a three mile alone

546
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,919
so we needed to create very simple tool

547
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,280
how to read it

548
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,400
because uh we wanted to read

549
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,640
the conversations not you know the

550
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,440
timestamps and how it went

551
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,039
and we also created almost offline

552
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,000
map when we were able to spot where the

553
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,880
where the

554
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,159
the phone was moving and this really

555
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:10,720
helped

556
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,880
with our work that started

557
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,919
5th january 2020 we started to publish

558
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,760
first stories

559
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,520
uh what we created was is still probably

560
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
the best investigative journalism team

561
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,559
in slovakia

562
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,520
now it has about 12 people still they

563
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,240
are doing

564
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
great job publishing stories we have

565
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,480
published about

566
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,640
i don't know maybe 60 stories so far

567
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,960
uh the ruling party

568
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,360
went they didn't one after probably

569
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,960
15 years they lose the the elections

570
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,880
uh 13 judges were arrested

571
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,000
uh other judges at the top of it like

572
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,840
constitutional judge

573
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,000
where you know we're

574
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,440
forced by the tension and the

575
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,640
by the public pressure we created to to

576
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,120
resign the police president had to

577
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,799
resign

578
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,840
other police officers high ranking had

579
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,600
to resign as well

580
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,640
uh unfortunately marianne kochner and

581
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,720
the lady who was helping him to

582
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,240
to organize the murder they were

583
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,320
set free uh they can't be because they

584
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,720
have

585
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,760
other crimes uh they committed other

586
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,799
crimes as well

587
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,279
but they were absolved of the murder uh

588
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,240
i think months ago yeah pretty much

589
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,440
months ago

590
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,880
but we appealed and we are just you know

591
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,000
uh still working on the data

592
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,919
to show the judges that actually those

593
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,000
guys are really guilty

594
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,840
okay i'm done

595
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:15,840
any questions

596
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,080
yeah thanks for excellent work and uh

597
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,520
question why you just don't

598
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,720
publish data in the full like

599
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,600
make it public i mean really public put

600
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,320
it in a

601
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,279
in a you know server which is not hosted

602
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,000
here or

603
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
whatever there are ways to make it

604
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
really worldwide yeah

605
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,159
first of all publishing 70 terabytes

606
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,000
would be really expensive

607
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
we don't have we have manpower we don't

608
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,760
have the server power

609
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,840
and wha what what's more uh

610
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,960
there are really private inves private

611
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,679
things uh that we don't want to be

612
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,640
published of

613
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,760
random bystanders so

614
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,240
we didn't want to release this kind of

615
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,279
information

616
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,279
you know the the the three my

617
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,320
conversation

618
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,720
it was leaked to the public everyone can

619
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,400
read it who can read slovak

620
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,760
but there were other about

621
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,360
health conditions and so on of people

622
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,720
who were really just

623
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,840
random bystanders in all the case so we

624
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,640
decided

625
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,240
to to to put it into the context

626
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,120
and publish as a journalistic work

627
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,720
okay any other uh i have a question so

628
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,520
firstly this

629
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,559
this was the most brave presentation we

630
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,520
have

631
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,279
now so so uh my question is

632
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,799
um because it's it's because

633
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,400
you basically destroyed probably carry

634
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,320
of many people a lot of politicians a

635
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,960
lot of like reputation of many people

636
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,679
uh probably people are interested in the

637
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,960
fact

638
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,039
if these people ever

639
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,240
threaten you in some way yeah

640
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,440
yeah yeah and also how did you cope

641
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,360
with with this situation um

642
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,840
yeah i when i was coming here

643
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,360
i was you know just thinking about the

644
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,480
threats

645
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,600
and uh yes of course we are quite often

646
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,760
present in in the public discourses of

647
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,799
politicians

648
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,080
prime minister told about me that i'm

649
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,760
head of a conspiration that

650
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
just wants to overthrow the government

651
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,200
that i am

652
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,120
public enemy and doesn't really

653
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,679
matter i didn't really care because um

654
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,039
i don't i don't really care what what he

655
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,320
says about me

656
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,960
but i have actually to

657
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,840
[Music]

658
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,039
two stories when i am kind of a story

659
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,360
of those who are sending the threats the

660
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,919
first one was when i received the first

661
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,000
threat after publishing uh article on

662
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,080
on a real mafia on a real balkan

663
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,039
organized crime

664
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,919
i have received a letter that was

665
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,520
actually saying

666
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,480
we know where you live uh we hate you we

667
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
are going to do harm to you and so on

668
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,960
but i sent a letter to a wrong address i

669
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,559
moved about a year

670
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,399
before the the letter was sent

671
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,799
and it just came to the wrong address so

672
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,880
it took another three months before i've

673
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
learned that i have a problem

674
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,840
and actually this is happening right now

675
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,600
we've published another

676
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,960
hardcore mafia stories uh on another

677
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,000
balkan criminal organization and we know

678
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,480
that

679
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,799
they've sent us a letter but we can't

680
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,640
pick it up from the post office

681
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,120
so most probably if there is any threat

682
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,559
or if there is any

683
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,480
bullet or if there is any poison or

684
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,200
whatever it would be just

685
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,120
returned to the center so sorry

686
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,720
we tried guys hello

687
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,039
uh it's been really uh interesting to

688
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,120
hear your investigation work and i was

689
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,240
just wondering if you

690
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,200
are aware of um what is happening right

691
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,480
now behind the scenes

692
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,200
about taking down the deep state and the

693
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,399
cabal

694
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,880
by all the messages that are placed on

695
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,520
the queue

696
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,640
the q and on posts and all the links and

697
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,399
all this code work which is actually

698
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,399
playing out right now and probably also

699
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,240
some mass arrests from some bad actors

700
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,679
in the political world

701
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,960
on a global scale actually so to me this

702
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,240
is very exciting times

703
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,360
because i really like that these deep

704
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,399
staters are step by step exposed by

705
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,240
the messaging board of the queue group

706
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,200
uh yes i'm aware of it but of course i

707
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,799
would like to know more

708
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,760
i am not really an expert on this some

709
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,520
of my colleagues are really

710
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,720
especially in romania they are into it

711
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,000
but i am really not not

712
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,760
my mental capacity is not really uh

713
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,880
ready to dive deep into this topic it's

714
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,919
really amazing

715
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,600
you should check it out sure

716
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,039
i'm afraid i hate to burst your bubble

717
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,840
but i've been

718
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,760
paying attention to the q anon phenomena

719
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,080
since it came out a number of years ago

720
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,520
and i've come to the conclusion that

721
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,360
it's actually an operation

722
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,480
by us intelligence to distract from

723
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,159
otherwise legitimate efforts to take

724
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:44,559
down

725
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,600
the deep state because it specifically

726
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,080
seems to focus everyone's attention

727
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,159
in areas where the deeps where it's

728
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,240
actually to the american deep state's

729
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,960
advantage

730
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,799
to have people's attention focused and

731
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,880
it focuses their attention away

732
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,600
from areas where people are actively

733
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,559
doing things against

734
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,440
against the deep state for example we

735
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:05,919
saw

736
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,240
recently the trial of julian assange in

737
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,679
london the extradition trial was

738
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,559
happening

739
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,960
and while the trial was ongoing the q

740
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,240
and on messaging

741
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,640
was not telling people to support julian

742
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,159
assange and prevent him from being

743
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:18,960
extradited

744
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,279
but specifically in german chat groups

745
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,360
the q on messaging was that

746
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,679
extradition is good assange needs to go

747
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,120
to the u.s because quote

748
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,919
quote unquote he will be safe there

749
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:30,640
which

750
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,320
is exactly what the american deep state

751
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,000
wants people to think

752
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,399
and we've seen similar things earlier in

753
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,080
the q anon phenomena

754
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,760
where kunan was saying that

755
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,919
julian assange is no longer in charge of

756
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,679
wikileaks therefore people shouldn't

757
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,000
trust

758
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,640
wikileaks

759
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,919
but that of course isn't accurate we

760
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,559
know assange was in london is in london

761
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,519
uh was is on trial uh was on trial and

762
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,679
was in fact in control of wikileaks

763
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,840
because he used the bitcoin blockchain

764
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,720
to prove uh his ownership and control of

765
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,159
the wikileaks donation address

766
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,840
which is actually a very interesting use

767
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,320
of bitcoin technology

768
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,679
to do identity verification

769
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,320
so again i would strongly advise caution

770
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,240
where q1 is concerned because

771
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,480
it does appear there's a lot of evidence

772
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,720
that something seriously wrong there

773
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,279
my question for you is totally unrelated

774
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,519
to q

775
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,440
uh is anon bit more technical because i

776
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,360
think you talked a lot about what you've

777
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,840
done

778
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,360
i'm wondering if you can talk at all

779
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,960
about either the technical security

780
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,320
measures you used

781
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,600
maybe you didn't need any because the

782
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,279
mobsters are very incompetent with

783
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:39,919
setting the

784
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,440
letter to the wrong address no we're

785
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,120
talking about we we

786
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,399
really um

787
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,559
we had a good security people it's not

788
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,440
that

789
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,679
i would be expert on it but

790
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,039
um uh

791
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,240
the what was our biggest concern

792
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,519
well i don't know where are the servers

793
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,760
with access to the data we call the

794
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,600
project fatcat

795
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,320
uh so if i'm going to talk about fat cat

796
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,440
those are the

797
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,159
the the the data on the server somewhere

798
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,360
i don't know where and we get

799
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,720
access in the secure room through

800
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,240
uh linux based laptop stations that were

801
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,039
actually

802
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,919
striped of all any other devices the

803
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,080
only thing you can actually do there

804
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,080
is to get remote access to the data

805
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,480
nothing else you can't download anything

806
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,200
on usb

807
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,279
you can't get uh online apart

808
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,480
to to to this data uh

809
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,840
it was hell uh usually the the system

810
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,559
failed

811
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,519
when it didn't you know when there was

812
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,080
no reason

813
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,240
we also had a one train guy always that

814
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,799
we called

815
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,519
librarian who was there assisting the

816
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,519
journalist in searching the data or if

817
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,080
the system

818
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,839
failed to to fix it

819
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,040
to reboot it but

820
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,000
that's how we did it of course we use

821
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,280
encryption we use

822
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,639
veracrypt for the data what is

823
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,879
but what is impossible if you want to to

824
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,879
use veracrypt on 70 terabytes of the

825
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:25,359
data

826
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,480
it slows really slows down the process

827
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
so actually what happened is that

828
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,079
someone took the data

829
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,079
the the external hard drives

830
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,079
somewhere and i didn't know where and

831
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,560
just one person knows

832
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,879
where the data are now based and it's

833
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,279
not me

834
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,879
and this guy he's quite experienced in

835
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,159
in security and privacy so i

836
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,560
have to trust him can you talk anything

837
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,199
about

838
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,920
um measures you either used or if you

839
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,359
can't talk about what you've used

840
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,359
what you would recommend others use yes

841
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,720
protect your own privacy

842
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,280
security against these very powerful

843
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,320
versions yeah we

844
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,640
we have uh our procedures at occrp

845
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,680
we have the things we have to follow

846
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,720
uh if you don't follow them uh you can't

847
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,839
actually

848
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,520
work for occrp but it must be balanced

849
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,280
because we also work with journalists

850
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,760
from

851
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,040
uh countries like sudan or

852
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,640

thank you uh you mentioned that you

867
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,720
provided the data to the tabloids

868
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,040
and you wanted one template and you said

869
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,720
it was a good decision so

870
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,920
i would like to ask why okay

871
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,040
there was a this case that's really

872
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,760
disgusting

873
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,160
in slovakia when actually um

874
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,240
the the there is there was a rehab

875
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,359
for drug addicted youngsters but you

876
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,000
can't really in slovakia drug addicted

877
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,400
youngster is anyone who actually had one

878
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,720
joint

879
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,160
and they were actually bringing to this

880
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,880
rehab

881
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,200
young people boys and girls under 15

882
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,480
years old

883
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,119
and those boys and girls were sexually

884
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:01,920
abused

885
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,760
there we have strong suspicion

886
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,359
that a also politicians

887
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,119
from the ruling party were actually

888
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,440
using this rehab

889
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,520
as a kind of a source for good sex

890
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,760
of underage kids and

891
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,359
you know when when the scandal broke

892
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,359
when finally someone was able to to

893
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,200
escape and tell the story was going on

894
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,760
there

895
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,040
uh those were two girls one was called

896
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,359
junkie don't trust her so nothing really

897
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,200
happened but the

898
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,240
uh the rehab lost the license

899
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,960
to operate so they were not able to you

900
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,079
know

901
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,920
uh run the kids as usual

902
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,240
so within this data we found out

903
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,280
that actually the same guys opened a new

904
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,160
rehab

905
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,079
in different place in slovakia and they

906
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,599
are still doing it and they are still

907
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,560
running it

908
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,920
so we send

909
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,480
a paparazzi to to stay there and

910
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,240
actually took pictures of the guys who

911
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,880
were running

912
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,599
the rehab the new one that those are the

913
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,960
same old guys

914
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,640
and he was able to stay there he knew

915
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,800
exactly what to do he took the pictures

916
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,839
and we published the story

917
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,800
[Music]

918
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,560
