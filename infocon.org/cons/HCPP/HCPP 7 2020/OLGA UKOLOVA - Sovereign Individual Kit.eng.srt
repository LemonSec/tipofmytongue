1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,520
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,120
uh my name is olga

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,840
and uh yes today i will be presenting

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,000
one of my concepts

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,880
i've been working on it for the past

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,800
couple of months i don't remember how

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,680
many how much

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,359
how many exactly but uh

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,000
yeah if you have any questions or if you

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,439
eventually would want to

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,119
collaborate on something drop me a

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,840
message

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,320
um i'm going to start with introducing

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,800
myself

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,000
as normal people usually do

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,680
as i said my name is olga and my

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,160
middle name i mean currently we live in

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,200
a world where

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,399
everyone should identify as something or

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,920
someone my second name is dolores

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,399
and i will probably tell a few words

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,000
about why that's my

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,079
second name has can you raise your hand

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,079
if you did not watch the west world

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,480
series

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
one really

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,360
okay online guys

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,560
if you have not watched it spoiler alert

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,439
so the west world is a very good series

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,560
if you ask me

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,520
uh it's about a world where there are

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,159
two

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,360
types of people of

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,799
uh first type is uh actual people

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,960
that arrive at a westworld park

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,840
full of different entertainments and

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,119
everything like that

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,960
and they fulfill mostly

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,600
every every single desire of theirs from

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,159
uh

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,880
raping people to killing people to

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,000
building houses

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
and whatever and then the second group

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,040
of

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,240
beans is hosts

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
the hosts are actually ai's

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,439
i do not like to use that

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,840
word but whatever now it will work

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,119
ais that looks very very similar to

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,399
regular people

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,040
and so similar that very often you

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,720
cannot even

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,440
recognize the the ai and the robot

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,239
behind

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,879
the host dolores is uh

56
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,080
one of the oldest hosts and she was the

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,120
first one

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,959
and throughout the whole series she was

59
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,239
operating uh

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,840
sorry for taking this along but um

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
as you probably remember she started

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
as a very humble very warming

63
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,920
very polite damsel which never protested

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,560
never

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,440
raised any questions and always complied

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
with whatever she was told to do or

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,560
to think and her personal motto

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,519
at the beginning is some people just

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,080
choose to see the ugliness in this world

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,560
and the disarray i choose to see the

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,560
beauty

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
but that did not last long

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,959
because starting from i guess

74
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,599
uh second part of uh second

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,840
yeah second season dolores

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,120
becomes something else first she becomes

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,920
the first self-aware host

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,280
the person who asks questions and

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,879
who finally understands her own will

80
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,000
finds the path to it and follows it she

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,519
becomes the first host

82
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,920
who incorporates into the real human

83
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,200
world

84
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,000
and her personal motto always also

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,720
changes

86
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640
just a tiny bit from that point

87
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,799
she starts to follow two basic concepts

88
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
the first one is when you've been

89
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,319
in the darkness long enough you begin to

90
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,519
see

91
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,120
and it's pretty true for her because she

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,159
spent

93
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,599
probably most of her time on trying to

94
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,200
find her own will

95
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,959
again among all the networks and all the

96
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,000
algorithms that

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,798
were built inside of her and the second

98
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,358
part

99
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,478
is that we each gave the other beautiful

100
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,440
gift

101
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
a choice we are the authors of our

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
stories now

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,040
can you even imagine an a.i a

104
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,759
bunch of patterns saying something like

105
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,120
that

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
if you meet some something like this in

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
real life you'll probably be a bit

108
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
afraid but that's not the best part

109
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
still

110
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,080
the best part comes next because when

111
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,160
dolores comes out from the

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,880
imaginary imaginary world to the real

113
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,000
one

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
she finds the enemy of hers

115
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,240
and the enemy is also an ai

116
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,840
and the name of that ai

117
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,400
sounds pretty similar to some

118
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,240
christian entities that

119
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,759
probably some of us some of you follow

120
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
and admire she understood that

121
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,000
that ai is actually something that

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,199
wants to destroy those who have their

123
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,639
own will

124
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,080
and eventually he

125
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,560
fails to do that because she gets to him

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,759
first

127
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,600
and sometimes this being

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,199
the ai is referenced to as common good

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,320
sometimes as a god sometimes

130
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,680
as collective benefits but

131
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,000
all of all of those are still the same

132
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,000
concepts

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,080
yep so from that

134
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,840
i'm going to start

135
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
the presentation so the concept

136
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,600
is pretty huge and i will not fit it

137
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,440
into 45 minutes

138
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,199
uh is the concept is also very new

139
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,039
at least i haven't found a lot of

140
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,639
information on it

141
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,080
uh i will start today with philosophical

142
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
background and with a

143
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,280
basic criterion parameters that you need

144
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
to understand before moving to

145
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,319
technological and other types of details

146
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,800
so sovereign individual kit if you ask

147
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,160
me

148
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,840
contains uh

149
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,360
one two three four five six uh six

150
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
faces first it should have a system of

151
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,600
values

152
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,720
then uh it

153
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,960
should have it requires a bit of

154
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,080
knowledge

155
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,039
also it requires resources tools allies

156
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,520
and privacy

157
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,360
let's start from the left

158
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,319
first concept first part of the concept

159
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:02,880
is

160
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,880
intrinsic system of values

161
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,520
why i mean everyone knows what

162
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,720
sovereignty is

163
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,120
probably as they say everyone thinks

164
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
that they know what's

165
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,479
good for them everyone thinks that

166
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,479
they're pretty much educated

167
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,400
probably i'm gonna show you that that's

168
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
not really true

169
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,639
and this soft sovereign individual kit

170
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,479
from a philosophical background

171
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,840
background of course

172
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,680
also has a story behind it and

173
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,199
a story is creating a story

174
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,919
it's a skill that evolutionary helped us

175
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,039
a species

176
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,840
become something more than just an

177
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,800
animal

178
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
this is why we now can create art create

179
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,080
music

180
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,280
this is why we can engineer things

181
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,400
this is why we can think this is why we

182
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,879
can build

183
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,240
and out of that out of just

184
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,960
a skill to create a story the philosophy

185
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,919
was born

186
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,919
not the philosophy of modern times but

187
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,360
the ancient one

188
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,319
the philosophy which is the study of

189
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,800
general and fundamental questions

190
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,400
about many different things about

191
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
existence knowledge

192
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,960
values reason mind and language usually

193
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,120
the questions that are raised

194
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,400
then not try to be analyzed and to

195
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,879
approached by philosophy and

196
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,400
philosophical method

197
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,560
i want to point out also that philosophy

198
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,759
is not

199
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,760
is very different from ethics and is

200
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
very different from moral

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,719
and i'll go back to that a bit later

202
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,279
also i want to emphasize that philosophy

203
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,800
and philosophical method are

204
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
totally different things philosophical

205
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,320
method is a method

206
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,760
for a person to

207
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,000
explore something to describe something

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
and to learn something

209
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,200
philosophical method from this

210
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
perspective

211
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,920
crea has a couple of steps first

212
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,560
you doubt the existing parameters dogmas

213
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
ideas whatever

214
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
then you formulate questions and

215
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,720
problems then you enunciate a solution

216
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,000
justify it and receive critics boom

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
profit uh it seems very good

218
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,080
and it does work as a it is a good

219
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,000
method for some cases but it's a very

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,600
bad method for other because a it's very

221
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,000
hard

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,519
to verify or to prove and b

223
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,760
using philosophical method every now and

224
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,279
then can actually

225
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,600
give you the state of paralysis

226
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,839
so-called paralysis by analysis

227
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,720
where you just keep creating theory

228
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,880
after theory without even having

229
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
anything that would prove it and

230
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,320
anything that would

231
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,839
somehow even try to break it

232
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,839
also if we talk about philosophy

233
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,200
philosophical method

234
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,880
it's very important to at some point

235
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,320
ask a question where do you actually

236
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,760
draw the line

237
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,760
between affection and idea

238
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,360
between something that was just

239
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
a legacy misconception cargo cults or

240
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
something like that

241
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,399
and a really really valuable experience

242
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,160
this is probably the character that

243
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,839
everyone knows about and

244
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,200
a lot of people can say that she was mad

245
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
that alice made nonsense she said

246
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,040
nonsense

247
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,640
and all of her deeds all of her actions

248
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,680
were pretty much insane

249
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,800
a i can disagree on that and b

250
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,240
she is a perfect example of using the

251
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,200
philosophical method

252
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,440
uh in order to coming back

253
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
coming back a bit in order to establish

254
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,880
a system of values we need to first

255
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,000
talk a bit about the basic terms

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
that everyone is using now because

257
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,760
sovereignty is the new hype

258
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
as privacy was before it as freedom was

259
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,120
before it

260
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,760
as whatever was before it and it's

261
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,920
pretty

262
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,440
important to clarify

263
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,560
answers to three basic questions who is

264
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,760
an individual

265
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,120
what is freedom and what is sovereignty

266
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
let's start the first question is who is

267
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,640
an individual

268
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,920
according to many people that are asked

269
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,880
an individual is every living being on

270
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,800
the planet not human

271
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,320
every living being including plants

272
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,360
including animals

273
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,000
i mean come on

274
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,279
my interpretation of what an

275
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,800
individual is who it is is

276
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,160
like this individual is something

277
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,160
or someone if we talk about ai

278
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,279
that has these parameters first

279
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,480
is individual which means it's

280
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,680
non-divisible

281
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,079
it's like one person cannot have half of

282
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,760
the person right you cannot have half of

283
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,560
the individual

284
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,360
it's one whole and it's some someone

285
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,760
that

286
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,120
stands outside the crowd it's one

287
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
single being second

288
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,880
uh individual always needs to have a

289
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,680
well-formed

290
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,880
understanding and perception of himself

291
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,440
and the world that surrounds him and

292
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,160
lastly

293
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,800
which is probably most important thing

294
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,320
he always makes the

295
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,279
decisions according to individualistic

296
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,040
decision-making system

297
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,160
not the group one not the collectivist

298
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,399
one

299
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,800
next what is freedom

300
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,560
same pattern asking people around

301
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,839
i got these concepts and these

302
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,040
definitions so freedom is

303
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,440
when you can choose the master to serve

304
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,279
freedom is when you can manifest social

305
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,079
justice

306
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,519
for sure freedom is uh to be warmly

307
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,760
welcomed by your community and supported

308
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,839
to be supported by by the government

309
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,200
and of course freedom being free also

310
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,560
means to be

311
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,399
free from viruses and everything that

312
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,399
our health care system helps us with

313
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,000
but looking at all of those parameters

314
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,560
you

315
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,680
kind of might have

316
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,800
a bit of doubt

317
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,320
and probably you have these doubts the

318
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
expectations of what freedom is

319
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,839
according to those people

320
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,480
seem pretty like normal for the average

321
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,839
person

322
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,800
but they never think about what those

323
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,639
things actually mean and how they are

324
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,600
being implemented in real life if we

325
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
take

326
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,440
the first parameter when you can choose

327
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,800
the master freedom is when you can

328
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
choose the master to serve

329
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,120
what in reality it means is just to

330
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,000
choose between

331
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,440
50 shades of shackles that might be put

332
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,120
on you

333
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,920
if you talk about being warmly welcomed

334
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,000
by your community

335
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,079
probably you might remember what social

336
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,199
stigma is

337
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,839
for example like best example a social

338
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,720
stigma is the

339
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
abortion topic it can be

340
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,120
legal in some countries but it's

341
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
so not it's so socially unacceptable

342
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,639
that even if you do that you're out

343
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,199
just like that

344
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,079
and for sure the current

345
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,880
the current two very important pains is

346
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,639
the support by the government and health

347
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,199
care

348
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,240
systems supporting bills

349
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,600
that are just given to any businesses

350
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,639
right now

351
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
as again probably a shackle

352
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,959
or a mask to just shut the business up

353
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,360
stop it from crying all over the

354
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,079
newspapers that the business is dying

355
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,440
and

356
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
at some point if we talk about the

357
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,560
health care

358
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,800
we also can see the paralysis of many

359
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,600
people because

360
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,880
they understand that one positive result

361
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,600
of test

362
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,079
which can be false positive can actually

363
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:32,880
lead to them

364
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,800
losing pretty much everything that they

365
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,040
own

366
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,360
so what is freedom

367
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,720
freedom is actually to be your own

368
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,079
master freedom means to understand what

369
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,759
you want every single moment

370
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,160
and to be able to act on that desire

371
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,000
without willing to compromise on

372
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,959
any details and without asking for

373
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,839
permission

374
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,240
and very important to notice here asking

375
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,360
for permission

376
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,839
and collaborating with other individuals

377
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,920
are totally different things

378
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,199
i will talk about this a bit later so

379
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,759
to sum up freedom does not mean to be

380
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,519
free in choosing your masters

381
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,680
freedom means to be strong and conscious

382
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,800
to have no external masters

383
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,120
the only power that you need to submit

384
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,440
to is the power of your own

385
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,480
will and personal persons and

386
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,279
individuals

387
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,920
own will should be the only master and

388
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,199
the only power

389
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,399
then you can submit to

390
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,120
what is sovereignty this is my favorite

391
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,079
so

392
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,160
according to many people sovereignty

393
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,839
means feeling comfortable

394
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,839
when being alone having a farm with

395
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,759
potatoes in cow

396
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,720
someone told me about having a gun not

397
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,279
teaching

398
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,199
not learning how to use it not not

399
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,880
having like a couple of guns depending

400
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,320
on the situation like not

401
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,880
not having knives but just i bought a

402
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,120
gun i'm sorry

403
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,040
and lastly i heard a verb

404
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
to sovereign i have no clue what that

405
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,679
means

406
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,839
so if you ask me i would say that

407
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,199
sovereignty is to be able

408
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,319
to uncompromisingly fulfill your own

409
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,520
will

410
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,880
it means to attack your enemies

411
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,319
and to defend against them and

412
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,000
to do that against everyone

413
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,360
who tries to take at least something

414
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,400
away from you and the most important no

415
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
matter what the cost is

416
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,039
so who is sovereign individual then

417
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,120
probably to describe it to describe it

418
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,160
shortly

419
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,320
the evolution of sovereign individual

420
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,520
and free one

421
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,080
can be described like this first

422
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,960
individual makes his own decisions

423
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,280
he does not just give away his right to

424
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,640
do that

425
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,559
second he discovers different

426
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,480
restrictions on his way

427
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,679
and limitations to make his

428
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,720
uh decisions after that

429
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,960
after seeing the limitations he desires

430
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,400
to remove them

431
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
and finally he does that he removes the

432
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,240
limitations

433
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,520
uh second part of the concept and

434
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,840
of the thing that sovereign individuals

435
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,080
should have is knowledge

436
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,520
and here we will talk a bit about

437
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,679
science first

438
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,320
of course the definition so science is

439
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,960
the method

440
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,799
for getting statistically verified

441
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,200
knowledge with technology as its

442
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
application for the sake of real ability

443
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,280
and also we need to understand that for

444
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
the sake of real

445
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,520
reality and robustness

446
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,799
science sacrifices everything else

447
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,640
there is nothing existing besides

448
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,400
besides their uh statistically verified

449
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,240
things so you can apply statis a

450
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,679
scientific method

451
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,720
to learning new stuff to exploring

452
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
what you are to exploring what's

453
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,760
happening around you

454
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,640
and you need to you can do it by

455
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,520
following these

456
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,000
simple steps first you observe then you

457
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,840
formulate a hip hypothesis

458
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
after that you provide an experiment and

459
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,120
then

460
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,200
the refinement of the hypothesis takes

461
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,480
place

462
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,919
pretty simple the downside

463
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,120
of using this method all everywhere is

464
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,240
in that

465
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,720
uh it's not it's effective in minimizing

466
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,760
risk of failures

467
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,280
yes but it becomes highly ineffective

468
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
when you want when you are willing to

469
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,480
risk when you

470
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,600
do not have a lot of data to process or

471
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,039
when you are limited in time

472
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,559
um if you ask me i would say that

473
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,919
in order to become free

474
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,960
and become sovereign you need to know

475
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,240
like

476
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,360
for for science sciences first is

477
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,440
history but

478
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,159
please like this is probably one of the

479
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,760
best quotes that i remember from my

480
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,120
history lessons

481
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,240
at school his my teacher said that

482
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,520
on the first first lesson remember child

483
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,559
that history is the greatest of

484
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,400
all because who writes it

485
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,440
that person or that collective has all

486
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,240
the power

487
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,000
over over the history so a person needs

488
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,679
to know history a lot of it and verified

489
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,000
a bit of biology which includes genetics

490
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,960
biochemistry

491
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,880
physics and biomechanics would also be

492
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,480
good physics

493
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,559
and of course math to visualize this

494
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,000
it should probably be something like

495
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,240
this

496
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,400
somewhere here you have i am not sorry

497
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
um economics which is not even a science

498
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,720
then such sociology psychologists

499
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,919
biologists

500
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,840
chemists physicists and every each of

501
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,039
them thinks that they are like on the

502
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,840
top of the mountain

503
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,360
next to become sovereign individual you

504
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
need to have resources

505
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,240
here i will be pretty fast because

506
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,919
probably a lot of you thought about what

507
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,919
resources you need to you need to have

508
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,520
in order to build something to become

509
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,120
something to have a business whatever

510
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,679
and probably a lot of you thought or

511
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,679
understood that the resources that you

512
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,799
need is time

513
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,559
and money pretty simple

514
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,760
and i will not analyze this part

515
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,000
for a long time i'll just ask you a

516
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,120
question that

517
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,520
is actually pretty important to answer

518
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,600
for yourself not for me

519
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,760
what would you do if you had all the

520
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,720
time

521
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,640
if you had all the resources

522
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,600
well especially if we talk about money

523
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
like if you have time

524
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,720
then money is just a matter of time

525
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
next of course you need to tool you need

526
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,200
the tools

527
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,679
tools can be categorized on four

528
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,720
different perspectives

529
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,480
like many more others but these are the

530
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,520
main ones first digital and physical

531
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,760
and then tools of defense and tools of

532
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,880
attack

533
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,320
here i need to point out that

534
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,960
yes you need to attack people you need

535
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,240
to attack

536
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,600
governments you need to attack

537
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
collectives

538
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120
this is where i do not agree with

539
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,360
non-aggression principle and all of that

540
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,480
that's a different story because

541
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,600
to attack actually means to be smart

542
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,640
enough to be intelligent enough and

543
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,760
to actually have the advantage over your

544
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,960
enemy

545
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,360
and to lose that advantage and not to

546
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,720
strike first

547
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,240
is stupid to say the least

548
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,240
very important thing you still

549
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,400
even if you are sovereign even if you

550
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,440
are an individual

551
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
even if you are free you still need to

552
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,480
have

553
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,600
allies a lot of people know

554
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,360
from probably building businesses that

555
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,640
it's very important to

556
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,200
have good business partners to have

557
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,840
allies that would fight with you and

558
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,000
everything

559
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,320
and a lot of people look for them but

560
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,400
this is what they usually find

561
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,039
they find friends they find lovers

562
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,880
sometimes they even call their parents

563
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,640
allies

564
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,400
which again does not make much sense

565
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,600
my definition of an ally is la is

566
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,720
someone that shares your ethics and your

567
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
core values

568
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
is the one that is willing to pay the

569
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,840
same price

570
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,360
that you pay for achieving common goals

571
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,600
and for protecting the shared values

572
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,360
next privacy every everyone talks about

573
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,640
it probably

574
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
but a lot of people have misconceptions

575
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,320
and misunderstandings there

576
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,360
a lot of people think that privacy how

577
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
they use it

578
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,559
they use privacy to mislead and for many

579
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,440
people

580
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,360
privacy means just lying

581
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,679
also for others it means to hide away

582
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,120
when the bottle come comes over again

583
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,640
just stab your allies in the back by

584
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,320
doing so

585
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,520
and lastly privacy for many people

586
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,919
means to hide information that is

587
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:36,720
crucial

588
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,400
for your allies to know

589
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,440
in order to avoid some losses or to

590
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,279
succeed in your own but in your

591
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,880
common battle so

592
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,200
hiding the information that is

593
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,559
irrelevant

594
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,919
to your allies is

595
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,640
acceptable and it does make sense

596
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,799
because you do not want to overload your

597
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,480
allies and everyone else with all the

598
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,000
information that you have

599
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,840
but hiding the information that is

600
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,520
crucial for everyone else

601
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,080
that makes them that not knowing it

602
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,840
makes them fail

603
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,840
that is not very good

604
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,960
if you ask me i would say that in this

605
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,760
context

606
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,440
in the context of sovereign individual

607
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
kid privacy is

608
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,360
indivisible right of an individual to

609
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,320
explore

610
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,440
learn and grow as an individual

611
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,640
in order to then after that bring more

612
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,279
value

613
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,640
to the common goals and to the common

614
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,279
group of people

615
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,000
to sum up what you need

616
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,400
to become a sovereign individual

617
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,640
first you always need to know what you

618
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,760
want

619
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,799
you must not submit your will on

620
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,279
to anyone's fear to anyone's

621
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,640
desires to anyone's rules to nothing

622
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,240
like that

623
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,960
first you need to educate yourself but

624
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,559
before that

625
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,559
uh when you start educating yourself you

626
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,400
already need to have at least

627
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,600
some basic level of your

628
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,400
own inner system of values that you

629
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,360
verify the

630
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,919
incoming information against without

631
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,880
this system

632
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,200
you will fail without this system you

633
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,120
will never be able to verify the

634
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,840
information

635
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,799
and to actually know is it a real and

636
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,080
worthy data

637
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,360
or is just a white noise also you need

638
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,320
to have of course

639
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,120
as i said resources and tools for both

640
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,600
attack

641
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,559
and defense and this is very important

642
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,039
both

643
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,240
attack and defense

644
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,320
you need to have allies around those

645
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,679
that will be standing

646
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,600
right beside you no matter how hot

647
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,080
the battle becomes and of course you

648
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,240
need to have privacy by default

649
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,320
even amongst your allies even

650
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,279
if you are alone

651
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,120
how in this section i wanted

652
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,039
to show you some less theoretical but

653
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:19,440
more

654
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,840
practical tools but i think we're

655
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,000
running out of time

656
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,120
already so

657
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:35,120
thank you

658
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,320
if you have any questions

659
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,960
if you have any questions please go

660
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,480
ahead do we have any online questions

661
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,279
oh come on really

662
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,399
so why not like know this why are you so

663
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,320
aggressive

664
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,000
no the privacy is not that

665
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,039
no i like no economics it is a science

666
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,120
no nothing when you uh started your uh

667
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,159
very good presentation

668
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,039
you also talked about um you talked

669
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,000
about philosophy

670
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,399
which is a very core underpinning of

671
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,440
every

672
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
it's like a a computer with software and

673
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,200
you

674
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,480
always have to um

675
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
make sure that the base layer is right

676
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,880
in order to build a strong castle on top

677
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,080
of it

678
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,120
and one of the things that to me is very

679
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,000
important

680
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,679
is besides psychology is the field of

681
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:40,080
epistemology

682
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,159
because if you go into that field and

683
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,159
then into economics also

684
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,760
you can optimize your

685
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,640
vision on or your way of thinking about

686
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,399
reality which is very important because

687
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,240
you always have to

688
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,559
analyze information and make

689
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,919
and then sort it out in order to filter

690
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,360
out misinformation

691
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,039
and only uh take into account

692
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,799
correct data and relevant information

693
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,960
is that uh something you also um

694
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,919
think about epistemology what is science

695
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,960
what is knowledge

696
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,399
no honestly honestly no so i do

697
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,039
differentiate between

698
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,039
data data information knowledge and

699
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,799
experience

700
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,760
because a lot of people have huge mess

701
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,720
here

702
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,799
no one even understands where is the

703
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,200
difference

704
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,880
i do see the difference but i'm

705
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,480
not a fan neither of economics

706
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,440
nor epistemology i am a fan of game

707
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,320
theory though

708
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,120
because it's more related to biology

709
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,960
because game theory is

710
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,080
a field which actually can be proven and

711
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,520
can be verified

712
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,720
even by biological information but

713
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,159
if you talk about yeah and

714
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,600
economics it's basically just talking

715
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,720
about nothing without

716
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,679
even having the ability to verify that

717
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,320
so

718
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,520
yeah there are things like that but

719
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,159
if you compare it to biology to physics

720
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,600
to math

721
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,200
i would not use it i would not spend

722
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,080
that much time on it

723
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,520
when you talk about attack and defense

724
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,480
in what regards do you i invent in what

725
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,440
way do you want to attack is it physical

726
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,159
is it uh using technology to destroy

727
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:44,559
your

728
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,919
enemies on the battlefield or in society

729
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:48,640
or

730
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,559
how do you see these things are you

731
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,799
going to destroy the character or

732
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,360
are you going to undermine reputations

733
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,279
or are you going to

734
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,480
in in what kind of uh concepts do you

735
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,120
watch i what is your philosophy like

736
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,799
my background is medical i'm a medical

737
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,399
doctor so i can say that

738
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,360
i prefer the personal approach if in

739
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,480
order to

740
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
attack someone and to protect myself

741
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,840
from someone i need to physically do

742
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,080
that

743
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,600
that's the only option if in order to

744
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,159
crush my enemy i need to just break his

745
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,039
will

746
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,559
as chinese man script teach very nicely

747
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,600
i would go for that it always depends on

748
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,640
the level

749
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,440
on how

750
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,080
how bad the conflict is and what tools

751
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,120
can be used what tools will work and

752
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,640
what will not

753
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,919
i'm not limiting myself in any case

754
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,159
i mean if you have someone pointing gun

755
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,039
at your face

756
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,799
and you have a knife would you even try

757
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,720
to punch him

758
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,039
i think so it might be stupid but still

759
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,480
and if you have someone that tries to

760
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,399
hack your database

761
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,760
or put you in jail you still can use

762
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,519
informational tools for that

763
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,480
for attacking him

764
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,159
but um i'm a fan of economics but from

765
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,080
the austrian school i don't know if you

766
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,320
are

767
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,000
aware of the austrian school of

768
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,919
economics

769
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,360
and that that school also

770
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,000
lays a very heavy emphasis on the on the

771
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,919
concept of opportunity costs

772
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,360
and i think that's that is a very core

773
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,440
uh principle that always must be taken

774
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,120
into account when

775
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,159
uh taking action in uh attack defense

776
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,360
economical moves i think because

777
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,000
in war the ultimate opportunity cost is

778
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,120
your life

779
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,559
so it's quite vital to be

780
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,519
balanced in how you handle that kind of

781
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,200
well very good comment on that

782
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,360
and again if you ask me

783
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,840
i would approach the same topic with

784
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,720
a with probably

785
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,720
neuroscience with biology with genetics

786
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,039
with behavioral algorithms behavioral

787
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,720
patterns

788
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,000
not with economics economics is

789
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,799
unfortunately i mean have you had

790
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,559
einstein of economics

791
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,879
no have you had anyone

792
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,519
i mean albert einstein and me mrs like

793
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,519
come on

794
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,720
human action is 1200 pages of

795
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,399
yes yes i did that and what i do now

796
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,720
is i respond to you according to my

797
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,120
knowledge and my experience

798
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,799
and yeah those guys are great miese is

799
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,000
awesome but

800
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,840
i cannot force myself to read through

801
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,159
all of yeah but i also have a background

802
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,080
i cannot just

803
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,440
i cannot very often see how that can be

804
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,879
applied a and i can often see

805
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,960
how biology proves them wrong

806
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
or cannot verify what they are doing so

807
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,719
if you take behavioral pattern

808
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,879
patterns if you take evolution and if

809
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,320
you take economics

810
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
you can very often see the conflicts

811
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
between them and i'm like with these

812
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,440
guys i'm

813
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,239
i don't come from economics i understand

814
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,359
your point of view but i

815
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,000
myself i come from mathematics and then

816
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,760
went into the social sciences

817
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,480
so i really had uh can i show you the

818
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,839
slide again

819
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,839
with social and mathematics

820
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,839
did you pay attention to it no

821
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,599
yep this one so you come from here and

822
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,839
here

823
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
i came from the right side and then i

824
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,359
made my way to the left side

825
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,720
so okay my favorite my favorite

826
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,320
this one sociologist is

827
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,119
a polish veteran and he wrote a very

828
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,119
popular book in 1972

829
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,160
which was called social sciences as

830
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,960
sorcery very beautiful written book

831
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,839
i i read alchemy if i need to learn

832
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,119
sorcery

833
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,880
or chinese strategies on warfighting or

834
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,480
something like that

835
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,079
works better but i do appreciate your

836
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,079
your thoughts actually and might be we

837
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,680
could have a debate over coffee or

838
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,839
something

839
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,240
i will not spill it in your face relax

840
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,879
hi

841
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,920
okay so my question is when you say that

842
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,720
to attack like i understand if someone

843
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,800
is pointing a guy in at you that you can

844
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,560
defend yourself but that's not attacking

845
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,160
that's defending

846
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,480
but when you say like attack before

847
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,280
someone do

848
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,920
something to you how can you know that

849
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,960
someone will do

850
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,560
something against you if they're not

851
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,880
doing anything yet

852
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,480
there's a very good movie called the

853
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,040
radcliff

854
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,200
uncut version is the best cut version

855
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,160
does not answer

856
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,200
all the questions but so you can imagine

857
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,040
probably the simplest way to describe it

858
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,560
you can imagine yourself

859
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,079
standing on the shore of the lake and

860
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,720
you can see like way over across the

861
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,160
lake you can see the fire

862
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,040
from your enemy and you sort of

863
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,640
understand that he

864
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,359
was not there yesterday he is here today

865
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:47,920
and

866
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,320
about if you look at the flames you can

867
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,599
sort of understand

868
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,200
when the attack from his side will

869
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,680
happen if you understand that

870
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,839
and if you know that you a understanding

871
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,119
that and knowing that is already an

872
00:36:59,119 --> 00:36:59,680
advantage

873
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,200
because you can do something with that

874
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,720
information

875
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,640
b why not to do something with that

876
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,440
if you see an army standing in front of

877
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,240
your face

878
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,079
and you know that it's gonna attack you

879
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,160
tomorrow and you have

880
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,720
already everything prepared and they are

881
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,240
still preparing for the battle

882
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,839
why not to crush them before they get

883
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,160
prepared

884
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,720
like in in this case i think it's the

885
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,960
same as having a gun pointing at you

886
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,640
so uh

887
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,040
it's heaven not directly hey

888
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,000
it's still about heaven and information

889
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,560
yeah

890
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,720
information on how your opponent and

891
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,920
your enemy will

892
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,960
act the next second to be able to

893
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,760
uh make prognosis on that yeah but you

894
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
cannot be 100

895
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,640
like you cannot see the future so if you

896
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,880
see someone across the river

897
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,280
with fire you cannot be sure that they

898
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,320
are attacking you they

899
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,800
maybe they're just there and here we

900
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,960
come probably to

901
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,079
a thing which is called intellect if

902
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,680
you're intelligent enough

903
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,880
you can calculate the further steps yes

904
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,680
not 100

905
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,920
sure yes with some some biases also

906
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,480
but you can calculate your enemies uh

907
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,359
next steps

908
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,079
and by doing that you if you have like

909
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:22,960
90

910
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,599
probabilities that it will happen it

911
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,000
will happen

912
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,920
and also like you can have you can use

913
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,920
at least those two methods to calculate

914
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,880
that yeah sure

915
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,599
like maybe you would guess it right but

916
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,599
if you say that's okay to attack

917
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,520
if you think someone will attack you

918
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,920
then you're saying okay

919
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,800
for everybody that they can just guess i

920
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,000
think someone will attack

921
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,160
me based on nothing and then you're like

922
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,720
saying okay you can react because

923
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
you guessed it that they will attack you

924
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,960
so i think it's a very dangerous thing

925
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,040
to say okay you're allowed to attack

926
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,880
before someone attacks you

927
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,359
like it's it's not fitted for everybody

928
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,320
like

929
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,680
well it's well a it's

930
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,440
yeah you need to be not a fifth

931
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,599
grade child to do that and to calculate

932
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,480
that

933
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,400
and which means to have at least some

934
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,839
knowledge some experience

935
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,359
especially at failing in battles

936
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,480
and uh again

937
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,560
one of the core ideas is to educate

938
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,599
yourself

939
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,320
and to educate yourself not does not

940
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,800
mean to graduate from one university and

941
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,280
then

942
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,480
have a career it means to have

943
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,520
uh to read a lot of books to try a lot

944
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,480
of stuff

945
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,560
to know what works for you what doesn't

946
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,320
and to actually like

947
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,880
train your brain to be more intelligent

948
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,320
than an average monkey

949
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,320
but it's your responsibility it i mean

950
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,800
if you're a human if you have brain why

951
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,320
not to use it

952
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,240
but then i just think you're expecting

953
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,720
too much from everybody

954
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,760
i don't think like one

955
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,680
ninety percent of the people are really

956
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,880
willing to learn and to be educated so

957
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,400
i think it's just i i agree more with

958
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,160
the non-aggression principle because

959
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,839
then you're setting a barrier

960
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,000
from the beginning on like then

961
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,960
everybody can

962
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,160
have you heard about the fence paradox

963
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,920
no no so fans paradox is basically

964
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,119
you have a cliff and you have a person

965
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:29,839
like

966
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,960
standing near the edge uh

967
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,240
it has been verified from biological

968
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,359
perspective

969
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,160
then the person would rather not fall

970
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,119
over

971
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,880
inside into the cliff like from the

972
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880
cliff if you put

973
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,319
a fence there everyone who comes over

974
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,920
would try to lean

975
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,960
over it fifty percent of people

976
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,160
just fall inside setting up some

977
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,640
artificial barriers

978
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,680
they never work you can even see

979
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,480
how children behave if you set up some

980
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,079
artificial barrier

981
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,079
they will still be too curious they will

982
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,839
be curious to break it

983
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,200
they will be curious to know what's

984
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,440
about the barrier and they will harm

985
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,240
themselves

986
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,720
more and probably everyone else around

987
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,359
so

988
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,920
i do not see the reason why we should

989
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,960
just have a

990
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,480
threshold for that i mean

991
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
that is not the threshold that i would

992
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,839
set for them

993
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,480
let me put it like this because yes i do

994
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
not talk to dumb people for example

995
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,200
and i can say openly that they are dumb

996
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,599
and i do not care

997
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,920
i do have some thresholds but they are

998
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,520
not artificial and they are not

999
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,760
you are forbidden from to do this and

1000
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,200
that

1001
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,799
they come from totally different system

1002
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,240
i mean if you give a couple of monkeys a

1003
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,839
couple of guns

1004
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,200
you will have more oxygen right

1005
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,079
eventually it's good for the kids also

1006
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:06,480
and

1007
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,359
for the college

1008
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,640
hi um hey so my question is

1009
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,680
you talk about values isn't values

1010
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,880
a um a way to

1011
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,160
limit yourself are they not is not

1012
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,000
i mean we have values that are handed

1013
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,680
down from us from our from our

1014
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,560
society and from our parents but we also

1015
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,760
have our own values

1016
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,000
and that is a limitation this is what we

1017
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,760
use to

1018
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,359
um what we use to uh

1019
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,079
to limit ourselves in what we do what we

1020
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:46,800
can do

1021
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,280
and also how we value how we measure

1022
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,920
things

1023
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,520
whether they're valuable or not a very

1024
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,079
good point

1025
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,920
i have an inner value like my own

1026
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,800
to not commit suicide is it a

1027
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,119
restriction yes

1028
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,920
is it good for me i think so is it good

1029
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,560
for everyone else and not so sure

1030
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,760
so good for what

1031
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,680
good for whom and again

1032
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,880
uh values are i cannot say that they are

1033
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
restrictions

1034
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,000
values so i i value my

1035
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,119
life more than committing suicide

1036
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,400
i do understand that i value my will

1037
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,359
a lot and i will not do it to my will

1038
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,960
my core value is my will i cannot

1039
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,839
restrict it

1040
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,040
by committing suicide

1041
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,000
so i do not see

1042
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,400
i cannot say that values are

1043
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,240
restrictions

1044
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,760
i cannot even say that principles are

1045
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
restrictions

1046
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,400
i mean if you have experience about

1047
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,760
something if you

1048
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,599
failed at something if you lost

1049
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,480
something you sort of understand that

1050
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,920
if you do that again that will happen

1051
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,680
again you will still lose you will again

1052
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,720
fail and everything like that do you

1053
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,319
call that a restriction also

1054
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,359
i mean it's common logic

1055
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,800
common sense uh self

1056
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,599
defense at some point from your own

1057
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,599
stupidity what was the um the old story

1058
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,079
that

1059
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,839
the definition of madness is doing the

1060
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,040
same thing and expecting different

1061
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,640
results

1062
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,680
um so yes i mean that's obviously

1063
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,880
it's not something you do but you do

1064
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,400
learn from your stakes you tweak it a

1065
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,440
little bit you try again

1066
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,200
maybe you fail again of course that's

1067
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,040
just going back to the scientific method

1068
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,160
you know um and yet

1069
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,319
and so the fact is you don't want to

1070
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,079
have the same outcome

1071
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,000
so you don't do it again so that is a

1072
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,680
restriction say don't do it again

1073
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,839
because you're going to have the same

1074
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,560
outcome

1075
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,000
but what i'm talking about is personal

1076
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,520
restriction not external restrictions

1077
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,319
uh uh okay yeah can you rephrase then

1078
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,000
please

1079
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,520
um so what i'm saying by

1080
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,400
about values is a personal restriction

1081
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,400
on how you see life and how you measure

1082
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,359
things

1083
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,200
it's not i'm not talking about external

1084
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,359
um um

1085
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,960
i'm not talking about external because

1086
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,640
external would be against my libertarian

1087
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,839
beliefs

1088
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:32,800
because i don't want to tell other

1089
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,200
people how to do it

1090
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,319
okay so uh

1091
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,520
is discipline also a restriction

1092
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,200
it's a restriction i would think that

1093
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,399
i would probably tell again that if you

1094
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,480
if you do something that does not make

1095
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,560
sense for you

1096
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,119
you can call that a restriction but

1097
00:45:59,119 --> 00:45:59,599
again

1098
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,319
if you do that again and again it would

1099
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,440
be useless you would

1100
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,960
be just wasting your time resources

1101
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,200
money health whatever doing something

1102
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,880
that is not yours

1103
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,480
so it's not it's not artists like

1104
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,880
artificially put barriers

1105
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,720
it's understanding that something does

1106
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,640
not work for you so why

1107
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,680
why would someone even do something that

1108
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:29,839
it's not not working for him

1109
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,760
well those are especially time like time

1110
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,440
is the most scarce resource

1111
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,040
i have experience the the more money i

1112
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,960
have the less time i have

1113
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,200
but less money i have the more time i

1114
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,240
have

1115
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,160
like this year been it's been amazing

1116
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,280
because i had no

1117
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,079
income but i had all the time in the

1118
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,160
world i could have

1119
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,640
and i actually i don't want to have any

1120
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,760
more money

1121
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,240
i want to have more time but i'm looking

1122
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,920
for the third thing

1123
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,720
that is actually you talking about time

1124
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,240
and money where is the third one

1125
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,000
what do you mean where is the third one

1126
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,119
i don't want time i don't want money i

1127
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:13,520
want

1128
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,160
something else you do not want time no

1129
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,680
okay i don't want time i have all all

1130
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,960
the time i want

1131
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,640
i was talking about suicide like five

1132
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,200
seconds ago

1133
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,000
i mean you don't want it it's a shame

1134
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,440
that you cannot just take your time and

1135
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,000
give it to someone else

1136
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,160
i i'm 55 years old and

1137
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,960
i have experience that was a good

1138
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,359
comment

1139
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,480
fell down three four times already we

1140
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,319
have twin towers come down

1141
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,520
the business is full we have pandemic

1142
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,400
businesses it's not a panda me eh coffee

1143
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,000
is not a foundation yeah well whatever

1144
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,119
it is

1145
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,640
uh but i'm talking you talking about

1146
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,200
time

1147
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,480
and money okay the more uh hey i was not

1148
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,160
talking just about time and money in

1149
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,520
general and it's like all of the

1150
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,000
resources

1151
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,839
that you have you have you need to have

1152
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,520
much more resources than just time and

1153
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:09,920
money

1154
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,920
it's just uh i wanted to raise a

1155
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,280
question which is pretty much important

1156
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,720
because a lot of people do not know

1157
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,240
how to use their resources properly

1158
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,400
especially time they have no clue

1159
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,359
what to do with their time this is why

1160
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,440
for many people immortality never makes

1161
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,319
any sense

1162
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,760
because what the would i do with it

1163
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
terrified i'm terrified i have a lot of

1164
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,680
i have too much time

1165
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,520
terminate terminate yeah but people

1166
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,200
spend too much time in

1167
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,480
like stupid things you know for sure

1168
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,599
personally i think personally when you

1169
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:42,240
have both

1170
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,319
type time and money the only thing where

1171
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,280
you can find your

1172
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,760
egg is like spiritual development to my

1173
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,559
opinion

1174
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,040
and for the rest nothing matters more

1175
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,680
once you

1176
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,640
pass the stage of materialism and power

1177
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,520
the next fastest

1178
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,640
[Music]

1179
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,880
i would a good comment but i would tweak

1180
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,160
it a bit

1181
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,839
uh i would not call it a spiritual

1182
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,359
development

1183
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,119
uh i would call it the development or

1184
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,440
your of your inner will

1185
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,359
your development of what of your inner

1186
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,440
will your will that's part of the

1187
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,079
spiritual

1188
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,359
development probably well yes but uh it

1189
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,559
um the spiritual development

1190
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,880
is very uh is on the top of the iceberg

1191
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,640
on the tip of it and actually uh

1192
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,200
making yourself and making your will

1193
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,119
expanding

1194
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,160
into the outer world more and more

1195
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,160
that so for that some sort of

1196
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,079
how people call it spiritual development

1197
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,160
