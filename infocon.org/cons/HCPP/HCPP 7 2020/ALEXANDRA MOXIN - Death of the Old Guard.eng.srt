occupy

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,399

lands here in prague i wanted to

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,960
dedicate this talk to peter hingins

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,120
so please take a moment if you don't

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,160
know peter

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,840
peter was a writer programmer and

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,760
thinker who spent decades

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,400
building living systems and online

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,960
communities

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,119
he's an expert in distributed computing

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,640
having written over 30 protocols and

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,400
distributed software systems

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,680
he designed amqp in 2004 and founded the

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,040
xeromq

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,240
free software project in 2007. for those

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,720
who are in bitcoin you'll possibly see

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,080
0mq referenced

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,840
um he's a strong as a strong critic of

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
the patent system peter actually led the

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
european effort to ban software patents

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,040
from 2005 to 2007

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
and there's a really wonderful quote

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,000
from digital revolution uh

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
the patent system has no function other

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,759
than to enable gangsters dressed in

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,280
suits to call themselves honest

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,399
businessmen

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,200
um so he's a very prolific author uh

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
please take a look at some of his books

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,479
unfortunately peter is no longer with us

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,920
but his memory lives on

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,750
okay my abstract

54
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,079
[Laughter]

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,680
how do i explain this i'm going to cover

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,878
a lot

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,920
and i'm going to gloss through a lot uh

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,680
in order to tell you the full story i

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,959
think it's important to see

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,040
the origin and genesis of things so that

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,160
we may change the system

62
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,599
as mentioned at the beginning i won't

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
have time for questions likely

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,040
but i will monitor the live stream after

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,400
and feel free to reach out to me here

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,599
this is the anchor quote power tends to

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,160
corrupt

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,160
and absolute power corrupts absolutely

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,720
very wise words and i think that's

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,239
something we see as a theme throughout

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,720
history

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,120
um so still begins the

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
uh review of the command and control

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,560
system

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,000
the that have lived um for many many

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,239
years

77
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,599
so we're starting with fiat

78
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,400
um it's defined as a formal

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
authorization or proposition

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,519
and a decree

81
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,720
the idea typically a monarchy will use

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,400
this

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
the idea is to control the levers of

84
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,920
power which are typically

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
the key levers of power which are

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,040
typically

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,760
knowledge resources and time you

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
maintain power

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,959
by forcefully subverting the will of the

90
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,319
people

91
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,400
and violently and violently opposing

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
alternate views

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,840
it's very important if you're part of

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,560
the system to rule by fear

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,599
it's going to get a little bit dark

96
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,360
so we have on this screen

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,640
some not the nicest people

98
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,000
what what i wanted to point out about

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,239
this is that

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,000
the ends here um while insidious

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,599
um are well terrible

102
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,000
it starts out by usually painting an

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,760
unjust situation

104
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,799
in an appeal to mankind's better natures

105
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,840
and better nature so you've got

106
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,560
you've got here stalin so stalin

107
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,479
led the soviet soviet union for more

108
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,840
than two years

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400
he forced quick industrialization and

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,080
collectivism in the 1930s

111
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,720
imprisoned millions of people in labor

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,199
camps and was responsible for the great

113
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,280
purge of the intelligence yeah

114
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,199
which he is responsible for installing

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,800
in some cases

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,120
um again as i mentioned i'm glossing

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,199
over some of this but i will include

118
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,880
more expanded speakers notes so you can

119
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,479
find out more about

120
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,720
the genesis of these these people and

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
how they gained power

122
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,919
which is what i found very interesting

123
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,919
so essentially he consolidated power so

124
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,600
nearly all of the central command

125
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
owed their position to him and before

126
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,039
they could see it coming

127
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,840
then he attacked

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,440
he convicted people of being enemies of

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,759
the

130
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,360
convicted people as being enemies of the

131
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,520
people and had them summarily executed

132
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,560
next is

133
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,120
the leader the first leader of the the

134
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,720
people's republic of china

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,720
and chairman of the ccp so mao zedong

136
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,840
as also known as chairman mel

137
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,840
he was chairman from the establishment

138
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,199
uh starting in

139
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,120
the establishment of the ccp starting in

140
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
1949 until his death

141
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,039
any opposition to his regime was swiftly

142
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,000
suppressed

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
while people support or while people say

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,960
that he

145
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
made some significant changes uh those

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
significant changes that were forced

147
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,560
through were responsible for the deaths

148
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,479
of 40 million people

149
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,080
primarily through starvation forced

150
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,000
labor and executions

151
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,880
not to leave the women in the group

152
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,919
uh so mary uh this is bloody mary

153
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,199
uh mary tudor she's the only child of

154
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,880
king henry and catherine of aragon she

155
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
became queen of england in nineteen or

156
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,360
fifteen

157
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,759
eighty fifteen fifty three uh and

158
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,680
reinstalled catholicism in a state that

159
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
was protestant

160
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
she summarily over the next few years

161
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
burned hundreds of protestant believers

162
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,120
at the stake

163
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
and for that she earned the nickname

164
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
bloody mary

165
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
moving on to karl marx

166
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,400
he's a german philosopher and

167
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,319
revolutionary socialist

168
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,639

169
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,880
manifesto and death capital

170
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,759
he was expelled from belgium france

171
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,880
prussia

172
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,720
and finally resided in london although

173
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,039
they never fully accepted him

174
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,159
and never

175
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,560
sorry they essentially denied him

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,599
citizenship but

177
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,199
he was allowed to stay

178
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,919
what's interesting about him is while he

179
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,680
was in london he founded the german

180
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,199
workers educational society

181
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,479
and worked as a journalist for about a

182
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,560
decade but never earned a living wage

183
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,240
now the common theme throughout all of

184
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,560
these is

185
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,759
you have communism socialism and you're

186
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,880
starting to see that reflected in

187
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,919
today's

188
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
i struggled with the term for it woke

189
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,360
movement if you will

190
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,240
and cancel culture so essentially you're

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,800
seeing

192
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,080
a group of people that feel like they've

193
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,360
been

194
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,360
not seen by society and

195
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,400
society seems more open to hearing the

196
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,440
um their concerns um i do think that we

197
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,120
get caught in the weeds quite a bit

198
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,720
and um

199
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,000
yeah it's it's something that again

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
it starts out small you want to make

201
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
concessions for people that feel like

202
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
they've been marginalized

203
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,160
but what ends up happening is

204
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
the extremes of that are are very

205
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,479
dangerous places

206
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,080
and it it ends up um where dissenting

207
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,599
opinions can be

208
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,080
you can be faced with a an actual firing

209
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,279
squad

210
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,039
which is not a not a good place to be

211
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,919
so how does this come to be so

212
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,478
essentially

213
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,880
gaslighting is a form of psychological

214
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
manipulation where a person or group

215
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,279
covertly sows seeds of doubt in a

216
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,519
targeted individual or group

217
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,399
this leads to the person questioning

218
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,720
their memory perception judgment

219
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
and it evokes cognitive dissonance

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
so this is what happens when

221
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
people are

222
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,480
at the very beginning this is one of the

223
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
mechanisms and i i strongly encourage

224
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,680
people to

225
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,160
look at peter henson's psychopath code

226
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,000
he explains a lot of the mechanisms

227
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,200
involved in this thinking process and

228
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,360
and how it's used throughout humanity to

229
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,560
achieve some really uh

230
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,200
truly awful aims and means

231
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,959
so i want to get into the fall of rome

232
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,959
so now we've seen dictators now we've

233
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,080
seen the

234
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,760
command and control kind of ruling

235
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,519
system and model

236
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,000
what's important is to show how through

237
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,720
history

238
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200
we have revolutions and revolutions tend

239
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,640
to

240
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,959
beget dictators and then those dictators

241
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,080
tend to be suppressed

242
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,320
by the next revolution and those

243
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,600
revolutionaries become the next

244
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
dictators and it's like a wave

245
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,519
throughout history uh and i'm not

246
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,760
talking in in terms of you know decades

247
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,360
these are in terms of centuries so

248
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,240
you'll see some

249
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
some broad themes going back to the

250
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,320
roman times there was a really strong

251
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,600
state presence there was philosophy

252
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,920
um we had you know free thinking we had

253
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,000
democracy we had some of the greatest

254
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,399
philosophic minds aristotle socrates

255
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,040
plato

256
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
get more into this towards the end of

257
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,480
the presentation but what was really

258
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,120
interesting

259
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,079
is that rome as an empire was considered

260
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
one of the greatest military powers uh

261
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,200
in the world and it fell

262
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,800
it fell primarily for these eight things

263
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,839
and i do have in the the notes uh links

264
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,000
that to the full case study this is not

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
uh not my work but i am reference it

266
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
referencing it because it was important

267
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,399
to

268
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,480
illustrate this point um so essentially

269
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,600
um the broad arc is that

270
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,279
rome became too big oppressive

271
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,079
it had oppressive taxation inflated the

272
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,720
money

273
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,360
it was rife with corruption that

274
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,040
weakened the system so that eventually

275
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,279
it became vulnerable to attack

276
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,120
so it's the too big to fail mentality

277
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,160
so you can see all of these points it

278
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,120
was invaded by

279
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,160
multiple tribes and again i'm glossing

280
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,800
over this

281
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,440
vastly but i encourage you to read the

282
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,720
the source material

283
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,959
and and look at the the actual case

284
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,800
study i would like to spend a little bit

285
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,920
more time on this but i

286
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,600
am aware that i've got a lot of material

287
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,839
i need to go through

288
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,240
one thing that i'd like to point out

289
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,519
that's a little bit polarizing on this

290
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,160
slide

291
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
is you'll see you know invade invasion

292
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
overreach overspending

293
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,440
corruption oppression and uprising

294
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,600
what sticks out here is christianity and

295
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
what's interesting and i'm going to go

296
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
into this in the next section

297
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,560
um roma ancient rome was a polytheistic

298
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,920
society whereas

299
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,440
christianity is monotheistic and

300
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,680
to say that the induction of

301
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,120
christianity

302
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,839
was part of the destruction of the

303
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,000
regime

304
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,639
is a little bit it glosses over the

305
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,279
point

306
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,720
but essentially what happened is you've

307
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,120
got a new system coming in and

308
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,320
it's completely opposed to the existing

309
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
beliefs of the people

310
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
so when people are not heard in the

311
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
system that they're used to growing up

312
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,880
in then you can meet with some very

313
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,560
violent

314
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,079
situations and terms and

315
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,440
it's something that's quite interesting

316
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,920
exploring

317
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,200
toward the end rome was not able to keep

318
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,000
its

319
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,839
soldiers so they had to go to soldiers

320
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,600
of fortune

321
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,720
that they they had wavering loyalty to

322
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,760
the the empire

323
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
and uh quite often were responsible for

324
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,839
attacking the the empire

325
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
directly

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,959
a new rolling class

327
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,509
[Music]

328
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,880
okay so

329
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,240
it's important to acknowledge this

330
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
beautiful passage

331
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,320
these words were hijacked and i believe

332
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,200
the message

333
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,320
corrupted in a new institution

334
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,120
as a new institution arose assuming the

335
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,519
power expressed in these words

336
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,639
but stay tuned peaceful revolutionaries

337
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,399
have always been called out as dangerous

338
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,240
in their time

339
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,839
they are to the ruling class

340
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,760
so moving on to the church and broadly

341
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,360
if you look at the ark of power it's

342
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
gone from the state

343
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,560
and now it's flowed into the church

344
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,120
i refer to the church as the keepers of

345
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,519
wisdom

346
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,839
so the next this next part uh will be

347
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,360
very challenging to you

348
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,000
uh if you're highly religious so i ask

349
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,920
that you suspend your judgment

350
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,839
and just listen

351
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,040
so words of freedom um that were

352
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,160
essentially used to enslave

353
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,000
where would we be if the dark ages never

354
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,839
happened if truth and knowledge wasn't

355
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,320
suppressed

356
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,920
jesus was literally put to death for

357
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
challenging power

358
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,519
and this is the power of the state

359
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,440
before the

360
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
teachings were brought into the church

361
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
one of the interesting things is as the

362
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,079
teachers were brought into the church it

363
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,320
was determined by the nicean council

364
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,079
they essentially selected what teachings

365
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,839
from the original teachings

366
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,760
would be allowed to be included in the

367
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,040
bible and

368
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,240
you can bet that a lot of the a lot of

369
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,519
the messages that would have challenged

370
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,120
their their rule and their power were

371
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,839
not included

372
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,880
so by doing this by determining what

373
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
message could be heard

374
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,240
essentially censoring the message

375
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,480
the church could control and dictate

376
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,320
what is true and what is known

377
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,240
so this is a very important point at the

378
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,320
very top of the slide

379
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,399
if you questioned their authority you

380
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,360
were branded a heretic

381
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,199
by divine authority which was unknown to

382
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,639
the the common people

383
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,720
only a privilege privileged few could

384
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,199
know all

385
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,680
and if you think back to galileo and the

386
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,880
heliocentric view of the universe

387
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,440
the fact that that was that way of

388
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,800
thinking which is correct

389
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,240
was deemed a crime uh by the church

390
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
is monstrous

391
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,639
so i wonder where we would be a society

392
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,759
were that knowledge not suppressed and

393
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,040
were we maybe allowed to question and

394
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,399
reason and

395
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,120
approach the scientific method versus

396
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,079
the

397
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,079
being enslaved by the the religious

398
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,079
dogma of the the ruling class at the

399
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,319
time

400
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,160
what's interesting is if you look at the

401
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,279
dark ages and the enlightenment and

402
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,480
again i'm gonna move on

403
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,639
so moving on to the rise of the global

404
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,959
state

405
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,440
and what's important to note is that as

406
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,639
these

407
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,000
i guess epochs progressed um

408
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,639
it wasn't uh it's it's never a straight

409
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,120
line

410
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,560
um the existing system will be crumbling

411
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,240
while a new system is rising

412
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
and this is something you'll see toward

413
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,519
the end of the talk which i believe

414
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,279
we're exhibiting uh we're living through

415
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,160
right now

416
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
uh the the crumbling of the old systems

417
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
that we've grown up with that we were

418
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,399
told to trust that we have now um it's

419
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,160
now been proven that well i think it's

420
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,360
always been proven

421
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,199
anytime somebody says just trust me you

422
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,479
should run far far away

423
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,720
so moving on to robber barons so back in

424
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,079
the 19th century

425
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,240
which was cited as america's gilded age

426
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,359
so this is the 1800 time period

427
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,599
successful industrialists whose business

428
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,160
practices were often considered

429
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,559
ruthless or unethical they would have

430
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,640
poor working conditions

431
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,799
they were selfish and full of greed

432
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,559
which is not necessarily a bad thing but

433
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,760
when you're subjugating people it

434
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,039
definitely is especially if they're

435
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,799
suffering

436
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,720
it was common practice to intentionally

437
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,199
restrict the production of goods

438
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,240
and then raise the prices

439
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,000
you had railroad tycoons during the

440
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,799
1800s

441
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
being given special treatment for the

442
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,679
government financing

443
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,360
essentially they extensively used

444
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,039
lobbyists to appeal to the government

445
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,520
um broadly the government their

446
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
politicians and their state

447
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,880
representatives

448
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,960
um so if you look at politicians they

449
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,880
were essentially made men

450
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,760
um and indentured servants to the ruling

451
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,039
class and i know that's a very bold

452
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,840
statement but if you look at how the

453
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
how the people who succeeded at the top

454
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,880
actually succeeded

455
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,520
there was a lot of absolute abject

456
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,960
criminality happening

457
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,520
and if you make the rules um you

458
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,880
determine what's a crime and what's not

459
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,799
a crime but i think if we all look at

460
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,440
this in the

461
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,360
the lens of history we'll see that it

462
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,120
was very very

463
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,840
uh criminal

464
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,960
um so from this period we essentially

465
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,559
see the rise of the global elite

466
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,440
so previous to this time we had smaller

467
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,280
populations

468
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,600
more local government now we're starting

469
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
to see the rise of global

470
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,960
the global vision which i'll get into in

471
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,240
the next slide

472
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,400
so we have the institutions today that

473
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,679
we are told to trust

474
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,840
uh that give us this wonderful uh

475
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,440
ordered world

476
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,160
uh global economy we've got the bank of

477
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,080
ins uh

478
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,799
bank of international settlements was

479
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,919
established in

480
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,200
193 1931 in the netherlands

481
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,000
it's now headquartered in switzerland

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,679
and it's recognized by

483
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,679
all the countries uh in the world as the

484
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,799
headquarters of the

485
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,480
financial world every central bank is a

486
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,799
member

487
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,240
next we have the world bank and

488
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
international monetary fund

489
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,520
essentially through the imf

490
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,240
the imf oversees the stability of the

491
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,679
world's monetary system

492
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,799
while the world's bank world bank's goal

493
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,919
is to reduce private reduce poverty

494
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,919
by offering assistance to middle-income

495
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,520
and low-income countries

496
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,120
but how they do this is quite predatory

497
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,799
they essentially loan money so they help

498
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,760
by creating debt and then the recipient

499
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,600
country is then beholdened

500
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,080
beholden to the imf and it's a

501
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,640
definitely a form of control

502
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,320
again i'm glossing over this i encourage

503
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,559
you to if you're at all interested

504
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,559
look at how these organizations operate

505
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,320
and look at the conditions

506
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
in which they were constructed the

507
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,559
societal conditions uh where you've got

508
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,840
the

509
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,520
people making the decisions um enabling

510
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,640
through lobbies through um

511
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,840
through the the rules that they

512
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,240
determine our law

513
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
these uh how these institutions were

514
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,640
allowed to rise

515
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,039
um one common thing that you'll note is

516
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,640
in all of these institutions

517
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,960
it's all about harmony cooperation

518
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,559
global peace these all sound like really

519
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,440
great things

520
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,799
and they are um but good principles can

521
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,760
be used to enslave

522
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,679
um moving on we have the i have the i

523
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,039
couldn't

524
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,799
we have the united states federal

525
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,559
reserve representing

526
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,760
federal banks

527
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,039
these are the money printers so money is

528
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:53,760
now

529
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,480
so how money is issued it's issued

530
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
electronically as a credit

531
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,320
and then banks can then borrow against

532
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,679
these funds

533
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,120
and i think because we're all in bitcoin

534
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
we all know that uh

535
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,200
there's nothing that really anchors that

536
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,120
value other than by fiat

537
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,600
and that is by decree it's because we

538
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,960
say this is the money

539
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,480
it is the money and therefore it's

540
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,000
valuable but there's

541
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,640
really nothing intrinsically valuable

542
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,280
about it

543
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
and as we've seen this past year i mean

544
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,360
look at all the governments worldwide

545
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,080
who have

546
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,799
just vastly over inflated their their

547
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,200
money supply

548
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,480
it's quite concerning if you're not

549
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,080
incredibly concerned you definitely

550
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,679
should be and it's definitely something

551
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,799
you should be looking at

552
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,120
um it's difficult because it's not a

553
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,039
system that we directly control

554
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,960
um but there is bitcoin and i will get

555
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,240
into that toward the end of the talk

556
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,200
we also have the united nations

557
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,120
this was formed shortly after the war in

558
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
1945

559
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,480
it's comprised of it's a cooperative

560
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,799
body

561
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,360
focused on securing peace and monitor or

562
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,400
fostering

563
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,919
global economic social and environmental

564
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,280
goals again this sounds great

565
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
it's comprised of the general assembly

566
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,640
the security council

567
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,480
the economic and social council the

568
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,120
trusteeship council

569
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,200
the international court of justice and

570
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,960
the u.n secretariat

571
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
and all of these bodies work together

572
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,120
again to foster global harmony peace

573
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,320
trade economy uh all things that sound

574
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,120
great and

575
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,320
i think as as a as an organization it

576
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,000
should exist but we should examine its

577
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,640
motives from time to time

578
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,679
and and just make sure that the um

579
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,960
the will of the people is not being

580
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,679
subjected uh and taken advantage of for

581
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,280
people who can profit

582
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,640
uh off it and again profit is not in an

583
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,799
intrinsically bad thing but when

584
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,640
suffering is involved

585
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,640
um it's it definitely can be

586
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,159
it definitely is and i think that

587
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,000
sometimes these these global

588
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,200
institutions the

589
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
um the powers that be seem too big

590
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,640
and how can you possibly take a stand

591
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,159
and i think for years

592
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,600
you know we've seen throughout history

593
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
we've seen anyone who spoke out against

594
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,240
the system

595
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,360
uh be summarily executed either

596
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,880
literally unfortunately and we have many

597
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,640
examples of this

598
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,880
or essentially shunned by society

599
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,840
so beware when asking questions is

600
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,400
is not allowed because the minute you

601
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,600
can't ask why

602
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,959
there's a huge problem brewing

603
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,799
um i encourage you all to go to

604
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,000
wtf or what the happened

605
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,520
in 1971.com

606
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,919
this is when the uh so essentially this

607
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:58,880
is when

608
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,039
the u.s currency came off the gold

609
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,000
standard

610
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,320
prior to 1971 the us dollar was backed

611
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,799
by gold

612
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,480
it served as the world reserve currency

613
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,360
as established in 1945

614
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,600
in the bretton woods accord so

615
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,320
if you think about what's happened since

616
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,600
1971

617
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,640
and the divide between

618
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
the top one percent having most of the

619
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
money

620
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,080
and the poorer classes getting poorer

621
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,360
and poorer and poorer

622
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,760
the erosion of the middle class the

623
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,640
american dream

624
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,000
north american dream um

625
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,559
you know what we've essentially by these

626
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,520
institutions

627
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,320
told is is what we should have as far as

628
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,279
a good life you know you work hard

629
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,559
which i will get into shortly

630
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,159
you know if you work hard you'll be

631
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,480
rewarded and it's somewhat of a lie

632
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,720
it's difficult though because at its

633
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,840
core at its essence

634
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,520
it's true if you do work hard if you do

635
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,679
put in the time you will benefit and

636
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,480
prosper

637
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,120
but in an unfair system the odds are

638
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,719
very much stacked against the individual

639
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,960
next is we have fang

640
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,159
which is facebook apple

641
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,000
amazon netflix and google

642
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,320
this is the new global elite system if

643
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,679
you will

644
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,640
i call these these groups the

645
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,240
information dealers

646
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,000
much like drug dealers which

647
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,400
it's a bold statement but information

648
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,640
really is the currency of our time

649
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,919
and we are very much being taken

650
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,200
advantage of we are very much the

651
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,480
product

652
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,360
um there's the idea that uh the product

653
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,840
of the

654
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,600
the free information system that we can

655
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,279
we can participate in where we can share

656
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,120
with our friends we can connect with

657
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,000
people from school

658
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,240
we can connect with colleagues we can

659
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,039
connect with people all over the globe

660
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,960
the connection was something that was

661
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,720
really fostered

662
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,080
in these social networks as they were

663
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,760
set up

664
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
and the ability to freely transact share

665
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,880
information across

666
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,240
borders commerce across

667
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,360
borders you know all of these companies

668
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,000
unlock

669
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,720
and enable that however there's a darker

670
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
side

671
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,159
in the social system and this is the

672
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,159
talk that we we had last night uh

673
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,080
talking about the social dilemma so if

674
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,840
anyone is interested go back to the live

675
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,400
stream

676
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,799
uh and we we talked about the netflix

677
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,919
documentary the

678
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,600
the social dilemma and kind of the

679
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,120
darker side of social media because

680
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,320
there definitely is a darker side um

681
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,440
essentially with social media you have

682
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,600
information warfare

683
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,559
with the polarization of of thought you

684
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,279
have

685
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,559
something that's right when something

686
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,000
that's wrong something that's left

687
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,600
something that's right

688
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,720
and each time you interact with groups

689
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,360
or you take a look at youtube is a

690
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,559
really good example

691
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,440
you can watch one thing and then if you

692
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,240
have your

693
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,679
recommendation on you know the next

694
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,279
video is good

695
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,039
and then by three or four all of a

696
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,720
sudden you're

697
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,880
you're you're slowly being directed down

698
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
a path that maybe you didn't choose

699
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,400
and i think that that's one of the

700
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,880
things that that is endemic to society

701
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,000
today

702
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,799
is we've lost the ability to have civil

703
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,000
discourse

704
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,480
we've lost the ability to suspend our

705
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,200
judgment

706
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,600
to understand the other point of view

707
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,200
and this is

708
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,240
very dangerous because life is not black

709
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,960
and white

710
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,399
life is gray there are multiple truths

711
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,120
there is not one truth and i think the

712
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,520
fact that we've been sold that for

713
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,880
centuries and it's often dictated by the

714
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,320
people at the top the people that are in

715
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,799
control

716
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,200
the people whose power is derived by

717
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,840
what you believe

718
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,200
so with the social media model we

719
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,399
essentially have the birth of the

720
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,120
attention

721
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,559
economy which is something to be

722
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,520
very aware of

723
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,918
okay

724
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,360
in the the source material i have uh

725
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
listed a link to

726
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,159
youtube recording of john lennon's

727
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,399
working class hero

728
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,840
i think it perfectly sums up the

729
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,440
what we were taught about the system

730
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,480
versus the actual reality

731
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,600
so i'm going to read a little bit

732
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,679
and i highly encourage you if you don't

733
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,679
know this song to to go

734
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,960
listen to it so

735
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,399
when they've tortured and scared you for

736
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,399
20 odd years

737
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,360
then they expect you to pick a career

738
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,720
when you can't really function you're so

739
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
full of fear

740
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,679
a working-class hero is something to be

741
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,840
they keep you doped up with religion and

742
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,080
sex and tv

743
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,360
and you think you're so clever and

744
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,320
classless and free

745
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,080
but you're still peasants as far

746
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
as i can see

747
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:13,840
a working-class hero is something to be

748
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,000
again this is something i'm going to

749
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,919
gloss over vastly but please take the

750
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,840
time to go and read it

751
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,320
so ellie dukeman is

752
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,000
um

753
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,480
um essentially this is this nobel speech

754
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,880
he was awarded the the nobel peace prize

755
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,679
and uh this was essentially he was the

756
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,720
first director

757
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,640
of the international peace bureau which

758
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,919
still exists today

759
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,120
uh originally it was founded uh in

760
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,159
geneva

761
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,679
uh sorry in baron and it now resides in

762
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,799
or exists in berlin

763
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,039
definitely take the time to learn more

764
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,880
about it

765
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,320
it's essentially um again

766
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,559
um there's more information on this

767
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,799
slide than i'm able to talk about

768
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,840
in in full depth like i'd like to uh but

769
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,360
what was really interesting is

770
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,360
uh what he does in his his nobel lecture

771
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,120
it shows throughout time

772
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,120
the the ridiculousness of wars

773
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,840
um war is again created nothing is

774
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
consolidated nothing

775
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,679
it served merely to a base human nature

776
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,240
and plunging nations into anarchy

777
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,919
and it's always the people controlling

778
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,679
um the wars

779
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,600
who benefit is always the people who

780
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,360
suffer and this has been played through

781
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,960
time and time and time and time again

782
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200
for centuries so he has a he does a

783
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,000
really nice job

784
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
of illustrating those wars throughout

785
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,360
history

786
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,600
it's probably about a 15-minute read i

787
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,960
highly encourage that you

788
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,360
you take the time to go read it it just

789
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,960
gives a nice perspective because this

790
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,440
was

791
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,399
created at the beginning of the 1900s

792
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,200
his talk

793
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,440
um and it gives a nice view as to what

794
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,559
the world was like

795
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,440
back then before we had social media and

796
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,600
everything was available at all time

797
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,120
uh yeah

798
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,200
okay moving on to new rome

799
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,919
so at the beginning i started out uh

800
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,120
talking about

801
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,760
the fall of rome and how we started out

802
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,600
with the the senate and like democracy

803
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,559
is not new

804
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,399
um if you look back at the uh if you

805
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,840
look back at the

806
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,480
uh athenians and all of the philosophers

807
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,760
and i'll get more into this

808
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,080
as we move forward um it's been a

809
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,519
reoccurring theme it was the power of

810
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,440
the

811
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,880
power of the state and then it moved

812
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,799
into the power of the church

813
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,399
and then again became the power of the

814
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,480
state and you'll see these wide arcs

815
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,279
throughout history it's important to

816
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,080
step back

817
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,399
and not just focus on what's happening

818
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,440
now i think

819
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,120
right now we're experiencing all of this

820
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,279
which is which is really unfortunate

821
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,320
um we're so focused on surviving day to

822
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,799
day especially during this pandemic

823
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,600
we're focused on our literal survival

824
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,279
previous to this we were focused on just

825
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,000
getting through

826
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,399
month to month maybe year to year

827
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,399
focusing on your job focusing on

828
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,679
where you'd like to be in a few years

829
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,159
but really having that narrow focus

830
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,080
just having enough money to get by

831
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,480
unless you were smart and invested

832
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,919
and it's something that you know if you

833
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,519
if you make a fortune you can quickly

834
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,480
just as easily lose that fortune uh so

835
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,360
being able to

836
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,799
pick up and and carry on uh in a corrupt

837
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,440
system

838
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,600
that is very much stacked against you as

839
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,320
a very difficult thing to do

840
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,559
so i think being able to take that it's

841
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,320
a luxury to be able to take that longer

842
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,519
viewpoint

843
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,919
and to examine history examine the root

844
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:36,559
causes

845
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,000
which we'll get into shortly with first

846
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,880
principle thinking

847
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,399
for the time being though i'd like to

848
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,080
give an interesting aside

849
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,199
to um

850
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,200
america the great experiment

851
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,279
so between the war of independence and

852
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,440
the forming of the constitution

853
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,200
the founding fathers understood it was

854
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,960
important to check the power

855
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,559
uh of the ruling class

856
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,720
otherwise it ended up in uh tyranny

857
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,640
the war of independence was initiated by

858
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,320
the 13 original

859
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,039
colonies against the kingdom of great

860
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,360
britain

861
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,799
so this was essentially fought

862
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,360
over their objection to parliament's

863
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,320
overt

864
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,000
taxation and lack of representation and

865
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,600
lack of colonial representation in the

866
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,320
um the kingdom of great britain

867
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,039
so thomas jefferson has a really good

868
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:43,519
point

869
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,720
that when all governments

870
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,720
domestic and foreign shall be drawn to

871
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,159
one central power in this case

872
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,840
washington

873
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,279
it will render powerless the checks

874
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,480
provided of one government on another

875
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,760
and will become as venal and as

876
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,440
oppressive as the government from which

877
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,000
we separate it

878
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,519
so what's really interesting in the the

879
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,919
great american experiment is

880
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,599
how they recognized because they came

881
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,599
from a system of what they felt was

882
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,960
unfair tyranny and oppression and

883
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,960
overtaxation

884
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,760
and they wanted to remake essentially

885
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,520
forge their own lands and

886
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,440
remake their constitution where it

887
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,719
allowed for

888
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,239
um more dispersed power

889
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,800
more decentralized forms of government

890
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,159
so what's really important

891
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,199
is within the constitution

892
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,560
there's something known as the bill of

893
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,960
rights

894
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,719
so this is a really interesting model of

895
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,959
governance because it specifically

896
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,839
specifically limits federal power

897
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,839
so it's the first 10 uh the bill of

898
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,000
rights is the first 10

899
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,599
amendments to the founding constitution

900
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,760
the constitution was created in 19

901
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,560
sorry 1787.

902
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,680
and the bill of rights was crafted uh in

903
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,040
1991

904
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,520
what it does is it protects individual

905
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,720
rights and freedoms

906
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,480
and there are so many countries around

907
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
the world that don't have a document as

908
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,760
specific as this

909
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,280
what's very interesting about america is

910
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,880
they recognized that

911
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,560
uh consolidated power uh if you're

912
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,520
in a system of consolidated power it's

913
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,040
the individual essentially doesn't stand

914
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
a chance

915
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,560
so by creating this new form of

916
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,599
government it was at least a first step

917
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,000
at empowering the individual to be in a

918
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,200
more fair

919
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,640
staging system it's interesting to see

920
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:42,960
how

921
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,640
it's i guess in the 250 or so years

922
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,839
that it's been in existence how

923
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,560
how things have have been and if you

924
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,680
look at america now

925
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,079
um the state it's in versus the state of

926
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,880
its founding

927
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
it's very divided and polarized one

928
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,560
might argue that it's

929
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,400
similar to well

930
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,520
i want to be really careful what i say

931
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,240
but right now it's very divided and i

932
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,839
think a lot of the founding principles

933
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,119
um are are not

934
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,560
there um and i don't know that that's

935
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,520
something that

936
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,839
there's criticism about this model

937
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,839
because

938
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,200
some say that it works in a smaller

939
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,760
society and what's interesting is one

940
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,280
form of government one form of

941
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,320
governance

942
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,640
one form of society does not work

943
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,520
forever

944
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,680
there's change as people come into the

945
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,880
society society as new ideas emerge

946
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,440
things change and if you stick to the

947
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,720
one thing that worked

948
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,440
and you're not at all flexible to it it

949
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,960
can be eroded very quickly

950
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,440
and or you'll have something as awful as

951
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
a revolution

952
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,079
um but what's important to note

953
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,359
is that there are some founding

954
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,200
principles uh if you look at the the

955
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,640
great american experiment

956
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,560
that are quite interesting to to see

957
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,320
really important quote here by reagan

958
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,520
so ronald reagan one of the state's uh

959
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,480
presidents in the early 1980s uh

960
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,000
capitalist

961
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,400
freedom is never never more than one

962
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,720
generation away from extinction

963
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,480
we didn't pass it to our children in the

964
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,400
bloodstream it must be fought for

965
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,160
protected

966
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,240
and handed on for them to do to do the

967
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,479
same

968
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,839
so what's important here is wha where

969
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,280
well what's important one thing i'd like

970
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,000
to call out is when

971
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,760
he says it should be fought for that

972
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,640
doesn't mean a violent seed a siege

973
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,560
um what's interesting is that he says

974
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,680
protected

975
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,880
so it's something that you must actively

976
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,880
live through throughout your life and

977
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,240
make sure that

978
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,440
the principles these principles of

979
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,200
freedom as you see them eroded that

980
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,680
you're

981
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,280
you're on it you're on top of it because

982
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,040
if you're not they are very quickly

983
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,480
taken away and i think we're seeing that

984
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,920
also right now

985
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,200
uh with kovid and the the horrible

986
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,000
lockdowns

987
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,560
and the um the way that they were

988
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,480
enacted it was originally supposed to be

989
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,720
two weeks to slow the spread and and now

990
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,079
we've got global economic collapse

991
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,680
of course there's second wave that's

992
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,920
happening now and i don't want to get

993
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,680
too too much into this because it's a

994
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,440
situation that's kind of unknown

995
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,079
and when it comes to when it comes to

996
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,760
health you can't say well just go back

997
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,839
to work i'm sure you'll be fine

998
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,240
because if if you don't know the the

999
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,680
situation if you don't know how deadly

1000
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,640
something is and

1001
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,880
i don't think it is as as deadly as it's

1002
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,160
being made out to be but

1003
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,320
perhaps it is and if it is then it's

1004
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,520
something we do need to take

1005
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,040
seriously so it's a really tough spot

1006
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,240
because what's happened is that we've

1007
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,800
been

1008
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,160
we've allowed um control to come back in

1009
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,760
and we're essentially prisoners in our

1010
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,280
houses during lockdowns

1011
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,560
there are a number of countries that are

1012
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,720
going through lockdown again

1013
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,560
which is awful

1014
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,800
essentially we've become prisoners of

1015
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,320
the state

1016
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,839
it's for our own health it's for our own

1017
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,599
good will

1018
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,480
but is it

1019
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,720
so it's a tough it's a very very tough

1020
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,359
situation to be in

1021
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,598
okay

1022
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,119
so moving on to the peaceful revolution

1023
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,960
so i've talked about the systems of of

1024
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,720
command and control

1025
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,960
and now there are some things that we

1026
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,079
can do

1027
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,280
again i'm going to gloss over this

1028
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,440
because i've only got five minutes left

1029
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,960
but i think if we look back to the

1030
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,320
ancient state and the ancient

1031
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,160
philosophers

1032
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,920
and we look at these four cardinal

1033
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,079
virtues

1034
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,079
so again this is going back to ancient

1035
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,599
ancient rome

1036
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,079
ancient greece i believe in order to

1037
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:50,960
move forward

1038
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,440
we need to look back and as we can see

1039
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,200
democracy is not new

1040
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,119
so these principles are wisdom

1041
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,000
in stoicism which is essentially the

1042
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,119
ability to

1043
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,400
use knowledge experience and

1044
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,880
understanding common sense

1045
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,800
and insight valor which is known as

1046
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
courage

1047
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,079
essentially it's a willingness to

1048
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,160
confront agony pain danger

1049
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,560
uncertainty and intimidation

1050
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,760
you've got physical courage and you've

1051
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,480
got moral court courage

1052
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,359
so essentially it's the ability to

1053
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,480
temporarily suffer

1054
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,720
so that you may benefit going forward

1055
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,920
justice and justice is a difficult one

1056
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,280
because what is just

1057
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,040
versus what's just in a situation

1058
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,160
is subjective and definitely not fair

1059
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,480
justice is a very very difficult thing

1060
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,920
because in order to be impartial and

1061
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,280
just to all parties

1062
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,880
you essentially can't be there's got to

1063
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,440
be a winner and a loser so

1064
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,119
it's almost like you've got a temporary

1065
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,839
armistice in in decisions

1066
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,400
but it's important to weigh the the

1067
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,520
checks and balances

1068
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,319
of the situation from either side to

1069
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,680
ensure that one person is not

1070
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,800
consistently benefiting over another

1071
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,560
person or another body

1072
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,880
and if they are to perhaps make it so

1073
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,319
that it's a little bit more even

1074
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,480
without going full communism full

1075
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,640
socialism because that's also a danger

1076
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,560
i believe the next is temperance

1077
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,599
temperance is essentially moderation so

1078
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,000
this is the ability

1079
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,079
to withhold and to restrict

1080
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,280
so that you may be more in control of

1081
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,920
your natures

1082
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,200
first principles first principles are

1083
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,960
really important

1084
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,359
essentially you learn to take something

1085
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,160
apart

1086
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,400
test the assumptions and reconstruct it

1087
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,839
so this is going to the root cause of

1088
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:54,400
things

1089
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,880
not just accepting uh this works because

1090
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,920
it's been passed down through

1091
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,800
generations as

1092
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,520
well as it works as it's because people

1093
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,560
have said that it works

1094
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,280
essentially it's hacking if you will um

1095
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,720
it's figuring out where the breaking

1096
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,160
points are in a system

1097
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,920
and making it stronger making it more

1098
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,160
robust through the act of questioning

1099
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,440
through the act of breaking something

1100
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:13,920
down

1101
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,560
you make something stronger um we see

1102
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,319
this all the time in in bitcoin

1103
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,160
um arguments are you know recognized and

1104
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,280
i think appreciated here more so than

1105
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,440
um keeping the

1106
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,520
more so than keeping everyone happy i

1107
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,720
think we've we've

1108
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,960
mostly realized at least i hope so by

1109
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,720
now that keeping everyone happy

1110
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,200
is impossible you can't there are always

1111
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,119
going to be people that are subjugated

1112
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,560
and they're also they're always be

1113
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,240
people that suffer but i think

1114
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,920
we need to be careful about crossing

1115
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,480
over into that point where people are

1116
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,960
cruelly subjugated for the benefit of

1117
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,599
others

1118
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,200
versus the people who benefit and the

1119
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,920
people who don't it's a really big topic

1120
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,000
i don't have time to get into it

1121
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,680
i don't know that it could even be

1122
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,119
discussed in

1123
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,319
you know in a day

1124
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,359
definitely not in a day

1125
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,400
okay moving on i think we all know these

1126
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,040
words they're from eric hughes uh

1127
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,480
cypherpunk manifesto

1128
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,960
in 1993.

1129
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,640
i'm going to read you something

1130
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,480
essentially open source

1131
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
is a really important principle of this

1132
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,880
movement keeping your code

1133
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,599
open available to all available to

1134
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,240
modify

1135
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,560
freely there are a number of interesting

1136
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,359
cypherpunks

1137
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,480
i definitely think you should look at

1138
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,760
richard stallman and timothy may and

1139
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,040
tim berners-lee adam back

1140
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,800
nicolas savo and and many others

1141
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,240
and essentially what they're focused on

1142
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,960
is is writing code

1143
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,640
not necessarily solving the big world

1144
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,240
problems but taking things on

1145
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,200
one step at a time

1146
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,200
knowledge has always been passed down

1147
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,160
outside the system

1148
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,839
in a corrupt world truth must be

1149
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,560
obscured

1150
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,680
so that it is preserved

1151
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,480
encrypted communication allows privacy

1152
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,000
giving you the ability to

1153
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,880
selectively reveal a body of knowledge

1154
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,000
to whom you choose

1155
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,839
at the right time

1156
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,000
in the meantime travel to the

1157
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,760
underground of the subconscious mind

1158
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:36,560
for all knowledge exists uncorrupted

1159
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,119
i hope we all know this if we don't if

1160
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,319
people are watching this on a live

1161
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,960
stream

1162
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,760
uh for those watching who don't know

1163
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,440
this is the bitcoin genesis block

1164
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,680
and what's really interesting is the

1165
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,880
message you'll see

1166
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,319
it's the headline in the january 3rd

1167
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,440
2009 edition of the times

1168
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,839
the headline is the chancellor on the

1169
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:00,720
brink

1170
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,119
a second bailout for banks which was

1171
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,319
the the first global economic collapse

1172
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:08,800
that

1173
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,119
we've seen in our lifetime uh prior to

1174
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,160
that would probably be the great

1175
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,119
depression

1176
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,520
uh some have said that the 2008

1177
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,040
financial collapse is worse

1178
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,720
we had endemic monty money printing

1179
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,000
and um bitcoin was created from that

1180
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,480
which is

1181
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,640
well not from that that's glossing over

1182
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,560
quite significantly

1183
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,280
but for in the 1990s cypherpunks were

1184
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,079
very interested

1185
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,400
in electronic cash electronic forms of

1186
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,280
money

1187
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,319
allowing for privacy and i think

1188
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:43,759
bitcoin was the way it was created

1189
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,040
it wasn't advertised there's no ceo and

1190
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,839
it just it just works it just builds

1191
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,160
it's built up through

1192
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,880
through time enough through

1193
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,040
proof-of-work

1194
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,000
i'm i'm glossing over this completely i

1195
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,440
apologize

1196
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,680
i definitely think that bitcoin is

1197
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,560
something that

1198
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,520
unlocks much it's a very slippery slope

1199
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,240
to

1200
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,079
being able to it essentially unlocks

1201
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,920
first principles uh if you look into

1202
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,599
bitcoin if you get really into it

1203
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,440
you start questioning you start asking

1204
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,280
why about things and then

1205
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,800
it's not just about the money you start

1206
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
asking why about other things which i

1207
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,599
think is a really important thing

1208
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:26,880
there's an interesting quote here from

1209
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,640
satoshi and

1210
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,839
i kind of wonder so november 2008

1211
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,920
about a month after the bitcoin white

1212
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,880
paper was

1213
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,240
released which was october 30th 2008

1214
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,240
there's a bulletin board discussion

1215
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,359
where criticism

1216
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,440
is that you'll not find a solution to

1217
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,160
political problems in cryptography

1218
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,359
so valid point and satoshi's response uh

1219
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,280
yes but we can win a major battle

1220
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,760
in the arms race and gain new territory

1221
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,720
of freedom for several years

1222
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,240
um he gives a view of

1223
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,760
napster and pure p2p networks

1224
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,839
and and shows essentially that they

1225
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,520
remain uncorrupted

1226
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
so perhaps bitcoin does have a chance

1227
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,960
and as we see

1228
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,880
you know about 12 years later yes it

1229
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,319
does and it's uh

1230
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,760
it's something i think that is a truly

1231
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,480
global phenomenon very interesting

1232
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,240
we've fixed the money which is good

1233
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,280
but we we haven't won

1234
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,200
um if satoshi taught us anything is that

1235
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,119
the individual now stands a chance

1236
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,960
against the unrelenting wheel of power

1237
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,280
and corruption and we do but

1238
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,079
we can't just give up we can't just stop

1239
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:40,640
and say

1240
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,440
great we fix things now we must

1241
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,720
now we must carry on and make sure that

1242
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,919
that system stays fixed

1243
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,880
the the system that is subverted by

1244
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,040
those that are are now in power

1245
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,640
uh is always looking for ways to get

1246
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,480
back in power and

1247
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,520
if we if we must always guard

1248
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,839
um the the solid value that we have in

1249
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:06,720
bitcoin um

1250
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,240
to ensure that it's not corrupted and

1251
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,440
there are many attacks that have

1252
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,400
happened

1253
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,559
uh throughout history we've seen you

1254
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,860
know the segwit2h2x attack

1255
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,559
[Laughter]

1256
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,160
i'm being told that i'm running out of

1257
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,040
time so i'm gonna go quickly through

1258
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,680
these next

1259
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,559
slides so bitcoin may be small and young

1260
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:23,680
in relative terms but

1261
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,599
one giant you to the command and

1262
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,319
control model

1263
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,839
these are some sources of inspiration

1264
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,359
that i encourage you to check out

1265
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,359
it's essentially zine culture we've got

1266
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,640
citadel 21

1267
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,160
we've got hacker quarterly which has

1268
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,839
been around for a very long time

1269
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,200
and we have 21 is 21 ism which is a

1270
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,680
a new graphic novel explaining what

1271
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,599
bitcoin might look like in the future

1272
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,559
these are very easy to easy to read

1273
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,839
what's interesting is people say that

1274
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,599
there's no bitcoin culture and i

1275
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,839
argue that i disagree um i think there

1276
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,160
is and i think we're seeing that here

1277
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,720
what's interesting is it's uh you know

1278
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,839
the creativity behind it

1279
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,200
the next thing i'd like to leave on is

1280
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,880
the concept of the remnant

1281
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,800
uh this is something that francis puglio

1282
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,559
recently presented

1283
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,480
um in plebstech and the idea is that

1284
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,839
uh it's the story of jove um again

1285
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,960
go to this link go to isaiah's job

1286
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,040
by the mises institute it's been

1287
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,200
reproduced it was originally

1288
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,119
appearing in the atlantic atlantic

1289
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,960
monthly in 1936

1290
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,520
and essentially it's the story of um the

1291
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,800
story of the prophet isaiah

1292
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,400
who's told to tell tell people

1293
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,240
that do i have two more minutes

1294
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,760
no okay so go look into this um

1295
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,280
and and learn about the concept of the

1296
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,200
remnant anyway i'm out of time

1297
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,720
that's me find me on on twitter

1298
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,030
um thank you

1299
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,430
[Music]

1300
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:09,178
