00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,440
hey everybody uh

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,800
so i'm douglas rushkoff i mostly write

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,120
books and make documentaries about

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
uh digital society um

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,359
i was originally a theater director in

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:19,760
my

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,119
uh in my 20s and i got

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,119
fed up with theater because of how

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,560
elitist it was at least

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,519
in america in the 1980s where people

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,560
would spend

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,479
you know fifty dollars to come see a

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,480
production of three penny opera

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,760
and it felt to me that theater which

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,800
which was originally

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,399
an almost interactive uh modality

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,440
had become very uh one directional we

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,000
were

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,079
all telling the same story with the same

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,680
kind of climax

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,600
and uh really just to help people

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
feel good about themselves and not

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,640
create any

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,840
political change you know there was no

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,119
uh you didn't go to a brecht show and

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,119
run out of the theater and throw bricks

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,040
at windows or anything you just

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040
felt good that you could you know cry

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
for gay people or black people it was a

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,760
way for

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,200
liberals to soothe themselves and um

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
so just as i was reaching my my peak of

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,520
of disdain for elitist arts and theater

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,400
the the net came up you know real

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,920
interactivity happened

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,040
and i i guess with young optimistic eyes

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,079
you know i had my first uh

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,799
networking like experience when i was on

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,360
a

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,439
on a terminal and i had to save my first

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,040
program that i had written

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
and i remember i was asked do you want

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,240
to save it

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,360
as a read-only file

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,320
or a read write file and it was at that

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,040
moment

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,360
it was as if i had dropped 10 hits of

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,479
acid

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,680
and i thought oh my gosh media all media

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,320
could be saved as read only or read

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,960
write

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,199
and how much of the world that i'm

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,239
living in

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,080
has been saved as read-only files but

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,760
these things could actually be read

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,599
write files you know and

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,319
and i looked at everything from from the

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,040
the

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,680
the architecture of buildings and the

61
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,400
the

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,319
grid pattern of the new york new york i

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,599
lived in new york city and

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,200
the streets were you know they're in a

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
grid in new york and

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,599
all of a sudden i realized oh they

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,519
didn't just happen someone designed them

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,440
to be this way that not all cities

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,760
are grids and and i looked at money

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,000
saying well why is money read only

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,480
what happens if money is read right well

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,640
they put you in jail that's the only way

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,560
they could stop money from being a read

74
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,440
write medium

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,200
is by putting people in jail and who's

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
that and why does money have to be a

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,160
monopoly

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,159
so i i my eyes opened

79
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,200
to the possibility for an

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,720
open source reality on the one hand that

81
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
that that everything was up for grabs

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,920
that

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
that all of the stories that we are

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,959
living are

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,720
actually um choose your own adventures

86
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,800
and the second thing that happened to me

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
in those those early days of networking

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,879
when i was on the well

89
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,400
and echo and the net time list was i was

90
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,000
i was starting to see human society

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
less as a society of individuals

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,000
competing for

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,440
scarce things and much more as part

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,200
of a connected a connected whole

95
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,760
and yeah it was a psychedelic vision and

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,640
a little bit

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,120
you know crunchy and lefty and crazy and

98
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,640
new age but it was

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,440
also based in what what i saw as a a

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,439
a more accurate is this someone saying

101
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:55,920
to me

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
make my hide my chat window to make

103
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
video window bigger

104
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,599
i can let me if i hide my chat window

105
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,879
then i won't see if you send me a

106
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,040
message though i don't know if that's to

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
me

108
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,159
i can't tell well if it's to me then

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,360
someone says so

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,880
um otherwise i'll just keep going so

111
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,440
i uh

112
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,520
where was i um right so i started to

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
think about human beings as being more

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
connected i got into the gaia hypothesis

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
i started looking at evolution as a team

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
sport the

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
the things we know about trees being

118
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
connected in the soil and sending

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
nutrients to each other that they're not

120
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,360
actually

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,880
they're not actually competing with each

122
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
other so

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
i just checking the text here to make

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,600
sure everything's good all right um

125
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
and as i as i thought about it it

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,400
seemed that the the digital

127
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,440
the possibility of digital would

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,240
uh both kill capitalism because we would

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,919
no longer have centralized currencies

130
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,680
that could be enforced like that

131
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,840
and it could kill the cult of the

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,720
individual

133
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,080
you know the the uh uh

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,880
this this uh you know illusion that

135
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,080
we're all living uh

136
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,039
uh you know quite individually now let

137
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,160
me see there's a mission

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,160
i'm fine okay it's all good um

139
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,520
so it seemed to me that we the

140
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,880
possibility

141
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,039
for digital you know after reading guys

142
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,880
like norbert weiner and learning about

143
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,120
cybernetics and feedback loops

144
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,800
was that this very linear unidirectional

145
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,479
growth based exponential

146
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,680
kind of tech bro white male

147
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,360
colonial westward

148
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
time-based expansion was

149
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
going to end itself that that

150
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,199
cybernetics would create

151
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,400
feedback loops and force a kind of

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,039
circularity a kind of a karma a kind of

153
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,919
a feedback

154
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,039
and iteration that would portend the end

155
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,840
of civilization as we knew it and lead

156
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,560
to

157
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,840
a uh a connected

158
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,479
holism a a presentist non-future leaning

159
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,280
um essentially in all the best ways

160
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,400
anarchic

161
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,520
uh anarchic civilization and so while

162
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,880
i'm enjoying all that

163
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
and starting to write books about here

164
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,759
it comes you know the new mondo 2000 rs

165
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,639
electronica psychedelic timothy leary

166
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,880
uh driven grateful dead um

167
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,759
gaia hypothesis david boehm implicate

168
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,120
explicit order

169
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,800
fractal reality um there was a whole

170
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,840
other group

171
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,560
you know who saw in the internet a

172
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,360
threat

173
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,280
to business as usual a study came out in

174
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,599
1994

175
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,680
that showed that the average internet

176
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,720
connected home

177
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,120
was watching nine hours less commercial

178
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
television a week

179
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
right so that meant war right people are

180
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,080
online

181
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,319
talking to each other instead of

182
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,280
watching

183
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,639
advertising and this meant that

184
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,759
that uh they were losing their ability

185
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,039
to stoke all of the unnecessary

186
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,000
consumption

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
that was required for capitalism to

188
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,919
continue

189
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,319
and wired magazine came along and still

190
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,919
to me and i'm not that old wired

191
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,759
magazine feels like a late

192
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,160
comer to this you know they showed up

193
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,080
around 1993

194
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,960
and declared themselves oh we are the

195
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,000
spokespeople

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,680
for the digital revolution and they

197
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,120
recontextualized the whole thing

198
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,240
as uh surveillance economics as we are

199
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,720
living

200
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
in an attention economy and while real

201
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,520
estate online is infinite

202
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,919
human attention what they called eyeball

203
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,720
hours

204
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,120
are limited so we've got to create you

205
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
know sticky websites

206
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,160
is what they originally called it you

207
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,240
know sticky websites to capture

208
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,879
eyeballs and get more eyeball hours from

209
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,599
people

210
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,639
and then eventually um surveillance and

211
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
manipulation

212
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,720
and you know i remember when when

213
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
timothy leary used to talk

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
about um taking acid which was the

215
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,440
closest thing

216
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,240
from to my to my mind you know lsd is

217
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,919
the closest thing to the internet

218
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,240
um those two experiences were so similar

219
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,039
for me

220
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,440
when when he talked about lsd he said

221
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
the two things that matter most are your

222
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,080
set

223
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,560
and your setting meaning the mindset

224
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,000
that you go into it with

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,399
and the setting the place where you do

226
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,279
it so

227
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,760
the original set and setting of the

228
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,559
internet

229
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,760
was you know expansion of the

230
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,560
the human nervous system and the setting

231
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,040
was

232
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,160
the the uh you know the dorm rooms

233
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,440
and clubhouses of the west coast

234
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,040
uh counterculture and after wired

235
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,399
magazine the set

236
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,440
and setting of the internet were

237
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
um surveillance manipulation and

238
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
growth based exponential competitive

239
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
capitalism

240
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,160
so if 25 years later the whole world is

241
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,720
filled

242
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,360
with digital technology and our set in

243
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,000
setting

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,040
were surveillance and control then

245
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,080
no wonder the whole world is now having

246
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,279
this extremely

247
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,480
bad trip right we are we are

248
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
trying to run our society on an

249
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
essentially psychedelic substrate

250
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,920
with that sentence setting so now

251
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,720
what's happening is we are using

252
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
technology on

253
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,720
humans instead of creating technologies

254
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,920
for humans

255
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,640
to use and this is a really dangerous

256
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,440
place

257
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,800
it's it's really an extension an

258
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,959
exacerbation

259
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,680
and amplification of the things i

260
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,160
thought

261
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,720
the internet would free us from this

262
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,519
very

263
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,640
western understanding of subjects

264
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,760
and objects if you're not a subject then

265
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,360
you're an object if you're not the

266
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,640
person who's acting

267
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,959
you're the one who's being acted upon if

268
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,480
you're not in command

269
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,680
then you are being controlled and that

270
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,279
all comes you know that's really what my

271
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,880
work's been about is to see

272
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,519
where did this come from so we can i i

273
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,480
can try to almost

274
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,760
either memetically or or magically if

275
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,720
necessary

276
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
kind of um undo some of these uh

277
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,959
underlying assumptions

278
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,880
and it seemed to me that one of the big

279
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,600
ones was was empirical science

280
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,360
itself you know francis bacon the uh

281
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,160
european kind of father of empirical

282
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,880
science

283
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,240
what he said what we could do with

284
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
science and this is a quote

285
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,640
he said we could take nature by the

286
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
forelock

287
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,600
hold her down and submit her to our will

288
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,640
so the guy who's the father of empirical

289
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,200
science

290
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,320
basically sees science through the lens

291
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,200
of a rape fantasy right science is this

292
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,959
woman we're gonna hold her down by the

293
00:10:58,959 --> 00:10:59,680
hair

294
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,480
and submit her to our will as if that's

295
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,880
what

296
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,519
that's our relationship to the world and

297
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,480
i understand

298
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,040
you know that oh like women and darkness

299
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
and soil and bugs and

300
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,680
witches and forests and the moon and all

301
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,760
that it's like oh this is all scary dark

302
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,279
we don't know what's going on here

303
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,240
intimacy and wet and moisture all right

304
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
so we're gonna we're gonna

305
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,040
hold it down right we're gonna hold it

306
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,720
down somehow and

307
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,240
we we forced that mindset

308
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,560
onto the digital so we see the digital

309
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
as a way to control

310
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,120
the world i remember when when timothy

311
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,279
leary read the book media lab

312
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,079
by stuart brandt it was about mit's

313
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,000
nicholas negroponte's media lab which

314
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
is now kind of gone down in infamy

315
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
because of the the epstein scandals

316
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,959
but when he read that book he said these

317
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,360
are

318
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,240
guys who are trying to recreate the womb

319
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,079
that they had maybe bad relationships

320
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:54,959
with their mothers

321
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,639
they never got over the fact that their

322
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,399
mother couldn't predict everything they

323
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,040
needed

324
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
when they needed it no they couldn't uh

325
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,760
understand what the child wanted

326
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
so they want to create a world with

327
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,519
predictive algorithms and

328
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,839
robot girls and tubes and things to

329
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,519
bring them everything they want you know

330
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,639
like a womb

331
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,959
with a view so you get a screen and you

332
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
can just float in your little isolated

333
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,399
um in your little isolated thing and

334
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
you know that lead lead uh

335
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
led us i'll call it us let our

336
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,720
civilization

337
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,880
to use technology as as a way to control

338
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,240
uh people and nature that we reversed

339
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,760
what we would call figure

340
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,160
and ground instead of it being people

341
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,120
using tech

342
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,320
we created texts to use people so first

343
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,600
it was to use women

344
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
then it was to control people of color

345
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,839
and now and the reason why finally

346
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,279
people are making little movies and

347
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,040
getting upset about it even in silicon

348
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,519
valley

349
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,440
it's because we're using it on ourselves

350
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
we are controlling our own

351
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,680
cognition you know whether it's um

352
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,160
through um using uh bj fogg's techniques

353
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,120
in stanford

354
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,000
to to try to use captology to addict

355
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,720
people and

356
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
to take the the algorithms from slot

357
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,639
machines and put them into our news

358
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,360
feeds

359
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,240
or to use big data in this manipulative

360
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,200
way where

361
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
and we know what's happening on facebook

362
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,760
is they use the data we leave behind

363
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,959
us to put us in statistical buckets

364
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,000
and then send us uh

365
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
information and put things on our news

366
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,120
feed that get

367
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,760
us to behave more true to our

368
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,519
statistical profiles

369
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,360
the the object of the game is not just

370
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,440
to sell us a particular thing

371
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
but to get us to act more like whatever

372
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,160
it was they predicted whether they

373
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,920
predicted we're going to get divorced or

374
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,560
decide

375
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,360
we're gay or go on a diet they want to

376
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,680
get

377
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,480
their 80 percent statistical accuracy up

378
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,519
to 85

379
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,040
or 90 and that means taking the 20

380
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,360
of people that they were wrong about the

381
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,279
20 of people who were going to

382
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,040
to do some anomalous different behavior

383
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,160
and get them to fall into line it's

384
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,720
it's quite literally it's auto-tuning

385
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,680
humanity

386
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,240
to the quantized places no you're like

387
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,760
in between this group and that

388
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
we've got to auto-tune you to get there

389
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,959
and what is

390
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,199
tuning auto tuning is is erasing soul

391
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,199
you know can you imagine auto tuning

392
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,360
james brown or somebody trying to reach

393
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,120
up to the note or come down over the

394
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,760
note

395
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,720
that's not the noise the place where

396
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,639
you're away from the quantized

397
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,519
uh the quantized demarcation that's the

398
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,240
signal

399
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,399
that's who you actually are that's what

400
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,360
makes you more

401
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,160
than than a a digital grid that's what

402
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,880
makes you

403
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,600
that's what makes you human and then

404
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,279
meanwhile these technologies

405
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,480
end up enforcing a a a

406
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,519
social reality of low rapport you know

407
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,639
you don't

408
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,199
actually i mean it gets close sometimes

409
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,720
but you don't actually connect with

410
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,760
other people

411
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,399
online in a way that your body and dare

412
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:00,800
i say

413
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,120
soul can feel it you can't see if their

414
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,639
pupils are dilating or

415
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,480
or contracting when you're speaking with

416
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,079
them you can't see the micro motions of

417
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:08,800
their head

418
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,560
you can't see their skin flushing you

419
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
can't tell if their breathing is sinking

420
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,600
with yours

421
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,320
and those are all of the painstakingly

422
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,519
evolved

423
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,680
mechanisms that we develop to establish

424
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,399
trust between humans and all of those

425
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,079
are are negated in these spaces so you

426
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,639
might say on a skype call you say that

427
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,240
you agree with me

428
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
and i know that you said that but i get

429
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,399
off the call and my body

430
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
didn't feel that agreement the the

431
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,279
mirror neurons didn't fire the oxytocin

432
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,959
didn't flow through my blood

433
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,120
and i get off the call with you and i

434
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
don't my body doesn't say oh that's

435
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,800
because i'm using a low resolution

436
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,680
technology

437
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,079
no my body just says don't trust that

438
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:50,959
person they

439
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
say they agreed with you but they say

440
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,000
they agreed with me

441
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,880
but i didn't get the cues you know to

442
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,160
tell me that that's true

443
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,959
so that cognitive dissonance or physical

444
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,839
dissonance

445
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,720
actually creates distrust then the less

446
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,759
we trust each other

447
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,759
the more likely we are to make software

448
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,279
and and platforms

449
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,040
that manipulate other people because i

450
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
don't trust them anyway

451
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,839
and even the folks and you know i just

452
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,480
watched that

453
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,279
that ugh that netflix movie on the

454
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,639
social dilemma which is

455
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,320
you know all these white tech bros from

456
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,399
the worst places saying oh

457
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,839
i guess it was bad that i tried to

458
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,000
manipulate 11 year old girls with

459
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,560
uh you know behavioral algorithms ah i'm

460
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,240
kind of thinking twice about that

461
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,839
or oh i realize you know when i'm

462
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,279
manipulating millions of kids but i

463
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,440
don't let my own kids online at all

464
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
that maybe i have a double standard i

465
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,639
mean but

466
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,680
they they now they mean well right but

467
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,360
they still mean well through the lens of

468
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,920
uh of the tech bro it was through the

469
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,480
lens

470
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,079
of how do we use technology on people

471
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,600
rather than how can people use

472
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,839
technology so they know oh look

473
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,839
we use technology on people to make them

474
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,759
scared and bad and horrible

475
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,079
now could we use technology to make

476
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,199
people nice

477
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,919
by our definition of nice and that's

478
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,319
what

479
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,280
a lot of them are calling they're

480
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,000
calling it plan b right or game b

481
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,720
i think they call it game b is this idea

482
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,160
that we are going to

483
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,319
upgrade humans right instead of

484
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,679
downgrading us the way they've been

485
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,199
doing for the last 20 years now they

486
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
want to upgrade us

487
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,039
which again is that reversal of figure

488
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,199
and ground technology on people

489
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,679
social control how do we manipulate the

490
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,679
masses to be nicer just

491
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,000
leave us alone is what i'd say but this

492
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
is that kind of tech bro

493
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,760
techno solutionist solution set

494
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,919
and the reason why they have to use that

495
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,960
solution set

496
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,799
is because they're still and i don't

497
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,000
mean to sound too marxist

498
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,240
here but they're still capitalist they

499
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,600
still have their stock

500
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,080
in facebook and google they still want

501
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,039
to somehow

502
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,840
do good while still making money in this

503
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,360
old-fashioned way that's the

504
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,160
it's the classic neoliberal response to

505
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,960
a world

506
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,559
gone wrong and what they won't look at

507
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,039
is that there's an underlying operating

508
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:07,679
system

509
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,480
that they won't recognize it's not it's

510
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,039
not the

511
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,440
the the you know whether they're on on

512
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
on you know apache or

513
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,840
dos or linux or whatever it's the

514
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,360
underlying operating system

515
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,080
of exponential growth whatever idea they

516
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,480
have

517
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
they think how does this scale and

518
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,320
create

519
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,600
exponential growth and the reality is

520
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,120
and this is what i think that the crypto

521
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,880
anarchist realized in

522
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,960
in the 80s when i was still just just

523
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,280
learning about this stuff but it was my

524
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,520
my most open moment so i think that's

525
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,320
why i took it

526
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,559
took it in so deeply what they got was

527
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,480
that the proper use of technology the

528
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,320
appropriate use of technology

529
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,360
will actually slow down the growth

530
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
of the marketplace because these

531
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,440
technologies are distributive

532
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,160
and circulatory they're going to

533
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,440
engender

534
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,400
uh you know what we could call local

535
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,440
solutions

536
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,640
they they you know the the the crypto

537
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,919
anarchy to me

538
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,960
is is an anarcho-syndicalist solution

539
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,880
you know anarcho-syndicalism i i didn't

540
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,760
know what it was

541
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,640
but i had been um i'd been doing a talk

542
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,679
in uh

543
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,480
um germany and you know talking about

544
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,520
the internet

545
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,679
and and and everything i was interested

546
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,880
in and this

547
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,039
academic guy he was like one of these

548
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,880
guys they call like professor doctor you

549
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,240
know rather than just professor or

550
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,880
doctor

551
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,320
the professor doctor i'm professor

552
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,400
doctor or something and he kind of and

553
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,280
he said um

554
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,240
my my good sir i think you are an i

555
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,200
think you are

556
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
uh uh an anarcho-syndicalist

557
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
and i was like i don't know if you hum a

558
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,240
few bars you know i'll try to

559
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,039
tell you if i am um but so that night in

560
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,000
the hotel i

561
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
i looked up an arc of syndicalism on

562
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,360
wikipedia and i was like

563
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,320
oh yeah actually um this is a good thing

564
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
this is a good thing not a bad thing all

565
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,080
anarcho-cynicalism is is the idea that

566
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,200
you have

567
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,080
locally scaled cottage industries all

568
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,039
over the place

569
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,200
and they're networked and trading with

570
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,159
one another

571
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,960
and that that uh that you don't need the

572
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,000
sort of top-down

573
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,640
capitalist bank-driven uh uh you know

574
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
currency-driven

575
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,720
uh centralized economy that this uh

576
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,400
highly local economy with

577
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,880
with trading um almost like kibbutz's

578
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,000
with little trading

579
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,280
uh uh platform cooperatives will be a

580
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,159
a better solution and you know when when

581
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,080
i look at an arc of syndicalism

582
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,039
i see mechanisms that were repressed way

583
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,000
back in that same

584
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,159
moment that francis bacon was saying

585
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,840
that science should be the way we rape

586
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,400
nature

587
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,159
that's the same moment that we closed

588
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,440
the commons and

589
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,000
and turned it into uh you know chartered

590
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,880
monopolies

591
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,919
it's the same moment that we lost local

592
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:48,880
currencies

593
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,080
and moved towards you know dominant fiat

594
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,679
interest-based currencies that you had

595
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,120
to pay back money

596
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,720
you know it's the same moment that the

597
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,760
local business reality was replaced by

598
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,480
the large national chartered monopolies

599
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,240
and i feel like digital can retrieve

600
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,200
these medieval mechanisms not that we go

601
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,760
back

602
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,000
to medievalism but that we retrieve what

603
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,120
got repressed

604
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,880
during the renaissance with the

605
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,559
invention of the printing press and

606
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,120
and the industrial age so we retrieve

607
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,559
the comments and we've seen that some

608
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,080
with the creative commons and

609
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,280
commons based uh commons based uh

610
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,320
resource sharing we see it in the rise

611
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,640
of

612
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,400
of cryptocurrencies and local currencies

613
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,120
and even just uh peer-to-peer

614
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,240
authentication

615
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,159
once we do peer-to-peer authentication

616
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,679
we start to realize oh

617
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,520
we don't need the national central

618
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,919
government to somehow

619
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,039
verify that we've had a transaction

620
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,200
and we also get and this is what people

621
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,960
don't generally think about with the

622
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,640
internet with the internet we get a

623
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,360
reification of the local reality

624
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,440
television was the global medium

625
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,480
broadcasting

626
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,640
that moment the moon landing or the

627
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,919
olympics or the

628
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,400
felling of the berlin wall that's those

629
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
are television events they're global

630
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,799
events

631
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,280
the internet is actually highly local

632
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
and much of the activism we've seen

633
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,720
organized online has been you know

634
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,000
tareer square these are

635
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,280
these are local events even occupy is so

636
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,080
local and grounded in a local reality

637
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,640
and

638
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,440
my hope is that through digital tech we

639
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,159
can move

640
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,600
finally from a spectator

641
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,720
democracy run on television with the

642
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,440
values

643
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,799
of consumerism and consumer choice

644
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,840
just to a very different civics to a

645
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,559
civics

646
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,000
of distributed responsibility

647
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,080
which is what civics really is

648
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
individual responsibility for

649
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,720
all the others and that's what digital

650
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,840
can actually help

651
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,400
realize that i think we had such trouble

652
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,880
doing through radio and tv and broadcast

653
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,919
media that so

654
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,880
favors the the autocrat or the

655
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,039
authoritarian regime at the middle who

656
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,080
can broadcast

657
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,520
whether it's you know chairman mao

658
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
through all those thousands or

659
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
millions of radio speakers they put

660
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,280
through china or hitler through hitler

661
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,320
through radio or

662
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,760
trump through television he's not

663
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,679
actually a digital candidate this is a

664
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,000
television candidate it's another

665
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,200
discussion but i don't even look at

666
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,000
facebook

667
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
as digital i look at facebook as the

668
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,520
television model

669
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,360
on digital technology it's still a

670
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
surveillance and advertising model

671
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,000
on digital where that's not what digital

672
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,559
does

673
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,039
what digital does is create an

674
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:33,760
environment

675
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,960
with the potential for distributed

676
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,360
activity and distributed responsibility

677
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,799
that's kind of the original uh uh

678
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,440
dream of an anarchic world it's not

679
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,880
everybody out of control it's

680
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,440
everybody has authority and agency and

681
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,000
and

682
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,720
sovereignty and they they network

683
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,360
together

684
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,720
into temporary autonomous zones of

685
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,600
local uh local power and and value

686
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,279
exchange

687
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,000
so my hope and and this is why i was so

688
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,279
excited to see

689
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,840
this conference and the the people

690
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,559
listed

691
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,960
you know are such new ones and old ones

692
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,000
from this some of you know

693
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,320
some of us from you know eric raymond

694
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,600
and and people who

695
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
were writing about this in the early 90s

696
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,799
and late 80s

697
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,799
along with people who are actually doing

698
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,799
it in ways that people like me could

699
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
only imagine i can only really

700
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,159
you know when i look at what's happening

701
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
that look at the list of things

702
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,520
these are things that at this point all

703
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,279
i can do is cheerlead you know

704
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,159
cheerlead and pray for right because as

705
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:34,960
i see it

706
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,159
and i genuinely believe this that

707
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,039
we pushed the digital so far we pushed

708
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,120
capitalism or they the tech bros

709
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,640
so far in in the uh uh

710
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,080
no it wasn't a coincidence i said his

711
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,159
name i mean i said i'm i'm talking about

712
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,760
the names i saw there and went

713
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,240
oh my god this is it right we we're

714
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,520
we're reifying

715
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,200
crypto right we're reifying the

716
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
cathedral in the bazaar this

717
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,799
that these are these seminal thoughts

718
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,159
these are the ideas

719
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,919
that actually are are are

720
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,600
positive they're digital positive

721
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
instead of this crazy silicon valley

722
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,480
you know uh uh surveillance detour that

723
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,440
we've been on

724
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,559
so what my belief is is that we are we

725
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,200
are in

726
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,480
end stage digital industrialism

727
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,520
end stage digital capitalism and that

728
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,120
these guys pushed it so

729
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,760
far they push these technologies so far

730
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,880
so far west

731
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
what they didn't realize is what norbert

732
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,080
weiner told us

733
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,520
that that digital technology feeds back

734
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,240
digital technology is not linear it's

735
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,480
circular it's cybernetic it's going to

736
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,279
feed back

737
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,840
it collapses subject and object it

738
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,880
collapses

739
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,919
cause and effect it collapses uh uh

740
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,200
into karma if you will into yin yang

741
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
into circular into all of the eastern

742
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,320
dao

743
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
feedback mechanisms where everything you

744
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,520
do is realized

745
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,480
in the moment it retrieves regeneration

746
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,640
it retrieves

747
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,799
sustainability it retrieves life

748
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,760
you know and to me that's what crypto

749
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,559
anarchy

750
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,960
really is all about and that's why i i

751
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
came here hopefully

752
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,440
um to celebrate with you so maybe that's

753
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:15,919
enough

754
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,960
enough of a download from me

755
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,000
and we can uh we can engage using these

756
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,880
beautiful

757
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,840
uh technologies

758
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,760
amazing thank you so much so let me ask

759
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,679
the audience does anyone have any

760
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,360
questions or any topics that you'd like

761
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,000
to open up

762
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,480
there are two people let me jump over

763
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,799
this is this song right

764
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,880
yeah i can hear you can can you just

765
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,640
like okay i don't have to like to keep

766
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,480
my mask on or

767
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,200
you can hear me oh i'm safe i'm safe

768
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,919
here so i can

769
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,559
ride right right i get that but can you

770
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,440
see me or

771
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,760
or i mean should it be i can't say try

772
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,200
it though we could try putting the video

773
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,919
on it sounds

774
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,760
really cool um maybe you know so two

775
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,120
things i come from the same background

776
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
that you do

777
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,240
i'm a filmmaker not a theater director i

778
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
am incredibly disappointed

779
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,200
in art because actually new voices have

780
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,159
to leave

781
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,840
there there's nothing new happening you

782
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,000
have to go somewhere else to do that

783
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,360
so um i've also seen the social dilemma

784
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,320
i also feel uh in a similar way than you

785
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,720
do

786
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,039
when when you talked about the tech bros

787
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,880
and that they want to solve things

788
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,919
by relaying basically on capitalism how

789
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,919
can we make more money by being like

790
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,120
i don't know uh good people now so then

791
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,960
we get to jeremy rivkin

792
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,320
and the nearest zero marginal goal

793
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,919
society and the third industrial

794
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,399
revolution basically which is

795
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,039
capitalism in itself uh apparently

796
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,720
there's something about the way it works

797
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,919
that what it gets to

798
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,480
the optimum welfare basically technology

799
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,520
got so good

800
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,840
driven by the inherit the inherent like

801
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,679
spirit of entrepreneurialism

802
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,360
and getting to better prices and

803
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
everything and competition so basically

804
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,440
one technology is

805
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,279
as good as to let you not resort no no

806
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,039
no not to not have to resort

807
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,399
on the centralized authorities you get

808
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,080
to apparently you get to do your own

809
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,399
thing

810
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,960
so then we get to the sharing economy

811
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,520
and

812
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,039
the third industrial revolution and the

813
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,520
internet of things being a way to take

814
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,799
control

815
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,000
back like on ourselves and such

816
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,240
like how do you how do you look at the

817
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,279
sharing economy

818
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,760
and the near zero marginal gas society

819
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,039
not as a utopia

820
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,720
but as a thing that it's actually

821
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,120
working as uh capitalism

822
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,840
soon to be like the the search of profit

823
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,960
being defunct

824
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,039
in the name in the next like 30 years or

825
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,480
something mean

826
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,799
it's funny i read uh i've always liked

827
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,000
jeremy rifkin's work

828
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,200
but then i read the the zero margin cost

829
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,799
society you know which and and that book

830
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,840
along with uh george gilder wrote a book

831
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,880
about

832
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,720
something life after google or something

833
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,919
like that sort of

834
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,240
looking at the the difference between

835
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,919
these giant centralized

836
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,919
technology companies and the possibility

837
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,919
for in his book he was writing more

838
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,440
about the blockchain

839
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,640
and and and 3d printing and stuff

840
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,559
and somehow when when i read these books

841
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:32,880
i

842
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,240
feel like they're

843
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,440
they don't remember what it was like

844
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,600
when people when you would see dot

845
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,799
matrix printers

846
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,279
and daisy wheel printers on the curb in

847
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,240
the street

848
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,159
because now people got their laser jets

849
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,520
and then you'd see laser jets on the

850
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
street when people got their real laser

851
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,919
printers

852
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,960
that that there's so much trash

853
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,480
and so much cost it's like the

854
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,720
yes i can print something at home but

855
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,000
where does the goop

856
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,080
come from you know that i'm putting in

857
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,919
my printer and are there kids in the

858
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,480
congo going down into caves at gunpoint

859
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,440
to get this stuff so there's there's

860
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,240
this this

861
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,880
sort of zero marginal cost idea really

862
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,679
works

863
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,720
for digital products but i'm

864
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,960
i keep coming back to the this real

865
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,080
world

866
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,440
the the management of our soil you know

867
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
how it's turning into dirt and making us

868
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,679
dependent on monsanto to

869
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,159
teach us how to grow vegetables on dead

870
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:32,880
soil

871
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,360
or um uh the refugee crisis

872
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,399
from uh global warming and then the sort

873
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,720
of these optimistic visions of

874
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,240
you know uh a zero marginal cost

875
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,000
global economy start to look

876
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,919
uh special suspect to me uh you know on

877
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,440
on the other hand i feel like

878
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,120
you know these the the digital

879
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,799
technologies are so much

880
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,840
more they've always to me been so much

881
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,240
more

882
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,360
about modeling a behavior than actually

883
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,720
executing something so uh

884
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,039
you know when when we were first looking

885
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,600
at um at the internet as a social space

886
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,200
before the social media

887
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,320
came around and people were were

888
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,919
were thinking is this the new uh is this

889
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,000
the colonial being is this the way we

890
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,279
wire up

891
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,240
the the guy in mind you know and finally

892
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,000
behave as a single brain

893
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,880
and i would say no but i think it's the

894
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,240
way we practice

895
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,760
you know i think it's the way we

896
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,080
simulate what it will be like to have a

897
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,360
brain a global brain

898
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,519
but when we do it it's going to be just

899
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,880
our heads connected

900
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,720
you know our hearts connected to each

901
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,399
other as we'll realize

902
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,640
we're an organism and then we won't need

903
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,519
this net

904
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,679
to to be in in communion or in sync

905
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,840
with one another so i uh

906
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,640
very optimistic about these technologies

907
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,240
giving us the ability

908
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,640
to uh reinstate local economies

909
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,960
and then have those local economies be

910
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
in communication with each other

911
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,080
and model stuff with each other but

912
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,720
the the vision that i see in in in

913
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,279
rifkin

914
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,000
and gilder still feels like the vision

915
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,320
of people who were raised in the era of

916
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,440
globalism

917
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,080
looking at you know and global markets

918
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,600
and the wto

919
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,640
and all and uh that that is

920
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,919
um that is a vision that's

921
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,399
that's native to the television media

922
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,360
environment

923
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,919
and that the digital media environment

924
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,919
is going to look

925
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,120
uh is going to look different and i

926
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,480
i don't mean this in a bad way and i

927
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:50,799
love

928
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,360
crypto but i don't think cryptocurrency

929
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,440
is necessarily going to be a very big

930
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,679
part of it i think that cryptocurrency

931
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,080
currently and the blockchain currently

932
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,399
is still part of this dream to quantify

933
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,240
and quantize everything in reality

934
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,039
you know when i hear uh uh jaren lanier

935
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,880
who's smarter than me

936
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,200
like he is and probably more loving and

937
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,880
all that and maybe a nicer person

938
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,440
but when i hear him talk about oh we're

939
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,960
going to use blockchain to get

940
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,360
everything we do on the blockchain so

941
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,000
that we can

942
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,039
be properly compensated for it i i start

943
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,159
to imagine

944
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,880
you know okay if i normally get out of

945
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
bed on the left side of the bed

946
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,799
and occasionally get out on the right

947
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:35,919
side of the bed

948
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,399
that information might be useful to a

949
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,720
mattress company it might be valuable

950
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,080
to them and and so we could put a sensor

951
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,559
on my

952
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,960
on my you know internet of things in my

953
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
room that sees which

954
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,039
side i get off and i can get 0.02 cents

955
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:51,679
every time

956
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,000
i get out of bed on the other side or

957
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,840
every time i break my pattern

958
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,320
because that is now new information so

959
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,159
now i'm going to be waking up and

960
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,000
optimizing which side i get out of the

961
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,399
bed

962
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,320
in order to create the most valuable

963
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,000
data from the mattress company

964
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,480
that's observing me and it's like what's

965
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,440
going on is we're trying to you know

966
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,520
define and record more and more of human

967
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,560
experience but

968
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,960
the more we record the more we tend to

969
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,079
devalue

970
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,918
everything that we can't record

971
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,760
everything that's between those spaces

972
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,960
and to me

973
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,839
that's where life actually happens that

974
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:26,239
that

975
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,560
the most of these solutions are still

976
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,760
understanding

977
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,480
like they understand time with the ticks

978
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,440
of the clock

979
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,599
and they miss the space between the

980
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,159
ticks you know that's the great danger

981
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,159
of digital that we look at the ticks and

982
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,440
we miss the space

983
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,960
when life is actually happening so um

984
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,119
i mean that's a long-winded answer but i

985
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,040
think the solutions are much more simple

986
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,520
i think the i think that the majority of

987
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,399
our life

988
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,320
in a crypto anarchic or in a

989
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,079
narco-syndicalist reality

990
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,960
um ends up being people together playing

991
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,599
guitar

992
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,560
and farming and [ __ ] and teaching

993
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,359
kids

994
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,560
and then you know occasionally using um

995
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,079
digital technology to

996
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,960
um uh uh to network with the rest to

997
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,920
with the rest of the

998
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,400
of the planet well thank you for the

999
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,240
answer uh if i may just ask

1000
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,800
if you could come to the front a bit if

1001
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,320
you want to be seen on the live stream

1002
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,200
you can also go to the stage

1003
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,720
okay okay uh hello

1004
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,720
uh i would like to ask if you have any

1005
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,920
interesting resources about

1006
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,200
game b or if you perhaps can

1007
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,560
recommend another person who is

1008
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,079
who has something to say on this topic

1009
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,280
or if you maybe know a community that

1010
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,800
expresses some of the values and

1011
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,480
also do you think that game b is more

1012
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
is completely bottom up or do you think

1013
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,119
there are some top-down mechanisms

1014
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,640
that needs to be somehow

1015
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,400
incorporated before it's

1016
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,000
it's a possibility

1017
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,800
well i mean i don't have a lot of faith

1018
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,560
in the game b

1019
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,440
uh community as it were i mean i think

1020
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,640
that they mean well

1021
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,920
but they are you know mostly white tech

1022
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,680
bros who are like game designers

1023
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,040
you know and i feel like they look at

1024
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,119
the world a bit like simcity

1025
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,920
like okay we can program it this way um

1026
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,520
and there's this feeling that they still

1027
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,400
know better

1028
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,720
on the other hand you know and i speak

1029
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,599
to them a lot

1030
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,240
they a lot of what they say does also

1031
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,760
make sense you know

1032
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,800
the the the main folks doing it are

1033
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,440
there's a guy named jim rutt who was the

1034
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,520
ceo of the santa fe institute

1035
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,079
institute for a while and he was the ceo

1036
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,359
of network solutions

1037
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,079
for a while too um there's a guy named

1038
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,680
daniel schmacktenberger or

1039
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,880
schmecktenberg

1040
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,040
who on the one hand he kind of sells

1041
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,920
these um

1042
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,720
cognitive supplements and on the other

1043
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,079
is a kind of philosopher

1044
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,119
about getting humanity to the next place

1045
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,079
um uh tristan harris is involved in that

1046
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,320
and the center for humane technology

1047
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,680
so those are our good trail heads um for

1048
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,280
for this for the game b thing i just

1049
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,800
um i don't know

1050
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,839
i i when i when i engage with them

1051
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,000
i see their good intention but i always

1052
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,520
feel like they're being

1053
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,359
a little bit or a lot too prescriptive

1054
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,359
and we know better and here's the

1055
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,359
blueprint for the next civilization it's

1056
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:41,760
like

1057
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,280
no wait a minute you're the guys that

1058
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,040
[ __ ] up this civilization and now

1059
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,560
we're supposed to trust you

1060
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,359
to build the next one i feel like it's

1061
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,960
something that doesn't even happen

1062
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,680
that intentionally that architecturally

1063
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,760
that there is no master plan

1064
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,040
for a crypto anarchic universe right

1065
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,119
that's part of the point there's no

1066
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,240
master plan

1067
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,760
there's the distributed uh uh emergent

1068
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,880
uh uh reality and the more we can the

1069
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,599
more we can

1070
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,800
uh uh tolerate living in the real world

1071
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,839
um the more that these uh uh the more

1072
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:16,240
that the

1073
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,359
the necessary patterns will uh you know

1074
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,560
kind of foster themselves

1075
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,280
even okay

1076
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,560
we've been missing each other several

1077
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,720
times already uh i love your critique of

1078
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,280
the game b

1079
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,800
guys because they're best friends with

1080
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,400
me in america as well so

1081
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,640
concept of that but what i wanted to

1082
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,320
point out is that uh i

1083
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,599
hate the sort of platonist

1084
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,320
urban planning attitude that i think

1085
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,920
drives the game b movement and i

1086
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,560
completely

1087
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,400
share your sympathy in that case and

1088
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,680
actually i think it's dangerous it's

1089
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,560
outside danger

1090
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
outright dangerous and and the fact that

1091
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,720
it plays into the virtual signaling

1092
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,960
of all culture at the moment as well

1093
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,720
it's a really bad combo

1094
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,640
and that's obviously real the algorithm

1095
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,000
design is going to go it's like scary

1096
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
already when you do google search today

1097
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
it's not the algorithms are not honest

1098
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
to you any longer the algorithms are

1099
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,240
really there to

1100
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,000
nudge you they love this verb to nudge

1101
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,359
you and send you in a certain direction

1102
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:17,760
yeah

1103
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,240
you get the doubles but if i sort of

1104
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,440
turn

1105
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,960
the bigger picture to the critique

1106
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,000
towards your vision if i sort of um

1107
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,839
be straightforward and call your vision

1108
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,040
digital hinduism

1109
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,880
you know they were all going to play

1110
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,400
around little communes everywhere and

1111
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,839
it's all gonna be fun and at the end of

1112
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,440
the day i think the tragedy though is

1113
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,599
that this is a very global thing anyway

1114
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,119
and with netflix and stuff like that

1115
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,520
coming around as a more sound response

1116
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,960
to facebook when we hated talking to

1117
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,920
each other on facebook

1118
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,440
and we're just trolling each other and

1119
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,920
netflix actually came along with winners

1120
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,880
takes all formulas in terms of talent

1121
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,960
talented scripted series with talented

1122
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,440
actors

1123
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,119
talented stories that actually touched

1124
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,800
people and it became a global mass

1125
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,760
phenomenon

1126
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,240
and and i wonder where in your model are

1127
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,560
you gonna do the storytelling to for

1128
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,839
example young men

1129
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,480
who are looking for an exodus or a dream

1130
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,720
that we say utopia in response to the

1131
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,160
current lynch mobs that are

1132
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,599
actually plaguing the internet at the

1133
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,440
moment because my skepticism towards

1134
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,720
your digital hinduism

1135
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,800
is that it's pagan and if it's pagan

1136
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,319
it's gonna be fellow lunch mobs rather

1137
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,760
than all those little clever little

1138
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,560
villages and

1139
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,760
you know what everybody's playing along

1140
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,200
with you portrayed i don't think we're

1141
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,640
gonna sit and play guitars with each

1142
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,000
other actually i think the real skit

1143
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,760
what scares the [ __ ] out of me is that

1144
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,119
a flat universe flat internet today is

1145
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,680
gonna be a lot more about lynch mobs

1146
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,200
and scapegoats and it's going to be

1147
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,800
about people playing guitars to one

1148
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
another

1149
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,760
can you can you see connection if i ask

1150
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,880
you towards some kind of exodus

1151
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,119
or an exodus myth or something like that

1152
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,280
that ties into something more utopian

1153
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,599
in response to the game b guys so we can

1154
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,359
sort of pull the rug underneath them

1155
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,680
with something better than what they do

1156
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,280
but it's not just guitar playing in

1157
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,920
communities

1158
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,440
you see what i mean yeah yeah i mean

1159
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:03,920
that's why

1160
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,599
you know uh i mean in some ways my

1161
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,119
my judaism is so embedded

1162
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,680
in my world view maybe too much that i

1163
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,560
kind of take that

1164
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,640
i take that aspect for granted because

1165
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,839
it's so ingrained

1166
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,880
you know that that i i'm

1167
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,880
i mean i'm not like a monotheist like

1168
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,079
that but the

1169
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,480
the you know the idea of the law and an

1170
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,440
ethic and i'm from this very patriarchal

1171
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,560
tradition so i guess i always err on the

1172
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,119
side

1173
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,920
of just tearing that all down when

1174
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,760
that's not actually what i would mean

1175
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,920
i mean when i talk about civics as

1176
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,200
responsibility

1177
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,359
i mean that really in pretty stark

1178
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,440
contrast to you know what we might call

1179
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,400
friendship civics or hippie civics that

1180
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,960
having responsibility means

1181
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,720
experiencing responsibilities for the

1182
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,400
people we hate not just the people we

1183
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,040
like

1184
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,760
you know the the rodney king why can't

1185
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,440
we all just get along

1186
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,720
oprah winfrey hands across the world uh

1187
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,640
political reality is is

1188
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,640
crap right that won't that won't work

1189
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,480
either the object of the game is not

1190
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,160
to like each other the object of the

1191
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,760
game is not to kill each other

1192
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,200
um so you're right and i i think that

1193
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,599
you know as i look at uh and i've got

1194
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,560
friends working in

1195
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,280
um in uh uh online radicalization

1196
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,480
and and how that happens and a lot of it

1197
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,760
seems to be

1198
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,280
um guys in their teens and early 20s

1199
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,640
want a potent male

1200
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,240
role model they want a non-castrated

1201
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,040
male

1202
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,440
role model and that's part of what makes

1203
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,160
them fall

1204
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,440
into you know the alt-right or isis

1205
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,760
or you know whichever radicalized group

1206
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,880
is going to provide

1207
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,359
even i mean god knows you know what but

1208
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,319
but trump

1209
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,599
uh it gives them the the illusion of the

1210
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,359
male who hasn't been castrated who

1211
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,319
refuses

1212
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,800
not to say whatever he wants and to grab

1213
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
whatever [ __ ] he wants and all that

1214
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,920
and that um activates them so you know

1215
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,520
what we need instead

1216
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,000
is some kind of a a replacement for and

1217
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,440
a reification of the the true male

1218
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,760
you know uh you know and and not to get

1219
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,599
hindu on you but some real yoni and

1220
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,160
lingam

1221
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,200
you know understanding here you know uh

1222
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,240
uh tantric practice maybe um but

1223
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:26,960
something that

1224
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,440
that somehow acknowledges that and yeah

1225
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,480
and and

1226
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,000
if we can do it as an acknowledged

1227
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,520
social construction then of course we

1228
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,240
need hierarchies we can't make it flat

1229
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,119
of course we do hierarchies but you know

1230
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,000
that was the whole

1231
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,720
joke in in torah not to get jewish on

1232
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,800
you but in torah as opposed to hinduism

1233
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,760
you know samuel is the prophet and and

1234
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,599
the people keep the israelites keep

1235
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,319
saying

1236
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,079
look we want um we want a king

1237
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,920
we want a king and samuel keeps talking

1238
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,280
to god and says what do i do they want a

1239
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:01,839
king

1240
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,599
and god keeps saying just tell them they

1241
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,280
don't need a king a king of stupid you

1242
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,240
don't want a king

1243
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
and samuel says no but they're insisting

1244
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,520
they really want a king

1245
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,480
so god tells samuel says all right go

1246
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,240
pick the tallest guy

1247
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,040
you know and he said that as if to say i

1248
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,160
think as if to say

1249
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,480
it's completely arbitrary who you pick

1250
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,359
as king

1251
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,119
make it a social construction put the

1252
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,800
crown on the guy so whoever's got the

1253
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,920
crown is the

1254
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,760
king right they're not the king they're

1255
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,720
the king so if we could play that way

1256
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,680
with social hierarchy i think we end up

1257
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,359
in a much better place

1258
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,720
than you know with people who have a

1259
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,400
billion dollars actually

1260
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,520
um being essentially better off

1261
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,839
in this world um than people who don't

1262
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,599
get it you know in this survival of the

1263
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,119
fittest dog eat dog

1264
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,000
um you know game of competitive

1265
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,880
capitalism

1266
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,839
which is justifying itself on bad

1267
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,520
evolutionary science

1268
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,119
um but that doesn't mean there's still

1269
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,280
not some competition that there's still

1270
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,680
some hierarchy in this it's just as

1271
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,599
conscious human beings we have to learn

1272
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,480
to mitigate as many of the of the

1273
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,520
downsides

1274
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,359
of competitive uh of a competitive world

1275
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,040
you know with um you know some some

1276
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,359
uh uh at least cooperation at least

1277
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,280
civic responsibility even if

1278
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,800
you know i hate that guy over there

1279
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,720
who's got the the pizzeria that's

1280
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,839
competing with mine

1281
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,440
you know but i agree with you a lot of

1282
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,200
what i said today can sound

1283
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,880
particularly where i'm coming from right

1284
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,280
now in trump land

1285
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,400
i'm probably airing a bit on the side

1286
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,839
of um this almost eastern

1287
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,760
style you know non-hierarchical

1288
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,200
you know landscape of cybernetic loops

1289
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,560
um you know and and negating the fact

1290
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,240
that even a fractal

1291
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,359
will create a shape you know even a

1292
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,079
fractal

1293
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,480
will have what could be understood as as

1294
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,760
hierarchies it's not

1295
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,400
just no it's not just you know ping pong

1296
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,520
balls on a flat

1297
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,920
on a flat landscape so i agree with you

1298
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,880
there

1299
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,280
thank you uh there is one last question

1300
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,240
because we are

1301
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,960
at our time from the chat uh douglas

1302
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,960
what was your project at the institute

1303
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,160
for the feature uh not sure what

1304
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,160
um well it's interesting i wrote a book

1305
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,319
in 1993

1306
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,000
i guess uh four called media virus

1307
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,400
which kind of launched the viral the the

1308
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,319
language around viral media

1309
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:33,520
and uh they

1310
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,119
were doing you know it was after trump

1311
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,560
was elected and

1312
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,720
and the breakdown of all the social

1313
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,720
media networks and everybody realizing

1314
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,119
about you know the danger of weaponized

1315
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,160
mimetics

1316
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,280
and they wanted me to do a report

1317
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,319
on you know what to do about

1318
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,800
uh you know kind of weaponized mimetics

1319
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,839
and

1320
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,400
uh you know what the work that i did and

1321
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,319
it was based on what i was thinking

1322
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,119
back then is that it's not about trying

1323
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,040
to develop technologies that somehow

1324
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,720
filter the memes although

1325
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,800
it's a nice idea that the real thing we

1326
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,839
have to do it

1327
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,480
just like anybody being attacked by a

1328
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,000
virus the thing we have to work on

1329
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,760
is our collective cultural immune

1330
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,839
response how do we have

1331
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,599
a positive immune response how do we

1332
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,839
learn to recognize dangerous memetic

1333
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:20,640
structures

1334
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,960
so that they don't replicate so that we

1335
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,720
don't spread them how do you strengthen

1336
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,319
your immune system do you do it

1337
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,359
with homeopathic doses of uh

1338
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,800
of dangerous memes or do you do it by by

1339
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,079
um i think by having a good public

1340
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,040
conversation

1341
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,240
about the kinds of issues that memes are

1342
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,880
meant

1343
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,119
to trigger you know because this a media

1344
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,480
virus won't spread

1345
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,400
unless it's triggering some unresolved

1346
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,359
cultural issue about race or gender or

1347
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:52,640
economics or

1348
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,960
sex or something it means that there's

1349
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,400
something that we're not talking about

1350
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,680
that we need to

1351
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,920
um so that was sort of that was sort of

1352
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,960
the gist of it not to take

1353
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
responsibility away from the platforms

1354
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,839
for

1355
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,440
monitoring activity rather than just

1356
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,839
making money off of horror

1357
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,480
um but that that what we have to look at

1358
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,119
is

1359
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,079
uh sort of our our education and social

1360
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,000
reality in order to create

1361
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,040
a more uh a a better

1362
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,079
uh cultural and cognitive uh immune

1363
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,960

1364
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,680
