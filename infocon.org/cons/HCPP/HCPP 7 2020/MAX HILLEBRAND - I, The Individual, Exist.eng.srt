1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,440
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:05,839
so

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,160
uh today uh talking about some

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,960
philosophy

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,240
right because i think that is so

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,080
important uh in in general

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
uh and specifically in crypto anarchy uh

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,759
because crypto anarchy is a very strong

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,039
philosophy based on

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,760
sound and solid first principles and i

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,039
think that's why it's so

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,279
interesting to analyze this a bit more

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,480
and to explore here

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,000
um so in in general i

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,599
want to make make two cases here first

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,439
is one for a methodological approach

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,760
right which is practicology right

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,840
starting based on first principles

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,079
and then elaborating logically on top

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,520
and then second i want to explore

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,320
actually what is

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,399
what is what is manifesting here based

23
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,640
on what in first principle we choose and

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,000
what logically follows

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,480
specifically in the light of privacy as

26
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,760
this is so important

27
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,920
uh for us of course the cypherpunks and

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,199
crypto anarchists

29
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,600
um so that's that's why i want to start

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
with with the the first principles right

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,800
this is so important

32
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,640
um first of all why do i think that

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,160
these first principles are a

34
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
meaningful or a useful strategy to

35
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,600
pursue

36
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,960
and and that basically is because

37
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,479
there's an uh an understanding or

38
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,680
realization that

39
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,760
i don't know right there's so much

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,360
uncertainty there's so many unknown

41
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,159
unknowns

42
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,720
um and there are countless things that i

43
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,920
that i have to assume

44
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,880
to be correct or to be false right um

45
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,799
but i cannot logically prove it

46
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,640
and this is very very important to

47
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
understand what you actually do not know

48
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,759
what you cannot prove

49
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,799
and a assumption a first principle for

50
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,079
example in geometry

51
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,479
two parallel lines never meet that's an

52
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,200
assumption

53
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,720
we don't we can't really prove it

54
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,479
however when we assume this

55
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,720
we can build logically on top uh to a

56
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,759
quite monumental

57
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,799
and beautifully complex architect and

58
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,840
structure

59
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,680
and this is why i think this is such a

60
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
important methodological approach it

61
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,880
really

62
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,439
it gives you a strong foundation to to

63
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,360
stand on and to build upon but it's also

64
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,159
so important

65
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,640
to continuously check back and verify on

66
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,000
these first principles

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
because if they are flawed right if

68
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,119
you're building your house on sand if

69
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,399
you're if these assumptions are

70
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,040
ludicrous and are not reasonable to make

71
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,680
then

72
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,280
all the logical construct that is built

73
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,959
on top will fall into pieces

74
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,440
and crumble to ashes and however

75
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
contrarily if that first principle is

76
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,840
solid

77
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,040
and actually verified then we can

78
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,599
we can really rely on the results that

79
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,200
we receive

80
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,440
and this is why i'm such a huge fan of

81
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,800
this praxiological approach

82
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
it's extremely solid and it took me a

83
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,000
couple years to

84
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
not just define these first principles

85
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,120
but also to refine them

86
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
and to fine-tune them and to see if

87
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,640
there are deeper assumptions that can be

88
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,120
made

89
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,519
uh to still uphold this uh logical

90
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,160
construct

91
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
on top um and and today i want to make

92
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,360
that case

93
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,920
uh that the one important assumption

94
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
something that i cannot prove but

95
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
something that i think is

96
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,560
super meaningful and useful to assume to

97
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,519
be correct

98
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,959
is that i the individual exists and that

99
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,159
there is a individual core that i am

100
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,959
that i manifest uh that i am here in the

101
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,840
here and now

102
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
observing right i am that observer that

103
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
out of a hyper position

104
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,519
makes the binary fades right in this in

105
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,840
this vast pool of uncertainties and

106
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,959
and falsehoods and inaccuracies

107
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,879
i exist as a strong fundamental pillar

108
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,440
and this doesn't have to be assumed um

109
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,959
there's there's an entire branch of

110
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:23,760
collectivism

111
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,000
and that exhumes exactly the opposite

112
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,519
that the individual does not exist but

113
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,280
rather a construct of in of

114
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,040
of multiple pieces coming together as a

115
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,799
collective and that this collect

116
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,840
collective exists and shapes and acts uh

117
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,599
and i think this uh this is quite a

118
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,200
ludicrous assumption and the logical

119
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
consequences from that

120
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,239
i think are quite drastic unfortunately

121
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,400
not much time to talk into his uh today

122
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
because i want to focus on what we

123
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
actually can build when we assume

124
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,040
that individuals exist um because that

125
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,000
that fundamentally means that there is a

126
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,720
a a

127
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,239
concept of scarcity of exclusivity

128
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,640
right that there is one individual who

129
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,400
who occupies one space

130
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,200
in time uh and this this space or this

131
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,680
body

132
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
is exclusively controlled by one

133
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,200
individual not by another

134
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,959
right um i i act i i move my body

135
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,680
i speak and this is me doing it it is

136
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,478
not you

137
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,000
you do not control me you do not enforce

138
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
me to act in a certain way but this is

139
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,120
my free choice

140
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
to allocate my own scarcity my own body

141
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,880
that exclusive resource that that i uh

142
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,400
receive as an individual

143
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
um we never say that i am my body but

144
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,800
that i have a body

145
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,280
right uh this this bodily form is a

146
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,000
resource

147
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,919
a scarce resource that i have exclusive

148
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,919
control over whom i have property rights

149
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,639
in

150
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,440
and and this is what i uh can allocate

151
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,320
throughout time

152
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
but again scarcity is an aspect of

153
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,440
rivalry of potential um conflict that

154
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,880
might arise over the question

155
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,440
who actually controls a scarce resource

156
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,919
that only one individual can control

157
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,360
and this is where that aspect

158
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,639
of uneasiness of suffering comes in

159
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,919
um there is only a limited uh a

160
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,600
and an exclusive quantity of scarce

161
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,039
resources available

162
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,960
and i have a bunch of problems and i

163
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
want these problems to be fixed

164
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,960
right but there are there are hindrances

165
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
in this right i'm hungry

166
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,479
and i need to do something about this i

167
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,600
need to act

168
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,440
because i am in a current state of

169
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
uneasiness i have a problem

170
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,160
and this is what i want to solve and and

171
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
this is a the state of suffering that

172
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,440
the individual is in

173
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,039
um being uncomfortable uh and and

174
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,080
well in a problem though the genius and

175
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,360
creative spark

176
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
that the individual entrepreneur has is

177
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,720
to

178
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,360
imagine a potentially superior state

179
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,639
right to imagine

180
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,880
that there exists something that will

181
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
fix my problems

182
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,320
right that i can manifest to improve my

183
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,120
situation

184
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
uh from what it is now uh to what is it

185
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,720
what it will be in the future

186
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,800
um and and this is basically the

187
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,080
entrepreneur

188
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,400
venturing out into a huge pool of

189
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,199
darkness

190
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,240
uh and uneasiness and uncertainty and

191
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,639
there is so much potential meaning

192
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,319
endless amounts of different options

193
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
that the individual can choose

194
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,960
what to pursue and of course with more

195
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
creativity comes more options

196
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,000
comes more potential potentialities that

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,520
could be manifested and the aspect of

198
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,199
of choice is to prioritize these

199
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,360
to find out the most important the most

200
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,120
meaningful the most valuable

201
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,800
task that they can that the individual

202
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,160
can do right now

203
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
that where he can allocate his scarce

204
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
time his scarce resources

205
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,360
to manifest the most delightful and most

206
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,560
meaningful

207
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,520
way and this is choice this is a

208
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,160
obliteration of everything but one

209
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,720
we burn all the other opportunities that

210
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,000
we have to the ground

211
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,039
uh and we only act on one

212
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,520
and this is what is the marginal

213
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,479
preference

214
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,000
and which which is verified or shown

215
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
in human action and me speaking right

216
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,599
here right now on stage

217
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,680
is a proof that there's absolutely

218
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,599
nothing more meaningful for me to do

219
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,160
than be right here and talk to you right

220
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,599
and that is that is a

221
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,919
gigantic compliment basically to you all

222
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,120
because i think that you are that

223
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,039
important individuals to talk to

224
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,960
that i have assumed before me walking on

225
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,240
stage that after

226
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,560
me giving this talk i'm better off than

227
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,280
before

228
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,599
right and there were plenty of other

229
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,800
things i could be outside

230
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,680
right uh and talking to others but this

231
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,599
is not what what i deemed for myself to

232
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,960
be the most meaningful the most

233
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,039
important the most urgent thing to do

234
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,280
um and i've obliterated all of these

235
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,080
other things

236
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,639
um which which is again a huge suffering

237
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,240
right this is a huge opportunity

238
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
cost all of the other things that i

239
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,000
could have done a plentitude

240
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,199
a plentitude and it is a sacrifice

241
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,120
to actually decide on what to do and

242
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,560
that's why it's so difficult

243
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,039
to to to decide and to take action

244
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,479
because there's such a huge cost

245
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,120
involved

246
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
of of shrinking down this gigantic pool

247
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,199
of darkness

248
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,319
into one concrete uh point uh in in

249
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,360
in action and in time and here is also

250
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,759
where

251
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,759
that aspect of time comes in right

252
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,800
there's there's a

253
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,680
a past which is um the the uneasiness

254
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,800
that the individual

255
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,039
has felt in the past and a current point

256
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,240
where he is in right now

257
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,919
where he realizes that he's suffering

258
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,520
that there are problems uh

259
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,360
and he has that creative spark to come

260
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
up with a better future to think of

261
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,919
solutions

262
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,400
right and then finally to act and that

263
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,440
is to manifest

264
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,799
change right to fix the problem uh to

265
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,519
to do the work uh and this is the aspect

266
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,200
of progress

267
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,240
of advancement of time right there's a

268
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,519
point before the action

269
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,360
and after the action and that change of

270
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
the state uh that is

271
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,080
time and therefore it also comes in into

272
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,959
time preference

273
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,279
right i would prefer to have my problems

274
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,320
fixed sooner

275
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,399
rather than later right because my time

276
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,080
is again one of the scarce resources

277
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,120
that i use

278
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,800
and it is exclusive in the sense that i

279
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
can only allocate my time to one certain

280
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
task at one certain point

281
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
and and therefore the question of of

282
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,160
resource allocation

283
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
is is incredibly important what do you

284
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
actually do with the capital that you

285
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,160
have

286
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
with the goods that you control with the

287
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
natural resources

288
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,519
with your bodily form of your time with

289
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,360
your attention with your energy

290
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,160
and here again that aspect of a vast

291
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,040
opportunity

292
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
uh and obliterating all but one to then

293
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,959
manifest in the action

294
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,880
um is resource allocation and that is

295
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
the the core archetype of the

296
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,519
entrepreneur

297
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,920
right to discover what a problem is not

298
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,080
just now but also in the future right

299
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,800
to anticipate future problems and then

300
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,200
already to anticipate future solutions

301
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,959
to these very difficult problems and

302
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,399
then to actually do it

303
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,880
not just to talk about it but to act and

304
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,440
i think

305
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,000
this is the this is the heroic

306
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,839
entrepreneurial archetype that i love so

307
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,120
much

308
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,760
though very interesting to see is that

309
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,440
up until this point

310
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,480
i'm talking about a private individual

311
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,120
a isolated individual an individual who

312
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,079
has not revealed

313
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,720
himself to other individuals um he is

314
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,519
anonymous

315
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,079
so to say he is on his own nobody can

316
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:10,880
attribute

317
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
uh or nobody can orient that he even

318
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,640
exists and nobody can attribute certain

319
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,279
actions

320
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,200
to this individual because he has not

321
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
yet revealed himself he has not yet

322
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,079
engaged in interaction not just to act

323
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,040
by himself

324
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
but to act in accordance with another

325
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,079
individual

326
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,079
and to receive that feedback of the

327
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,320
reaction of this other individual

328
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,720
right so the entire concept that uh that

329
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,240
we've built up until now

330
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
is solid for the isolated individual

331
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,160
where we assume nothing else

332
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,720
but that one individual exists um and

333
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,920
and this is i think quite a

334
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,720
profound um logical achievement already

335
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,880
in in just this this short of time

336
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
but of course it goes much much further

337
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,720
um in in many many circumstances the

338
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,920
individual is not

339
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,040
isolated right um there is a choice

340
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
for the individual to selectively reveal

341
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
himself to others

342
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
for example right now i choose to reveal

343
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
myself to all the people in this room

344
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
and everyone walking in as well as all

345
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,360
the people in cyber space watching

346
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,279
but this is a choice for me right i

347
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,440
would i did not have to come on stage

348
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,519
it was one of the many many potentials

349
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,800
that i could choose from

350
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,040
but it was the one that i deemed for

351
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,560
myself to be the most delightful the

352
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,440
most meaningful

353
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,839
and that is why i have revealed myself

354
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,959
um

355
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,160
and this has multiple consequences

356
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,040
first and foremost that um that i am

357
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
being observed that you guys see me

358
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,680
right and i see you uh this means that

359
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,160
there is

360
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,720
again a potential for conflict because

361
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
we are in the realm of scarcity

362
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
meaning any scarce good can only be

363
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
controlled by one individual

364
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
and now if there are many individuals

365
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,279
the scarce resource for example of my

366
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,839
body

367
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,680
is very much in a potential danger

368
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,880
because what happens when all of you

369
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
decide that this is a juicy piece of

370
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,079
meat that you would love to eat

371
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,959
right then i'm in serious trouble and i

372
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,000
would not be in that risk

373
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,279
if you weren't there if you would not

374
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,639
observe me right if i would not have

375
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,079
revealed myself to this

376
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,720
to you and to this world um so that that

377
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,839
aspect of

378
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,240
um privacy is in a sense security

379
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,880
because it

380
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,959
it removes that potential that other

381
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,480
individuals

382
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,079
will will mess with your scarce

383
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,079
resources with your property

384
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,720
and this is one of the major downsides

385
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,000
of revealing yourself

386
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,079
if nobody knows that you exist nobody

387
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,360
can steal from you

388
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
nobody knows how much money you have

389
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,959
then they don't know if it's worth to

390
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,240
steal from you

391
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
and to go through all the trouble so to

392
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,440
be a private

393
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,240
individual an isolated individual means

394
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,680
that on the benefit side

395
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,800
um that that scarcity can be and

396
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,120
the the according ownership and property

397
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,000
rights in it

398
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,399
um is defined by the individual and

399
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,920
verified and enforced

400
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,320
by the by the individual right uh if

401
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,480
there is nobody else to make a claim

402
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
on your property nobody else trying to

403
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,680
take what is yours

404
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,839
then you are sovereign and you're

405
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,079
defendable and and you actually are free

406
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,519
and nobody messes with the things that

407
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,440
you have um and and that's

408
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,240
quite an a good achievement but there

409
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,839
are many many downsides to it

410
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,000
right because of all monkeys are kind of

411
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,360
nice right

412
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
and monkeys are social creatures and to

413
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,560
hang around to others

414
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
is in general interesting and i think

415
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,600
one of the reasons

416
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
is because it it enables a feedback loop

417
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,959
right when i not just act by myself but

418
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,320
interact with others

419
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,040
then my actions have obviously in all in

420
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,839
any situation

421
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,680
uh consequences uh and these

422
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,760
consequences i can observe again

423
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,680
right i can observe your reaction or you

424
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
look um how you tilt your head

425
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,720
how you react to what i speak and i can

426
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,000
take on this feedback

427
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,320
uh and and observe it uh and orient

428
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,079
myself in accordance to

429
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,639
to you and to your reaction and i can

430
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,760
better understand

431
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,199
of what is going on currently in that

432
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,120
situation i get a new feedback

433
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,360
right uh that is incredibly useful

434
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
because it it shows me if i'm if i'm

435
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,920
correct or wrong

436
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
right if i say a stupid statement and

437
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
you all shake your head vehemently and

438
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,519
disagree with me loudly

439
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,560
well then i might reconsider my my uh my

440
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,680
thoughts on that subject

441
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,600
right then i can i will advance my

442
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,959
understanding of it further

443
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,480
based on that feedback that i got from

444
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,720
externally that knowledge that i took in

445
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
from the outside realm um but

446
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
nevertheless that understanding

447
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,040
is always internal uh always internal

448
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,959
you can never make me understand

449
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,120
something that i don't um you can

450
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,959
package information nicely and present

451
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,720
it to me in an adequate form

452
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,639
that might help me to understand but

453
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,839
fundamentally that

454
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,240
that reaching a conclusion to make that

455
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
prioritization of your values

456
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,079
and to find out what exactly you want to

457
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,639
do that is always an internal act

458
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,680
um and an internal process and and

459
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,560
finally

460
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
the question is do you act actually do

461
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,480
you align your thoughts and your actions

462
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,320
to what you have discovered to be true

463
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,079
right and this is again where feedback

464
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:46,800
from others

465
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,279
is so so so valuable because if i don't

466
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,399
get that feedback and i'm

467
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,240
in a completely wrong rabbit hole um

468
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,680
then i'm gonna have the problem that i'm

469
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,880
never gonna discover

470
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,639
that i'm actually on the wrong track and

471
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,760
i will continue and continue and

472
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
continue down that wrong rabbit hole

473
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,279
wasting a bunch of my scarce resources

474
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,959
my time and attention

475
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,800
and therefore getting that feedback

476
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,959
early is very very valuable for me again

477
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,320
to be more productive in

478
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,279
in my resource allocation so that aspect

479
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,000
of of being

480
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,560
a revealed individual right uh not a

481
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,480
private not an anonymous individual but

482
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,519
but gathering that

483
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,519
that feedback that reputation is very

484
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,800
very useful

485
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,440
um and of course further monkeys can do

486
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,000
stuff

487
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
right monkeys can act they can fix

488
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,360
problems and

489
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,839
the the very nice thing is that when

490
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
others fix a problem for me

491
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,079
i don't have to fix it right so that's

492
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,279
very very useful

493
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,759
um this means that i can solve more

494
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,480
problems

495
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
if others help me right if i interact

496
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,680
with others

497
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,600
and now the question is how do you

498
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,720
interact

499
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,920
and i would say that there are two

500
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,759
fundamentally opposed

501
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,560
and and completely and tathagonal ways

502
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,320
of collaborating

503
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,720
one is the economic means based on

504
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,160
voluntary interaction

505
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,399
where both sides of the party of the

506
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,639
trait um can make their own free

507
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,600
priorities

508
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,839
of how they would like to act all these

509
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,199
potentials

510
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,920
they are going to to prefer precisely to

511
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,959
according to their will

512
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,480
and they will choose whichever is most

513
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,639
profitable for them and as long as both

514
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,160
parties do this as long as it is

515
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,560
mutually beneficial and that is the

516
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
entrepreneurial the economic mean the

517
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,440
productive mean

518
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,920
where value is created on both sides

519
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,639
right

520
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,279
when when a trade happens both sides are

521
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,639
better off than they were before

522
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,839
otherwise they would not have made the

523
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,480
trade uh and and that aspect of creating

524
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,360
value of

525
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,279
of manifesting something beautiful and

526
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,600
delightful that is economics

527
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,040
that is entrepreneurship um and this is

528
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
this is one beautiful aspect to work

529
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,160
together

530
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,120
the other is where there is no um

531
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,600
freedom

532
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
in how to prioritize and no freedom in

533
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
which of these options to choose

534
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,880
so someone else estimates what your

535
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,639
subjective valuations of all the

536
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,160
potential scenarios are

537
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,639
and someone else not you makes that

538
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,279
choice

539
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,519
on how to allocate these scarce

540
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,440
resources that is your body your time

541
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,400
your capital

542
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,799
uh all of these um and and this

543
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,919
fundamentally where

544
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,480
an outside individual makes that choice

545
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,359
above another

546
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,160
individual that is theft that is tyranny

547
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,520
uh that is

548
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,880
well just not efficient basically

549
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
by definition again because the other

550
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,240
party did not

551
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,359
consensually agree uh to this uh and the

552
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,880
the main downside

553
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,360
to this then is that he does not show he

554
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,320
does not prove

555
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
that there was value created he frankly

556
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,440
did not really want

557
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,360
to have that other good uh and service

558
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,799
that the other party offered

559
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,679
um but he was forced to accept it right

560
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,960
so there were there is no

561
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,280
proof no no showcase that value was

562
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,000
created

563
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,080
quite contrary before because there was

564
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,760
no free choice involved

565
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,480
um the value has been destroyed uh

566
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,200
provably

567
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
in every case one party has a benefit

568
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,559
the thief

569
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,280
and one party is suffering the victim

570
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,039
and that is an inherent case

571
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,799
all the times every time when we talk

572
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,799
about politics it is completely

573
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,840
antithetical

574
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
to freedom to individuality uh to

575
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,360
prosperity

576
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,679
uh to that aspect of creating that that

577
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,200
courageous act

578
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,240
to fix problems it is actively a a

579
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,160
work against that and in the complete

580
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,080
antithesis

581
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,880
and again this is where that aspect of

582
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,160
privacy comes in

583
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
because when you are a private

584
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
individual isolated not revealed to the

585
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,400
world

586
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,799
then it is much much much more difficult

587
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,840
for politicians

588
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,679
to steal your property uh because they

589
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,280
do not know that you exist

590
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,679
uh and that you have all of this capital

591
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,120
that is uh potentially

592
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,679
interesting to loot uh and here is where

593
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,280
again i think that the

594
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,840
the the strategy of crypto anarchy is is

595
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,720
so interesting

596
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,880
because first and foremost it is based

597
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
on solid first principles

598
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
individual anarchy right the individual

599
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,559
is the sovereign

600
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,880
ruler of the kingdom of self and no

601
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
external third party

602
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,280
uh is doing this uh and therefore all of

603
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,039
all of these these logical constructs

604
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
are still solid and based in crypto

605
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,840
anarchy because

606
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
it is an individualistic uh principle

607
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,679
and philosophy but second

608
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,080
it is extremely extremely efficient

609
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,840
because precisely it allows

610
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,240
the individual to selectively reveal

611
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,200
himself

612
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,280
and that aspect of choice is so inherent

613
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,840
in human existence and in human action

614
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,559
that it is so so so fundamental and and

615
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,640
crypto anarchy builds on top of that it

616
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
it thrives in that realm where

617
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
individuals are free to choose

618
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,360
uh and it is so true in in this aspect

619
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,880
and that's why i think that the hackers

620
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,559
congress specifically and what the peers

621
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,000
at parliamentary police have done

622
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,760
we're forwarding that education and that

623
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,000
understanding of this principle

624
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,840
is so so so incredibly valuable and and

625
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,200
that's why i'm so happy to be here

626
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,840
again uh on this talk um so i think this

627
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,520
is roughly what i wanted to cover

628
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,840
uh in a rough sketch outline and i would

629
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,039
be very very delighted

630
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,039
to hear your feedback right to hear your

631
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,960
reaction on what i have proposed now

632
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,360
because again i don't know there is so

633
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,720
much uncertainty

634
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
and i'm eager for that feedback to

635
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,480
further articulate for myself

636
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,559
this understanding to align my actions

637
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,080
properly so thank you very much for

638
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,799
listening and

639
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,600
please speak up

640
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,359
[Applause]

641
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,039
thanks a lot for your presentation i

642
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,559
forgot to

643
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,760
tell audience that uh they can ask

644
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,440
all the time during your presentation

645
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,840
but you had a so beautiful presentation

646
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,559
that it was

647
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,240
not necessary anyway so any questions

648
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,799
yeah um so i will also check yeah okay

649
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,919
where does the individual end so would

650
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,039
you think that kids

651
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,320
are an extension of the individual or

652
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,799
a spouse a husband or wife or partner

653
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,919
whatever

654
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,200
and when would you think that using time

655
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,000
for that extension of your individual is

656
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,280
more important than

657
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,440
the time for only yourself for example

658
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
um that's that's a very difficult

659
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,480
question right where does that

660
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,559
individuality come from right and and

661
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,919
when does it begin and when does it

662
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,559
start

663
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,120
uh and and again it's for me it's an

664
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,640
assumption it's very very very difficult

665
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,320
to speak clearly here on on when the

666
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,080
individual actually exists

667
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,919
um is it before birth right uh like

668
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,760
or is it even before conception right is

669
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
the individual already in a realm

670
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
around us and just not manifested in

671
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,720
bodily form

672
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,960
well maybe uh or does it actually happen

673
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,320
at conception right when you have the

674
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,600
sex and the orgasm

675
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
that might be the euphoria of two

676
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,720
individuals coming together

677
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
uh creating a third uh potentially right

678
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,000
uh or

679
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,919
is it at some point where the child is

680
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,760
in the womb and fosters and grows

681
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
his bodily form is this already the

682
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,600
individual manifesting himself

683
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,919
right or is it the mother actually

684
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,760
manifesting herself and and changing

685
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,200
within her own body

686
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,240
to eventually um kind of gift this this

687
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,080
bodily form to another individual

688
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,799
um maybe uh or or is it specifically

689
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,000
that point at birth

690
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,159
right where the individual does reveal

691
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,520
himself to the world

692
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,919
where he actually opens up and and steps

693
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,840
out and ventures out as the young fool

694
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,880
that he is

695
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,120
uh this might be that point where you

696
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,000
where the individual

697
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,360
actually becomes into existence um or it

698
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
might be at a later stage right maybe

699
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,240
for the first couple years

700
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,840
that a small child is no individual at

701
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,360
all right it can it cannot be

702
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,120
self-sufficient it cannot sustain itself

703
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,360
it does not know what is his it does not

704
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,600
orient himself it cannot really act

705
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,400
um it's it's a very vulnerable creature

706
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,200
is that already an

707
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,039
individual right or does it come at a

708
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,480
certain point in time

709
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,240
um now bureaucrats believe that

710
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,880
individuality starts at age 18 or 21

711
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,760
which of course completely up but

712
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,039
any of these previous

713
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,520
options are reasonable and quite frankly

714
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,918
i don't know

715
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,559
i think it's fuzzy it's continuous it's

716
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,039
not like it's discrete

717
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,919
any other questions

718
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,480
okay alexander

719
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,159
yeah thank you for a great presentation

720
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,720
um if i go back to philosophical history

721
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,919
i found it to be quite

722
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,679
quite kantian it's there's a lot of a

723
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,600
mono about the whole presentation

724
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,760
but if you go to hegel as sort of a post

725
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,080
content creative way about 20 30 years

726
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,840
later

727
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,679
what would you say if you propose rather

728
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,600
that it is the government to the state

729
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,400
the produced

730
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,720
individual and we're here to set the

731
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,919
individual free

732
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,320
yeah so you don't have the problem any

733
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,520
longer of an individual

734
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,039
to define when the individual starts

735
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,880
with a vigilance because

736
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,240
individuality is something that

737
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,080
governments love because they if they

738
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,000
want to lock you up

739
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,159
they create an individual and they call

740
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,440
it citizenship and they hold you

741
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,960
responsible for your actions according

742
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,320
to their standards and then they lock

743
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,360
you up which is the journey you're

744
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,080
talking about

745
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,760
because i completely agree on that one

746
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,600
but would it make it different for you

747
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,520
for for for the rest of your philosophy

748
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,720
if you rather said that

749
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
okay we were just tribal creatures

750
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,600
walking around statehood came along

751
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,000
statehood was hijacked by certain people

752
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,760
who had a certain sense of turn about

753
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,240
them and

754
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
loved power a bit too much and they

755
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,840
basically enslaved the rest of us and

756
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,400
one day they created the idea they did

757
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
the idea of the individual and

758
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,440
what if we hijacked that idea instead

759
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,159
and said okay you produced us

760
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,000
but now we are those individuals and now

761
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,440
we can go against the government and say

762
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
we could create a new era of history or

763
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,000
something we do

764
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,080
we just set free what what is your

765
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,039
reaction to that sort of more hegelian

766
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,880
prospect of the subject this is

767
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,320
basically a fundamental disagreement

768
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,520
with the first principles

769
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,720
right because the other first principle

770
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,279
is not individuality but collectivism

771
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,520
the state exists right and the state is

772
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,720
there and the state

773
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,799
acts and creates something and the

774
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,320
something that the state creates

775
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,640
is the individual right so it is a is a

776
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,600
fundamentally

777
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
uh fundamental disagreement on that

778
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,799
first principle right

779
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,120
um and and that's where and the reason

780
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,559
why i disagree with it is

781
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,039
is because i can very easily imagine a

782
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,559
state of the private individual

783
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,640
where the individual exists on his own

784
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,679
self-sufficiently

785
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,679
without any other individual without any

786
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,840
collective just on a lonely island

787
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,679
or in the middle of the woods you're

788
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,360
still exist you're still there

789
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,279
although there is no other collective

790
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,120
around you no other individual

791
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,760
um and and because that is a possible a

792
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,480
reasonable

793
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
scenario that i experience every time i

794
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,919
close the bathroom door when i'm on the

795
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,480
toilet

796
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,279
right that's why i think that this is

797
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,200
this is not really a reasonable or

798
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,600
a good approach okay it's funny because

799
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,279
then we disagree strongly we actually

800
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,200
agree on tactics and strategy and i find

801
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,240
that wonderful

802
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,840
i'll be the hegelian you're the content

803
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,158
perfect okay

804
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,000
hello um you say with more

805
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,120
opportunity with more creativity we get

806
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,440
more

807
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,880
opportunity we get more options uh

808
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,159
today comparison to all the communist

809
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,279
russia or china

810
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,400
or we have the paralysis of choice

811
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,840
so many options if you take an example

812
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,600
of a currency

813
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,640
instead of a state state the currency

814
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,520
now we can

815
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,679
choose so how do you think we should

816
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,840
choose for instance

817
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,600
currency just as an example on a massive

818
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,640
scale

819
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,640
uh when we have so many uh options

820
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,559
how do we do this on a massive how do we

821
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,679
find consensus

822
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,679
on a massive scale now when we have so

823
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,679
many options about everything

824
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,200
yeah that's the thing the more options

825
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
you have the larger is your opportunity

826
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,000
cost right

827
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,360
or um well not not actually exactly but

828
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,960
rather

829
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
when you have more options then usually

830
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,320
there is one option that is marginally

831
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,720
better than most others and your

832
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,000
opportunity cost is is

833
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,320
basically the second in line so not your

834
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,480
first best choice but the second

835
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,840
um right and and this is your

836
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,919
opportunity cost so even when there are

837
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,320
a plethora of other opportunity

838
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,080
opportunities that you could choose

839
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,559
the real cost for you is just the the

840
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,320
second most valuable that it would have

841
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,120
been to you

842
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,200
right um so so that's why i kind of

843
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
disagree that with a platform of choice

844
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:58,960
there's

845
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,760
um like that that is a bad thing um it

846
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,720
just means that we have more

847
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,640
opportunities but that aspect of ranking

848
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
it marginally is still there

849
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,840
and that aspect to choose the best is

850
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,440
still there and the real opportunity

851
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,640
cost is the second

852
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,400
and that you would have chosen if that

853
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
first approach was not there

854
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,559
um and how does that apply to money so

855
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,440
or

856
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
why is money useful first of all and

857
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,039
again based on my first principle

858
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:21,760
because it is

859
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,080
an individual defense right individuals

860
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,760
can utilize money to protect their

861
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,880
scarce resources

862
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,440
and their property rights in them and

863
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,159
this means

864
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,880
first of all to to get paid right to

865
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,080
demand to be paid

866
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,840
uh to say that i am producing something

867
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,520
i'm creating something of value

868
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,120
and i will give you that i will i will

869
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,399
do this for you i will solve this

870
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,360
problem for you

871
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,720
but only in exchange when i get

872
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
something in return and that something

873
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,039
is usually money

874
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,960
right so that is that that free aspect

875
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,159
of expression to create

876
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,720
value entrepreneurially as a revealed

877
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,520
individual

878
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,120
no longer as a private anonymous

879
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,360
individual in in isolation

880
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
but in that step of division of labor

881
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,880
and collaboration

882
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,760
and of course to hold your capital right

883
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,640
that is one of the

884
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,120
main major use cases of monetary good to

885
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
hold that capital for a prolonged time

886
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,840
period

887
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,240
precisely because you're uncertain about

888
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,440
what to choose

889
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
you have not yet done that marginal um

890
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,559
prioritization

891
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,399
of all the goods and services that you

892
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,159
want to have in the future

893
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,320
because if you would have done this then

894
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,000
you would already spend your lambo

895
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
your money today to buy the lambo in the

896
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,840
future right

897
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
or you would invest the money right now

898
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,960
for exactly

899
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,760
45 days until you know exactly and 45

900
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,360
days later at 12 o'clock i want to get

901
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,159
that lambo

902
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,600
right if you have all of this planned

903
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
out if there's no uncertainty at all

904
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,960
then you don't need money you just buy

905
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,640
the goods and services that you want

906
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,080
at whatever time frame that you define

907
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,919
in the contract but that aspect of

908
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,760
holding money is precisely to

909
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,080
to be in that realm of uncertainty to

910
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,679
not know exactly what you want in the

911
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,320
future

912
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,559
and therefore to have the desire to hold

913
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,080
a liquid good

914
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,799
a monetary asset that other individuals

915
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,120
desire too that other individuals demand

916
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,919
to be patent

917
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,919
right that aspect of liquidity is is so

918
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,120
important

919
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,960
and it is precisely there because you

920
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,240
you you

921
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,159
are uncertain about how much of what

922
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,520
good you want one

923
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,159
at what time and all these questions

924
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,039
money solves

925
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,039
it removes a lot of uneasiness because

926
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,320
you know you can buy anything that you

927
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:16,880
want

928
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,240
from anyone who demands to be paid in

929
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,919
money at any point in time

930
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,120
right that that's a huge um uh

931
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
hedge against this uncertainty uh to

932
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,039
know in whatever happens i have money

933
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,320
and that can buy me stuff

934
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,480
uh but of course this kind of comes down

935
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,320
to the question where do you store

936
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
uh that that purchasing power right

937
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,000
where do you store this value

938
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,559
uh and this is fundamentally uh because

939
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,760
demand is always uncertain

940
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,600
we got to worry about supply and this is

941
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,360
what is important in monetary theory one

942
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,880
is the monetary supply

943
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,559
and how does this increase or change

944
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,880
over time uh and and here i would argue

945
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,240
as an entrepreneur a

946
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,039
stable unchangeable value that i've

947
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,919
defined verified and enforced for myself

948
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,480
is is the most certain that i can be

949
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,159
that i will have the same percentage of

950
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,120
the money supply

951
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
right now and in the future and that

952
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,039
helps me a lot in individual resource

953
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,159
allocation

954
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,559
and i think these aspects are is why a

955
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,000
monetary good is important

956
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,360
uh and the best um good that satisfies

957
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,279
these these desires of the individual as

958
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,559
a use case um

959
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,880
that monetary asset will win in the long

960
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,039
term uh and it is a strong network

961
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,399
effect and

962
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,520
in the sense of competition in media of

963
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,320
exchange

964
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
it's a zero-sum game there's always one

965
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,919
winner there's always one loser

966
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,840
uh when exchanging media of exchange

967
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,039
fundamentally different

968
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,120
than when exchanging a media of exchange

969
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,559
for a good and service

970
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,039
uh buying something is very different

971
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,640
than to exchange foreign currencies

972
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,520
okay another two questions we have also

973
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,200
another question from the internet so

974
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,159
i'll ask

975
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,440
okay um so you probably know

976
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,320
schopenhauer um one can only do what one

977
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,880
wishes one can't choose one's wishes um

978
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
bad translation probably dimensions to

979
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,159
invasive well they're kind of

980
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,880
vaseville they can just volume um

981
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,799
ignoring universal determinism because

982
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,240
that's kind of a whole nother story we

983
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
probably shouldn't get into in a simple

984
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,320
question um

985
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,559
ignoring universal determinism how do

986
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,480
you feel that that relates to your view

987
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,159
of the individual with regards to

988
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,320
things like advertising essentially

989
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,240
pushing other people's will changing

990
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,919
what somebody wants

991
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,880
and therefore changing their actions how

992
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,399
does that fit in with your overall

993
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,679
philosophy

994
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,399
advertising is the entrepreneur deciding

995
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,480
to reveal himself to the world

996
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,039
as an entrepreneur who chooses to go out

997
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,399
and to venture and to seek

998
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,279
opportunities right and to ask others if

999
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,159
they have a problem

1000
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,840
and if they would like him to fix it

1001
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,600
fundamentally there's nothing wrong with

1002
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,320
advertising

1003
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,120
it's a fundamental human act of choosing

1004
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,840
privately

1005
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,600
uh or choosing to no longer be private

1006
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,120
and and to reveal yourself

1007
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,159
um very very good thing uh the issue is

1008
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:54,960
with fraud

1009
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,720
right if you promise to deliver

1010
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,159
something or no no i shouldn't say

1011
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:58,720
promise

1012
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,200
if you write a contract um stating that

1013
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,720
you will deliver a good in service in

1014
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,000
exchange for money

1015
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,679
you take the money and then you deliver

1016
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,120
a different good in service

1017
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,559
right that's fraud that's theft

1018
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,159
someone stole your money and gave you

1019
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,360
something else in exchange that you

1020
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,640
didn't want

1021
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,360
that is the the evil aspect so um and of

1022
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,880
course there's a gradient in between

1023
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,600
um where do you truthfully advertise

1024
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,480
your services

1025
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
where do you maybe um look at it

1026
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,000
exclusively from a positive

1027
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,679
light and you you don't explain

1028
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,279
trade-offs and downsides

1029
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,840
um or where do you frankly just lie and

1030
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,200
say complete fonts links

1031
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,640
um this is this is again something where

1032
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,720
individuals will make many nuances and i

1033
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,200
cannot make a blanket judgment statement

1034
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,760
but fundamentally there is a point where

1035
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,720
um

1036
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,799
where advertisement turns into fraud and

1037
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,480
and that is when something else is

1038
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,279
delivered

1039
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,960
then what was in the contract because

1040
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,720
the contract is not a promise

1041
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,440
it's not a promise so breaking that is

1042
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,240
is

1043
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,159
fraud and not just a small mistake

1044
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,279
thanks yes coming up

1045
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,320
um the card uh says that um

1046
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,720
uh i began to exist when i when i

1047
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,679
realized when

1048
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,799
the the thought that uh um i have

1049
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,679
the thought that i exist um in the

1050
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,399
beginning

1051
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,760
you said that you're not sure that if we

1052
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,600
really exist i mean there's no proof

1053
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,640
but um why would you say that

1054
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,559
descartes did not make this proof

1055
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,639
well i mean

1056
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,559
i mean basically that goes back to a

1057
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,080
question that we had earlier at what

1058
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,159
point does that individuality life start

1059
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,159
right and so if you haven't asked

1060
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,600
specifically that question

1061
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,720
of do i exist ever are you then do you

1062
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,240
exist already

1063
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,440
and i mean if

1064
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,039
yes exactly so so for example like a

1065
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,919
baby or like an unborn baby or

1066
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,840
in the womb probably has not asked

1067
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,080
himself the question of does he exist

1068
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,679
but there's already something there

1069
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,639
right so

1070
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,879
i'm a bit uncertain honestly i don't

1071
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:21,839
know exactly how to answer that

1072
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,000
uh yes yes i think um because

1073
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,918
mises calls it human action right he

1074
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,520
literally puts the term human

1075
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,040
in this and that aspect to prioritize

1076
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,359
to choose and to act and to manifest

1077
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,159
change

1078
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,119
is what is fundamentally human to me um

1079
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:53,679
though

1080
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,040
this is actually kind of what i wanted

1081
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,359
to highlight a bit in this specific talk

1082
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,520
i i don't think that human action

1083
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,480
specifically is

1084
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,640
is the the nice starting point i think

1085
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,839
we can go deeper

1086
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,359
uh because there's a lot of things

1087
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,040
already before human action

1088
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,480
right like like scarcity like like

1089
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,160
marginal preferences and so on

1090
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,560
all of this comes logically before human

1091
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,200
action

1092
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,920
uh so this is why i entitled this talk

1093
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,119
individual existence

1094
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,200
not individual action because i think

1095
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,440
that is the axiom that's starting point

1096
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,079
uh out of which scarcity can be deduced

1097
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,760
uh suffering can be deduced

1098
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,880
uh and action or valuables um

1099
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,800
subjective valuation can be deduced and

1100
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
then action can be deduced

1101
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,720
and and this is kind of what i wanted to

1102
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,800
say here building on top of mises

1103
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,440
that we can further distill and refine

1104
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,880
that first argument

1105
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,640
to actually become human existent

1106
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,200
it seems we we switched to quite complex

1107
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,640
philosophical discussion

1108
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,240
beautiful anyway so any question from

1109
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,680
audience because we have also the

1110
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,240
internet questions

1111
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,960
okay so let's look at the internet

1112
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,480
question

1113
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,880
so the first one uh apart from the long

1114
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,720
awaited book by paul okay that's me

1115
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,520
is there a book that teaches this so uh

1116
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,119
the question is you mentioned me

1117
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,480
in the beginning of your presentation

1118
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,119
that you are planning to write a book so

1119
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,800
tell us more about your book

1120
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,400
uh yes as so okay well first

1121
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,520
um the book that i can actually

1122
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,960
recommend is a book that i've reviewed

1123
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,000
the last couple days

1124
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,400
and as ludwig von mises a theory and

1125
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,119
history

1126
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,520
a beautiful philosophical treatise that

1127
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,640
describing exactly

1128
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,119
this this methodological approach of

1129
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,640
individual first axioms

1130
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,680
following logical reasoning uh on top uh

1131
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,560
and where he

1132
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,320
really goes down into these different

1133
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,640
potential axioms to be chosen and what

1134
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,760
follows logically

1135
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,359
as well as different just methodological

1136
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,200
approaches in general a very very

1137
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,079
valuable book

1138
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,760
in my opinion um and as you said uh

1139
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,200
i've thought about this for for quite

1140
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,040
some time and i

1141
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,960
i'm curious if i'm actually on the right

1142
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,640
track and for me

1143
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,040
that process or a process of finding

1144
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,880
that out is to explain it to others and

1145
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,839
to teach it

1146
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,280
and of course giving talks is one of the

1147
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,200
things that i do to get that feedback

1148
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,599
but in written form i value that quite a

1149
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,320
lot

1150
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,400
so the second book that i would like is

1151
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,160
the praxeology of privacy

1152
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,079
uh which explains exactly that that

1153
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,320
aspect right

1154
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,839
the first choosing that methodological

1155
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,839
approach of praxiology first principles

1156
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,760
and rational uh reasoning

1157
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
to then explore specifically what

1158
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,200
privacy actually is

1159
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,920
and how how this is so inherently human

1160
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,119
uh and and why

1161
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,800
well there's not necessarily a right for

1162
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,560
for privacy but it's just that

1163
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,160
individuals are inherently private

1164
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,880
beings uh and they do choose to reveal

1165
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,480
themselves selectively

1166
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,640
and this is something that i would like

1167
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,599
to highlight

1168
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,599
um and this is most of my work this is

1169
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,760
published for free and open source

1170
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,320
on github under the mit license and

1171
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,000
specifically at this stage i'm very much

1172
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,839
looking for contributors for a feedback

1173
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,320
on

1174
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,079
on the methodological approach as well

1175
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,680
of the structure of my logic

1176
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,200
so that is already on that github repo

1177
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,880
it's a pretty new one um

1178
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,240
and and i would be actually really

1179
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,160
really curious to to hear your feedback

1180
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,640
if

1181
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,480
if that line of reasoning in general

1182
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,320
makes sense right because again this is

1183
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,440
the feedback that i would like to

1184
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,000
receive

1185
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,760
to then further develop it and go into

1186
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,079
the nuances of it

1187
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,079
so i think that's this is one of the

1188
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,119
books that hopefully

1189
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,200
i will cover these topics adequately but

1190
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,720
very very early work in progress

1191
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,880
and we have another question and the

1192
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,520
question is is money only for uncertain

1193
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,640
people

1194
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,800
sorry what is money only for uncertain

1195
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,280
uncertain people

1196
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,960
oh for uncertain people um uh

1197
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,520
yes yes if you're certain you don't need

1198
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,480
money

1199
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,160
um why so if you know exactly that

1200
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,440
tomorrow at 15 o'clock you want to have

1201
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,119
a delicious ribeye steak

1202
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,520
right so so what you what you do is

1203
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,240
right now

1204
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
you go to sushi vidushi out there and

1205
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,359
tell the guy please a

1206
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,119
dried aged steak i wanted exactly at

1207
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,880
that time here is the money

1208
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,240
right i pay you the money right now here

1209
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,800
already here's the exchange that we do

1210
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,720
but i give you the money earlier than

1211
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,240
you actually deliver the good in service

1212
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,520
so i would like to receive an interest

1213
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,320
rate on this

1214
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,960
right so uh there's basically a debt i

1215
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,839
give you a

1216
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,079
15-hour debt or something and then you

1217
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,760
deliver that service so i want to get it

1218
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,320
cheaper

1219
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,760
right then that discount that time

1220
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,160
preference uh that is shown here

1221
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,400
um would be more more rational for you

1222
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
to do right if you know exactly what you

1223
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,359
want tomorrow

1224
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,440
then you pay for it now cheaper than you

1225
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,640
would pay for it tomorrow

1226
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,839
because the entrepreneur receives the

1227
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,359
money earlier he's willing to do that at

1228
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,960
a lower price

1229
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,400
because well time is scarce and

1230
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,200
so so if you are really not certain

1231
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,800
about what you want tomorrow you just

1232
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,160
buy it today

1233
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,920
and you do that with your entire cash

1234
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,599
balance um

1235
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,359
you don't need cash at all if you know

1236
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,720
exactly what you want

1237
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,920
but the problem is if there is a change

1238
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,400
uh in in in the scenario that you did

1239
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,359
not consider

1240
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,160
uh if there is one result of your action

1241
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,839
that you did not calculate for

1242
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,599
and if there comes up a new desire in

1243
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,480
you that becomes the most valuable

1244
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,119
in your preference scale then this means

1245
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,720
that you no longer have any capital

1246
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,000
right because you've already spent

1247
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,480
everything on on everything

1248
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,800
so this is where entrepreneurial action

1249
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,160
comes in right you

1250
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,440
um you you perceive that there is a

1251
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,720
potential in the future

1252
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,839
uh to solve a problem um and and if you

1253
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,880
want to do this

1254
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,680
but in because you are uncertain because

1255
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,040
there are just so many vast

1256
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,880
fast-reaching possibilities

1257
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,720
and because there's such a complex a

1258
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,480
complex network of

1259
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,520
causal relations and cause and effect um

1260
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,960
it is just going to be extremely

1261
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,880
extremely difficult to

1262
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,119
take everything into consideration and

1263
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,079
it's possible

1264
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,760
but it's very costly right it's going to

1265
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,960
cost you a lot of your time and

1266
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,680
resources

1267
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,560
to do all of these calculations and it's

1268
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,760
it's very fragile

1269
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,160
right if you if you make a mistake which

1270
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,040
entrepreneurs do

1271
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,960
all the time it's very difficult to fix

1272
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,560
problems and sometimes you don't

1273
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,280
um then you're completely bankrupt right

1274
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,040
because there's no cash reserve

1275
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,760
uh that you have uh so if you think that

1276
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,640
you're infallible and

1277
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,720
you never make any mistakes sure don't

1278
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,000
hold any money

1279
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,440
but if you are uncertain about the

1280
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,119
future and if there are some things that

1281
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:11,680
you

1282
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,640
that yeah that you that you think that

1283
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,240
might change in the future

1284
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,640
then holding money exactly protects you

1285
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,760
against that uncertainty

1286
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,440
because you have that liquid capital to

1287
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
fix any problem that comes up in the

1288
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,800
future

1289
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,040
of course if you have that capability

1290
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,880
but this is why actually i would say

1291
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,079
money is not for uncertain

1292
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,560
for certain people money really is for

1293
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,000
those entrepreneurs who are uncertain

1294
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,079
about the future which i think is a very

1295
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,599
reasonable thing to do

1296
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,359
or to be so therefore it's reasonable to

1297
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,119
hold a lot of money specifically

1298
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,079
magical cyberspace money this is quite

1299
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:44,720
interesting because

1300
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,359
this can be said also for example about

1301
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,160
insurance

1302
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,839
yes insurance is also for uncertain

1303
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,520
people because for example i know one

1304
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,319
very rich guy and he doesn't pay any

1305
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,520
insurance and he explained it doesn't

1306
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
make sense for him

1307
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,920
yeah exactly exactly that's the thing um

1308
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,119
insurance is another hatch against

1309
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,359
uncertainty you outsource potential risk

1310
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,880
to someone else and you pay for that

1311
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,040
service um but you know does it make

1312
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,400
sense at a certain point if you have a

1313
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,280
bunch of money

1314
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,640
if you have so much cash that um any

1315
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,560
any problem that comes up even if it's a

1316
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,800
huge problem you have enough capital

1317
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,880
liquid that you could hire other people

1318
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,160
to fix all of your problems

1319
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,240
right if if that capital reserve is that

1320
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,520
if that cash reserve

1321
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,920
is large enough to fix most problems

1322
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,200
that you can come up with

1323
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,560
well then you don't need to have any

1324
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,480
additional insurance right

1325
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,280
because all edge cases are covered

1326
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,880
because you have just that much money

1327
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,240
but of course if you don't have that

1328
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,839
much money if you have not yet built a

1329
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,359
huge cash reserve

1330
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,680
then it does make sense to also get an

1331
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,839
insurance because it's rather cheap

1332
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,240
right

1333
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
but you you protect yourself against a

1334
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,480
huge potential potential risk

1335
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,160
and that is a trade-off that many

1336
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,480
individuals see to be valuable

1337
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,079
in hiring a insurance agency

1338
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,730
okay max so thanks a lot

1339
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,150
