1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,080
so

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,400
usually um there was smuggler in me 2016

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,559
but we actually started wearing mask

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,320
2012 and i

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,000
would have to start presentations

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,400
explaining why we're wearing masks

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,680
and i would give her usually these

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,520
reasons you know uh

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,000
because we are uh privacy extremists and

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,560
we can

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,599
we um care about our privacy and uh

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,160
we actually thought in 2012 that we can

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,159
fly under the radar with masks

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,160
when we go to conferences and it didn't

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,440
really understand media

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,079
and uh that led to a lot of interviews

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,760
and even the movie

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,480
and yeah we wanted to start a movement

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,079
and then

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,160
this year we we cooked up some bad soup

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,000
and the thing went viral and now

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,079
everybody wears a mask

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,960
so um

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,520
and that's actually how memes work you

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,559
know

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,840
so everybody knows this but um

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,760
it doesn't necessarily have to do much

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,040
with reality

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
um and

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,680
last year i tried to do a meme

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,479
and i thought okay in 2020 the cyberpunk

33
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,759
age will start

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,159
and i had you know all these ideas um

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,040
how it's gonna

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,280
how it's gonna be in 2020 and it turned

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,040
out to be totally different

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,360
than what i expected but it's still

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,439
pretty cyberpunk-ish

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,680
and and during that time

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,600
i had some time where i was basically

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,720
you know

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
waking up every day and reading all the

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
news and

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,880
getting all the information and

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,560
following you know how it's going

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,640
up and going in china and all of this

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,840
and i also had times where basically uh

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
i got sick and

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,600
i didn't really know what i was having

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,119
and i didn't really know i was sick but

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,360
i was sick and

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
i consumed no news at all and no social

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,560
media nothing

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
and i had these two different

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,959
experiences and

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,200
and i could see how it really had an

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,360
impact on my mental state

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,560
and that kind of got me thinking on

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,879
memetic warfare because for me this year

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,080
was really

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,280
kind of pushing this idea that uh

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
of memetic warfare to the next level at

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,239
least that's how i experienced it

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,560
and so that's what i want to talk about

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,680
today

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,720
so first uh what is memetic warfare so

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
memetic warfare is a modern type of

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
information warfare and psychological

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,599
warfare involving

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,800
the propagation of memes on social media

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,080
through platform

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
weaponization that's from wikipedia

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
and thereby memes are replicating

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,720
information patterns

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,879
ways to do things learned elements of

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,599
culture beliefs or ideas

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,480
and it's even recognized by the nato now

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,879
so

80
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
memetic warfare is competition over

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,440
narratives ideas and social control in a

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,200
social media battlefield

83
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,040
one might think of it as a subset of

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,959
information operations

85
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,959
tailored to social media information

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,800
operations involves the collection

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,560
and dissemination of information to

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,080
establish

89
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,840
a competitive advantage over an opponent

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
and yeah that's basically what a lot of

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,280
people doing these days

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,000
especially the bitcoin maxis like max

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
over there

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
so the way i look at it is

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,959
memetic warfare is basically three

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,440
things you know we have we have memes

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
that's the you know information patterns

98
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,440
and we have different tribes that are

99
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,879
using these memes to

100
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,840
win a information war on the battlefield

101
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
and the tribes it can be you know state

102
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
actors it can be non-state actors like

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
corporations and it can also be

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,599
different interest groups that

105
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,360
spontaneously form you know

106
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
cryptocurrency proponents

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,360
and different ideologies and

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,879
what i find also interesting there is

109
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,239
that the battlefield i mean it's all

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,840
these different platforms and

111
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,000
they're not neutral of course i mean the

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
the platforms themselves they have their

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
own interests and they try to

114
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,840
to shape the uh the warfare going on

115
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
there

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,918
and so ultimately the goal i think of

117
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,680
memetic warfare is about

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
that you want to get to do people get to

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,320
uh people to do something

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,400
or get people not to do something that

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,720
they would otherwise do or not do

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,160
so because otherwise why you are

123
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,240
engaging in it and um

124
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
and to to reach that goal it uses uh

125
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
viral disinformation

126
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,840
usually trying to cloud rational

127
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,160
judgment

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,240
and so why is everybody

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,919
engaged in it i mean at least that's how

130
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,360
it seems to me that a lot of people are

131
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,520
engaged in memetic warfare

132
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
and although the game is rigged the

133
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
battlefield is neutral

134
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
you're competing with professionals i

135
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,400
mean

136
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
for example the russian troll army their

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,520
entire states they have

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,240
huge departments of people doing this

139
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
and it clouds judgment

140
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,560
which means it reduces the likelihood of

141
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,080
correct conclusions and

142
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
why are people doing it then and i think

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
this basically

144
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,639
because it feels good you know um memes

145
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,479
are the information equivalent of fast

146
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,320
food they make you feel good but lacks

147
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,479
substance

148
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,000
and tribes also feel good the old uh

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
us versus them game is always you know a

150
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,680
very

151
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
uh popular one and i think with

152
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,550
mimetic warfare it's very

153
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,880
[Music]

154
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
it's a very good mechanism to you know

155
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,720
become part of a tribe and fight against

156
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,160
the other guys

157
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,520
and uh social media is just basically

158
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
only about feelings anyway

159
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
you know i mean the whole the whole

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,000
reason of social media

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,919
or the whole goal of social media is to

162
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,759
maximize your engagement

163
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
and that's usually by evoking emotions

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
which can be good emotions or bad

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,440
emotions

166
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,759
and so why do these memes feel good

167
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,000
i think they often give you the

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,880
impression

169
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
that you don't have to change and that's

170
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
always good because changing

171
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,880
sucks and this work and so if you don't

172
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,479
have to change that's great

173
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,199
and it's also often it gives you the

174
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,639
impression that there's a simple

175
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,600
solution

176
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,960
um which is also great or that it's uh

177
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,759
things just solve itself automatically

178
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,319
and

179
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,960
uh often there's also some solution like

180
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,039
okay everybody has to change except me

181
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:33,759
of course

182
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
and then if they do that then the

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,039
problem is solved

184
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,639
um for example libertarians

185
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,160
i'm used to identify as one

186
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
there's often this idea you know we just

187
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
convinced everybody

188
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,360
you know to understand the philosophy

189
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,800
and then the world will change

190
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,240
and that also means the others have to

191
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,599
change i don't have to do anything

192
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
oops

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,199
there's some legs there sorry uh yeah so

194
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,639
it's always good if i don't have to

195
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,479
change and things will resolve itself or

196
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,520
by the others changing

197
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
and so memetic warfare basically is a

198
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
very easy way to make the world a better

199
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,360
place

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,639
by one tweet at a time and

201
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,160
what i want to talk about now is

202
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
basically uh

203
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,039
some older memes or at least what i

204
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,160
receive this memes

205
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,280
um and then some newer one and older

206
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,759
ones

207
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,280
they mean that means um yeah maybe five

208
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
years ten years old

209
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,759
so uh one one famous one was always okay

210
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,199
the internet will route around

211
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,479
censorship

212
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,680
so that was used a lot when when

213
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,960
you know when i was talking about

214
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,599
privacy and you know concerns about

215
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,440
censorship people would say okay but the

216
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,800
internet it just

217
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
routes around censorship so um

218
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,680
that means we don't have a problem and

219
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,039
um that's first of all it's factually

220
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:05,520
false

221
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,199
you know the internet is not like this

222
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,440
distributed thing it has actually

223
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,479
concrete you know it has like physical

224
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,759
cables and

225
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,599
it's not like a mesh net it has these

226
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,440
big physical cables

227
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,240
and that's where you can sensor easily

228
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,039
and also

229
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,140
it means that um

230
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,319
[Music]

231
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,400
that the whole you know center center

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,240
problem often moves to a different layer

233
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,520
you know what we can see with social

234
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,599
media is that uh

235
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,719
it's not censorship on the on the tcp ip

236
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,640
layer it sends a ship on the platform

237
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
layer that is actually the problem

238
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,159
so um and that's you know one meme where

239
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,080
you can see it's it's this thing like oh

240
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
yeah we don't have a problem it source

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
itself it will just rot around

242
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,120
and uh and then there's nothing we have

243
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,240
to do

244
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,600
and the next one was uh just use tor

245
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
uh which is even worse than the previous

246
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
one and it was always like okay i have a

247
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
privacy problem i need to anonymize

248
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,320
something

249
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,880
just use tor you know that solves the

250
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,440
problem

251
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,480
and um first of all if you try to use

252
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,320
tor today if you're not accessing hidden

253
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
services but if you

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,839
try to actually anonymize yourself on

255
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,080
the internet it's basically impossible

256
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,519
so i mean i don't know if you tried

257
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,360
recently but if you do

258
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
you use any website you basically become

259
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,360
a bot filling out captures

260
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,519
that's what you do all day and if you

261
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,519
try to register an email address

262
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,839
let's say with protonmail they don't

263
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,560
want just to

264
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,800
capture it they want a phone number or a

265
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
email and then if you use this

266
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,760
email service they don't accept you

267
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,160
if you're using tor um the secondary

268
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,519
email service

269
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,880
so um it was not just factually false

270
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,279
but

271
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,279
the even worse thing was that it um

272
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,480
it kind of hindered research into

273
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,360
anonymization technologies for probably

274
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,000
i would say

275
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,720
10 years you know i was always saying

276
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
that mixed networks are much

277
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
more capable of delivering true

278
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,079
anonymity

279
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,800
but this meme that you can just use tor

280
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
to solve the problem actually

281
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,480
kind of at least that's why impression

282
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,000
hindered research into

283
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,839
mixed networks luckily now some people

284
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,600
um started that up again

285
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,320
but um

286
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
yeah for me it showed how dangerous

287
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,160
these these memes can be

288
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
um oh that's another favorite uh

289
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,839
given enough eyeballs all such bugs are

290
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,880
shallow

291
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
that was also like when the you know

292
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,560
open source movement started

293
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
it's like somehow we don't have to take

294
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,399
care of quality anymore because you know

295
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:40,720
when

296
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,279
enough people look at it then there are

297
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,320
no bugs because

298
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,959
they're they're automatically found and

299
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,640
then over the years you could see you

300
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,519
know

301
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,360
these days people find bugs that are

302
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,560
10 20 30 years old and some ancient code

303
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
bases and nobody

304
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
somehow found them before although

305
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,399
everybody was looking at them

306
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,440
and there are other

307
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,000
techniques which are now coming up like

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,560
fuzzing

309
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,279
and things like that who actually find a

310
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,120
lot of bugs that they have been

311
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,240
undetected before and uh

312
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
yeah like i said there was another

313
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
another meme that kind of

314
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
hindered research because it told us oh

315
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,920
yeah we don't have to

316
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,880
we don't have to do anything um it

317
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,600
solves

318
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
itself itself automatically and

319
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,399
um if i if i look at it and try to

320
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,079
categorize into some you know common

321
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,279
fallacies

322
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,519
it's like often there is only one

323
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
solution um

324
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,040
it's something that is that is pushed

325
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
you know like like i said what is

326
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,880
uh with tor it's like okay this is the

327
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,399
solution use it

328
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,240
it's in a cryptocurrency space the same

329
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,600
it's always like oh yeah this is one

330
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,320
solution

331
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
you use it and then we solve the problem

332
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,600
and it also has often this implied thing

333
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,760
of we have to take over the world with

334
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,560
with our preferred solution which is an

335
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,480
ideal solution

336
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,760
and the big uh a big fallacy

337
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,360
i find in this space is that is often

338
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,240
assumed that the opponent is static so

339
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,519
we somehow have this you know

340
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,880
battlefield

341
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,600
where we um we try to improve a problem

342
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,040
and it is implicitly assumed in in uh

343
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,440
in the thinking that the opponent will

344
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,959
not react

345
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,639
you know let's say with cryptocurrencies

346
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,040
you know

347
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
everybody's using cryptocurrencies the

348
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,639
state will crumble

349
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,760
well they might react you know

350
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,160
and if you do not put that into your

351
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,120
thinking before

352
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,000
then um you're basically giving them a

353
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,040
huge advantage

354
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,560
um and

355
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,480
for from what i've seen recently this

356
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,390
you know warfare has really um

357
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,040
[Music]

358
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,839
took up speed uh it's it's became more

359
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,480
and more

360
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
and uh i think one of the driving

361
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,760
factors is uh

362
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,800
authority bias it's it's often you know

363
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,200
when we

364
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,000
when we see authorities doing something

365
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,079
um

366
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,360
yeah it gives this impression that

367
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,519
that is actually correct and also

368
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,839
popularity bias and social media really

369
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,600
you know push that forward and in social

370
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,279
media these two kind of come together

371
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,959
because how you're an authority these

372
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,880
days you become an authority by

373
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,320
popularity vote

374
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
so you have whatever 20 000 followers on

375
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,360
twitter and boom you're on authority

376
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
and like i said social media really

377
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
pushes that and

378
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,680
also um kind of creates this

379
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,920
information overload situation where we

380
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,519
um

381
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
where we get so much information that we

382
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
cannot really

383
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,490
process it anymore and

384
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,440
[Music]

385
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,160
therefore we kind of fall into these

386
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,320
simplistic thinking patterns and we

387
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,560
sometimes we just look at our own group

388
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,000
because then we don't have to deal with

389
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
all the other information

390
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,639
so you know creating this tribalization

391
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,959
and which is both a cause and effect i

392
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,480
mean it's

393
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,800
tribalization kind of causes this

394
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,720
memetic warfare but also the memetic

395
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,480
warfare and all these you know memes and

396
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,079
all the information overload

397
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,920
has the effect that it's it's easier if

398
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,160
you just you know focus on our own

399
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,839
our own group and it helps you to reduce

400
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,680
complexity you don't have to

401
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,440
you don't have to deal with all the

402
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,279
problems and

403
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,639
you just focus on your group you know

404
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,120
the favorite memes and it's also a great

405
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,079
way of you know

406
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,560
virtual signaling um because you can

407
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,279
show okay

408
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,320
i'm yeah i'm for

409
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
cryptocurrency a or i'm for this course

410
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,600
and then

411
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,240
you know you tried cheesy on and um but

412
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,839
it doesn't really help you to

413
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,680
find the actual truth and

414
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,560
so i want to be i want to look at some

415
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,399
newer memes

416
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,600
and just give you my my opinion on it

417
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,080
might be a little bit controversial

418
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,600
[Music]

419
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
yeah which was just like like the

420
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
earlier one it kind of pissed me off

421
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,639
honestly that it's always repeated

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,680
and usually it has this you know panacea

423
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,079
flair to it okay we just have to

424
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,680
decentralize everything

425
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,240
if we decentralize everything we don't

426
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,360
have a problem

427
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,440
and so first of all there is a

428
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,959
difference between

429
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,959
distribution and decentralization so

430
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,199
and often it's it's gets confused so if

431
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,000
we if we're talking about

432
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,519
decentralization what we're actually

433
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,519
talking about often is distribution

434
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,920
for example bitcoin and most other

435
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,279
cryptocurrencies they're not

436
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,199
decentralized they're just distributed

437
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,240
there's only one

438
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,440
consensus there's only one system so

439
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
it's not

440
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,440
that we have multiple systems it's like

441
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,360
multiple different rules competing with

442
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,680
each other it's just like one world set

443
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,920
and that is this decentralized over many

444
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,279
computers

445
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,720
and uh we don't really

446
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,320
solve problems magically by just

447
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,480
decentralizing them i mean it's a good

448
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,000
approach in many cases

449
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
but it doesn't solve everything um

450
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,399
another one is it just has to be

451
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,360
transparent

452
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,399
and uh find that a lot with

453
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,000
um complaints about the state

454
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,959
that yeah status you know in transparent

455
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,160
in some areas

456
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,440
if we just have make it transparent then

457
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,880
we don't have uh so many problems

458
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,279
but one of the big problems i see with

459
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,079
transparency is that

460
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,480
just because something is transparent

461
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,839
doesn't mean you can act on the

462
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,600
information

463
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,120
so um because acting on information

464
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
actually has a huge cost associated with

465
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,120
it you have to you know analyze the

466
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,079
information

467
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,839
you need the processing capability to

468
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
analyze it and then you need the ability

469
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,119
to act on it

470
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,119
i think we can see that with a lot of

471
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,740
these

472
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,919
[Music]

473
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,799
leaks you know like panama papers and

474
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,000
things like that

475
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,839
there's a lot of information which

476
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,959
basically which suddenly becomes public

477
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,199
and then it doesn't really change

478
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,480
anything because

479
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,559
nobody can really act on it and it's

480
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,240
it's a huge uh

481
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,640
treasure trove of information that um

482
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,120
has to be

483
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,960
acted on um it's the same with

484
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,080
public um what's called um

485
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,600
public offers you know when the state

486
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,919
says okay we want to build something

487
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,320
then uh we make it all transparent the

488
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,919
whole process

489
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,919
but you as a small company you cannot

490
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,039
really act on this

491
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,240
you know you have to be a large

492
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,559
corporation that is able to

493
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
fill all the papers you know do all this

494
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
huge transparent process and then

495
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,160
somehow you you make money in the end

496
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,640
and it

497
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,400
was all very transparent but it doesn't

498
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,880
mean that small

499
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,080
entities actually had a chance um

500
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,159
yeah bitcoin fixes this um

501
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,720
you know for me that's it's over

502
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,679
simplistic

503
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,240
first of all bitcoin is the technology

504
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,600
you know it's like okay you have a

505
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
problem you want to do payments

506
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,760
or you want to save money and then you

507
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,039
have a technology

508
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,000
which helps you to do that but i don't

509
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,080
really see the connection between

510
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,720
bitcoin and here we have no state you

511
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
know that's how it's often

512
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,600
you know shown it's like okay boom

513
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,480
bitcoin fixes this and then we have we

514
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,640
don't have a problem anymore

515
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,679
which like i said it often ignores

516
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,640
that the opponent isn't static you know

517
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,280
if you're

518
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,960
trying to take on the feared money

519
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,400
system

520
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,919
they're not going to be just sitting

521
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,840
there do nothing

522
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,240
you know it's like what we heard in the

523
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
in the panel discussion

524
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
the uh increasing kyc and aml you know

525
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,360
that

526
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,559
that was already obvious eight years ago

527
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,760
that it's gonna happen

528
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,720
because the more successful you become

529
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,039
the

530
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,919
uh the bigger the the force of the

531
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,200
opponent will be

532
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,880
to change the situation and um

533
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,720
it's a big fallacy to think that you

534
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
know the state

535
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,480
is not capable of doing these things

536
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,720
it's often just very slow

537
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,679
and it doesn't have to you know react to

538
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,200
any small threat

539
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,440
um

540
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
so which doesn't mean you know i'm i

541
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
don't think bitcoin is great

542
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,360
but it's like i said over simplistic to

543
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
say think okay it automatically solves

544
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,240
the problem

545
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,200
and it also doesn't automatically solve

546
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,160
all the problems

547
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
we still have a lot of other problems

548
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,270
and um

549
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,880
[Music]

550
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,159
yeah corollary to bitcoin fixes this is

551
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,840
smart contracts will solve this

552
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,679
um so

553
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,919
it somehow is this idea we have this you

554
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,440
know complicated

555
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,679
legal system human interactions

556
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,559
court cases or private mediation and we

557
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,159
somehow

558
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,400
we can distill all of this into software

559
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,400
that then decides automatically and

560
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,960
i think that's that's actually not just

561
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,320
wrong

562
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,360
it's dangerous because um

563
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,240
what that means is that you can predict

564
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
the future

565
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
you know it's i'm not talking about

566
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
something like you know you're doing a

567
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,440
market maker smart contract i'm talking

568
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,799
about complicated

569
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,080
problems and what you're doing there is

570
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,559
you

571
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,400
you basically saying yeah i can predict

572
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,240
the future even if you're able to you

573
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,720
know

574
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,640
write this all correctly which is hard

575
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,240
enough with solidity

576
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,640
you know it's even if you can do that

577
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,400
and you you can prove that your code

578
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,600
works correctly

579
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,200
it means that you can predict the future

580
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,919
for humans and then you know every

581
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,039
possibility

582
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,440
you decide in advance and

583
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,559
i think that's some some hubris involved

584
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,039
you know

585
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,760
and actually

586
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,080
do we really want that do we really want

587
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,480
you know like a program decide over

588
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,280
humans

589
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,480
in the future automatically and

590
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,039
not be able to you know change anything

591
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,880
anymore

592
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
um and the next one then

593
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,720
is basically that with a decentralized

594
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,559
autonomous organization

595
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,760
we don't have the problem um don't get

596
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,960
me wrong i see

597
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,640
think there's a lot of potential

598
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,720
in improving organizations with

599
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,320
different models you know moving away

600
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,960
from just like okay vc funded

601
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,120
startups you know where basically you

602
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,679
have the vcs you have the

603
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,440
the founders and they have the employees

604
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,679
and you know to create um

605
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,440
more flexible organizations i think

606
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,039
that's great but

607
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,640
similarly we it doesn't solve all the

608
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,200
problems automatically um

609
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,480
because the the basic human drive

610
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,960
that we have you know that some people

611
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
you know want to grab a bigger pig

612
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,520
a bigger piece of the pie and and things

613
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,039
like that they will still exist

614
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,880
and um so

615
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,919
there as well i think um it

616
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,240
yeah doesn't automatically solve it and

617
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,840
actually prevents us from finding good

618
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,799
solutions if we

619
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,158
oversimplify it um

620
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,559
okay yeah and some

621
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,120
some fallacies i saw over the years uh

622
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,320
actually this one i

623
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,840
i fell in too many times

624
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,640
i i call it the loophole fallacy so

625
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,520
especially libertarians often this

626
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,720
thinking is okay

627
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,159
i have to find the loophole you know the

628
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,799
tax law x that saves me money or

629
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,760
passport y

630
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,919
from country z and i don't have a

631
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,360
problem anymore

632
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,799
and i think the big problem with this

633
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,679
approach is that it actually implies

634
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,679
something about the state that the state

635
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:32,320
doesn't

636
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,039
fulfill namely that it acts according to

637
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,400
its own laws

638
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,440
and it doesn't and also

639
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,880
again it's not static so um just because

640
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,480
there is a loophole if you actually

641
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,679
exploit the loophole

642
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,279
there won't be the loophole anymore in

643
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,960
the future and

644
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,440
i think that's you know wastes a lot of

645
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,039
energy often

646
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,960
and um corollary is the technology will

647
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,919
fix it

648
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,760
again it's like okay somehow

649
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,520
automatically technology will solve the

650
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,559
problem

651
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,080
and um i think it kind of ignores that

652
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,600
technology is neutral and there are

653
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,799
different groups who

654
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,679
uh you know can you can push for privacy

655
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,880
and you can push for

656
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,760
a surveillance state and um it really

657
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
depends what we build it doesn't

658
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,159
automatically

659
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,120
solve solve the problem similar to the

660
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
market will fix it

661
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,919
you know there is no market it's if if

662
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,600
there's nobody doing anything

663
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,840
then the market doesn't matter so it's

664
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,679
in the end it's about people

665
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,720
acting on the market that will solve the

666
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,480
problem or not solve the problem

667
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,440
the market itself doesn't really care um

668
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,279
yeah this year a big one for me

669
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,400
really surprised me libertarian covet 19

670
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,919
reasoning

671
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,960
was okay state interventions are bad

672
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
the state and x covet 19 measures

673
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,720
conclusion there's no virus

674
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
um

675
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,520
it's true

676
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
yeah you have to walk to me through this

677
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,320
uh this reasoning later then um

678
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,840
i really don't get it um okay

679
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,440
so what does it mean for society and

680
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,559
one's personal life um

681
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,039
i think we kind of like with 2020

682
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,320
cyberpunk age

683
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,200
we reached the future shock state

684
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,080
described

685
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,400
1970 too much change in too short of a

686
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,080
period of time

687
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,279
and uh yeah it's my impression that we

688
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,880
really um

689
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,480
we arrived there you know especially

690
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,360
with some events happening

691
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,440
a lot of things changing that we're

692
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,960
basically overwhelmed with too much

693
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,080
information these days

694
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,200
and um which i think

695
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,000
is one of the reasons why uh opinions

696
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,760
are so fragmented you know it's

697
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,679
everything is so polarized and uh

698
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,679
yeah we i think often we don't really

699
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,120
understand

700
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,320
the the present anymore and uh so i was

701
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,240
wondering okay how do we stay sane

702
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,840
in an insane world

703
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,120
it's just my my personal opinion but i

704
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
think it's important to

705
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,400
try to detribalize and search for real

706
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,320
diversity of opinion

707
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,080
and i highlighted opinion because i

708
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,760
think there's a lot of talk about

709
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,600
diversity

710
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,080
and it's diversity talk is usually about

711
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,760
very superficial things you know it's

712
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,799
like okay you have to

713
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,960
you need 50 men and women you need

714
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,559
different skin colors

715
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,240
but what we actually need i think is you

716
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,159
need diversity of opinion and that's the

717
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,919
hard thing to find

718
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,360
do you you know look for um

719
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,880
to actually you know deliberately

720
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,720
search for opinions that conflict with

721
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,080
your own ones and

722
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,799
um and for that what also is really

723
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,840
helpful i think is

724
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,679
disconnecting i said in the beginning

725
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,440
for me that was a really good experience

726
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,720
to just you know

727
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,400
detach for months and be able to um

728
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,640
yeah not take in all the the information

729
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,520
immediately

730
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,640
and um because that that's that's part

731
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,000
of the problem with the information

732
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,679
overload we have is not just the amount

733
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,919
of information but also the speed

734
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,039
and sometimes i think we need to do some

735
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,240
some fasting and uh you know when memes

736
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
put your brain in a box perspective gets

737
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,080
it out and

738
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,600
detribalization and also fasting gets

739
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,719
you gets you out of it

740
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,159
um

741
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,159
yeah embrace uncertainty um

742
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,039
to go back to the to the covet thing i

743
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:41,919
think that's also

744
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,880
some some um

745
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,480
some trend today is that everybody wants

746
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:48,880
to

747
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,360
be certain immediately and especially

748
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,720
when we don't

749
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,919
when we cannot be certain you you cannot

750
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:56,960
really reach

751
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,440
in a correct conclusion so and it's i

752
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,960
think it's really important to

753
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
sometimes say okay i really don't know

754
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,159
and

755
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,960
maybe nobody knows at this point and

756
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,240
embrace that

757
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,480
and you know have this humility and say

758
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,080
okay i really don't know

759
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,200
and because when you when you're still

760
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,159
in that stage of

761
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,159
uncertainty you can you can actually

762
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,600
consider different options

763
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,279
and um yeah finally that

764
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,120
you know reminding ourselves that the

765
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,399
actions are matter

766
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,240
and that we that we don't really change

767
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,440
the world by you know

768
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,159
posting memes all the time but actually

769
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,279
the most important things are our

770
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,000
actions

771
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,360
and um and you know when you when you

772
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,320
look at the

773
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,200
the uh information landscape then i

774
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,799
think it's it's helpful to ask these

775
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,080
questions

776
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,919
who does it serve if i do this or if i

777
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,080
don't do this

778
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,000
because usually or very often it's

779
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,919
somebody else's agenda

780
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,840
how might the opponent react if this

781
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,360
approach is successful

782
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,760
you know it goes back to this concept of

783
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
odor loops again you know that

784
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,919
the opponent isn't static and if we want

785
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,919
to win something we have to consider

786
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,840
their reaction bef

787
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,200
before we we do it and um

788
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
yeah who might have opposing views and

789
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,440
why just you know detribalization again

790
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,360
trying to find different viewpoints and

791
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,440
and not thinking that they're stupid

792
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,320
it's usually the other group is not

793
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,279
stupid

794
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,360
um what if nobody knows

795
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,919
embrace uncertainty and how can i test

796
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:28,720
this myself

797
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,480
preferably in meat space um

798
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,960
yeah and i want to close with one of my

799
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,799
favorite quotes that point of view is

800
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,200
worth atr cue points

801
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,480
which makes you super smart

802
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,640
yeah so that's basically it thank you

803
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,840
very much for listening

804
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,720
thanks smuggler for discussing

805
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,640
discussions about this yeah somebody

806
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,840
mentioned it we

807
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,200
we ramble a lot longer than this

808
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,000
on the podcast you can contact me here

809
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,919
download the slides and

810
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,840
yeah i'm very happy to answer some

811
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,840
questions and thanks for listening again

812
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,000
yes thank you frank that was a great uh

813
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
presentation um i would love to

814
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,120
get to audience questions but just to

815
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,200
warn you up and get uh one of you

816
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,919
um you know having a tribe is useful

817
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,640
sometimes

818
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,120
uh because to have peers uh to fight for

819
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,559
that have similar principles that have

820
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,480
similar opinions and share that

821
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,320
is is a nice curation of whom to

822
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,520
collaborate with but

823
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,360
at what point does the tribalism

824
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,880
actually go negative

825
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,279
and and become no longer useful and

826
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,480
actually go into warfare

827
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,760
well i think when you first of all i

828
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,360
totally agree with you it's very useful

829
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,679
and

830
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,000
it's it's not just useful it's also very

831
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
um

832
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,440
yeah it's a good thing you know it's

833
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,600
like having a family uh it's it's a

834
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,120
great thing to have peers

835
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,880
i think it becomes problematic at the

836
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,320
point where you're completely closed off

837
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,919
to outside information to

838
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,799
to new points of view when it becomes

839
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,279
yeah

840
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,279
totally dogmatic i think that's that's

841
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,840
the point where it changes

842
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,000
so um first of all i consider myself a

843
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
libertarian

844
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,960
and just because the government is

845
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,240
taking like

846
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,880
over away our freedoms and stuff doesn't

847
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,320
mean that i don't believe there is a

848
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,880
virus

849
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,679
so i think you're assuming that all

850
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,360
libertarians thinks they're

851
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,760
there isn't the virus doesn't exist but

852
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,960
i don't know anyone

853
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,159
that is a libertarian that says souls

854
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,000
and then you said that you should not

855
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,360
assume that

856
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,880
someone that thinks different than you

857
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,120
is stupid but i think you just did that

858
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,760
no i was i wasn't implying that for all

859
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,159
returns i consider myself a libertarian

860
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,760
so um it was just my impression

861
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,960
what i had at some online things that

862
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,360
i i

863
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,840
i saw a lot of knee-jerk reactions which

864
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
basically were like okay the state does

865
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,120
something

866
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,080
and we hate the state and therefore it's

867
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,360
always bad

868
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,320
that was my impression

869
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,240
i i would like to ask if you think there

870
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,559
is any connection between the concept of

871
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,679
internet meme

872
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,720
and the concept of evolutionary meme do

873
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,640
you think that internet memes have

874
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,519
mind of their own and they want to

875
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,799
spread themselves

876
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,120
and ensure their survival thank you

877
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,640
i think there is a connection yeah i

878
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,880
think it's a useful

879
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,600
it is it's a useful at least it's a

880
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,360
useful abstraction to

881
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,760
to view genes and memes as similar and

882
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,600
that they kind of develop a mind of

883
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,000
their own

884
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,240
can i ask the question answer the

885
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,519
question actually

886
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,720
so biological viruses and

887
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,440
informational ones which are memes both

888
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,159
of them have

889
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,960
a life cycle

890
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,440
the definition of meme is an

891
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,720
informational virus

892
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,240
anyhow both things have life cycles

893
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,720
which

894
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,240
can be pretty much the same for example

895
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,799
and informational viruses which are

896
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,600
memes

897
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,640
they even can can mutate

898
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,840
uh for example because of the some

899
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,320
because of some something breaks in the

900
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,519
transmission path

901
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,760
or because something gets broken while

902
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,720
decoding or

903
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,480
encoding the information and of course

904
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,919
a lot of things can be changed

905
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,519
because of the host because of the

906
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,840
mental storage that the host has

907
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,040
which is basically if you tweak the

908
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,399
sentences a bit

909
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,918
are still about biological viruses

910
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,839
my question would be how can you get the

911
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,399
immunity

912
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,679
against informational viruses

913
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,560
because as far if you if we talk about

914
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,079
biology then

915
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,520
you still need to get a huge capacity

916
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,679
of your brain to be able to encode and

917
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,760
decode a lot of information

918
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,239
to be able to pass it and especially to

919
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:38,960
pass it

920
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,119
to your allies to someone that should

921
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,719
have the same

922
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,599
information the key to unlock the

923
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,560
information

924
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,040
but that should be pretty complex

925
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,079
otherwise

926
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,520
we get just parasitic memes that we

927
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,679
can see all over the place these days

928
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,280
and they do more harm

929
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,320
than gain immunity

930
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,680
well i think to to gain immunity

931
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,799
that's where the um

932
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,280
the analogy breaks down i mean like a

933
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,240
virus is

934
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,480
you know some virus enters your your

935
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,440
body and

936
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,119
you know interacts with your immune

937
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,440
system you don't really

938
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,359
it's an automatic reaction you don't

939
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,839
really have any volition in the process

940
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,240
but with with memes with information you

941
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,400
actually you have

942
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,320
free will you know you can actually look

943
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,560
at the information yourself

944
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,760
and assess it and

945
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,880
there you can actually

946
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,400
choose and like i said for me

947
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,680
one of the biggest things is to

948
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,440
i mean to gain immunity are the things i

949
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,800
mentioned in the presentation you know

950
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,720
you try to you put space between you

951
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,480
know input and output

952
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
you look for different opinions you try

953
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,680
to

954
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,920
embrace uncertainty of course you talk

955
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,599
to other people

956
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,560
and that's how you can

957
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,079
well gain immunity i don't know if you

958
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,240
actually need to have immunity against

959
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,599
ideas you know i think sorry can i

960
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,640
try to answer that uh like uh

961
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,119
paul paul rusenberg sorry sorry paul

962
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:15,760
sorry

963
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,599
can we stay for the questions and have

964
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,680
the you know discussion

965
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,119
yeah about about uh meme immunity

966
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,200
so how do you gain immunity i think paul

967
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,240
rusenberg has

968
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,079
answered that quite brilliantly in his

969
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,079
book god wants you dead which is all

970
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,280
about memes and

971
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,200
meme complexes and how they evolve

972
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,800
so the way to have immunity is to

973
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,839
question everything you need to to

974
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,000
question each

975
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,680
each part of a meme or a meme complex

976
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,720
like any ideology is a meme complex any

977
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720
religion is a meme complex it's

978
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,920
made up of several different ideas and

979
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,160
some ideas are good and beneficial

980
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,800
for your own individual survival some

981
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,240
are not

982
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,119
so never buy the whole package you need

983
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:05,520
to

984
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,520
question everything individually

985
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,040
so that's that's part of it and i highly

986
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,760
recommend

987
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,160
reading paul ruthenberg's book god wants

988
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,560
you dead

989
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,599
hi um first of all just want to say

990
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,280
thanks for a great presentation

991
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,359
uh i couldn't read any of the slides i

992
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,720
hope you changed the color scheme the

993
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,760
next time

994
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,359
um i said yeah for no virus what i was

995
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,400
meaning specifically was um i think this

996
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,920
is a bad case of the flu i hope you

997
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,119
don't get it i hope you don't get it we

998
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:37,839
don't get it

999
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,320
but to shut down the world economy put

1000
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,520
all these people on the dole

1001
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,160
unemployed and sort of limited freedoms

1002
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,800
in the future

1003
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,160
for 1 million deaths out of nearly 8

1004
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,520
billion people i think is a massive

1005
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,640
overreaction

1006
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,520
for me it's clearly the beginning of the

1007
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,400
great reset

1008
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,560
so i guess this is nothing new for you

1009
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,640
guys in here but the world outside

1010
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,119
they um yeah i think it's not going to

1011
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,320
be great

1012
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,839
for quite a while

1013
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,680
will be nice to get one more question in

1014
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,040
thanks um how

1015
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,520
do i question everything without going

1016
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,839
nuts

1017
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,000
and and if i if i may add

1018
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,440
just one one thing um

1019
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,119
i think i forgot it now um

1020
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,680
oh yeah i think the key

1021
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,200
about corona is not if the virus exists

1022
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,079
or not

1023
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,119
but what is the effect of the false

1024
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,800
positive ratios

1025
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,079
percentage of tests i think it's one

1026
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,079
critical issue thank you

1027
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,560
well i don't know how you don't get nuts

1028
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,280
you know it's

1029
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,520
um

1030
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,839
give yourself some space

1031
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:29,839
sabbaticals yeah current time

1032
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,839
so um in order

1033
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,800
you need to have something against what

1034
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,480
you would verify the incoming

1035
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,920
information

1036
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,079
and that something should be your inner

1037
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,280
system of values

1038
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,359
which would be the most robust thing

1039
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,960
that you ever have

1040
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,400
in your life because if you use

1041
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,079
the information and if you verify the

1042
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,320
incoming information against again

1043
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,760
some outer system you will be always

1044
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,880
confused

1045
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,720
because you will not get you will not

1046
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,480
even understand and comprehend

1047
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
part of this information and you will

1048
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,680
not understand how

1049
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,400
the verification system works if you

1050
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,920
build that verification system within

1051
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,040
within yourself

1052
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,800
using knowledge tools experience and

1053
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,119
blah blah and meditation and sabbaticals

1054
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,400
you have chances to still stay stay sane

1055
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,000
a bit there was a question in the back

1056
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,359
there

1057
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,200
i'm sorry that i'm taking part in the

1058
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,599
discussion now

1059
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,319
don't forget that ideas are not and even

1060
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,720
our biological immune system has nothing

1061
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,440
to do with

1062
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,680
um individuals it has to do with groups

1063
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,079
and groups verify and groups build

1064
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:48,800
immunity

1065
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,160
even your body is a group of systems

1066
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,040
and parts that react and for your

1067
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,119
reaction to virus for example a lot of

1068
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,280
that has to die to actually find out how

1069
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,440
to defend yourself against that

1070
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,440
so i would suggest if i may

1071
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,079
look at the people that run around with

1072
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:08,880
certain

1073
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,079
memes look at their emotional stability

1074
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,640
psychological stability whatever and

1075
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,440
that alone

1076
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,640
gives you a good indicator of how

1077
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,319
healthy they are and if you should

1078
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,430
follow that name

1079
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,760
[Applause]

1080
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,119
that sounds like solid advice

1081
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,839
any final questions

1082
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,040
uh i feel like the meme culture and

1083
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,960
people fighting on the internet

1084
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,680
has a lot to do with like being unhappy

1085
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,920
and being frustrated in your life

1086
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,960
because i think if you're a happy and

1087
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,000
okay person you not like spend hours of

1088
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,560
your day

1089
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,640
like fighting random people on the

1090
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,760
internet so

1091
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
i think we should be taking care more

1092
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,119
like our

1093
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,040
health in like mental health and like

1094
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,960
i think that would solve everything i

1095
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,200
don't know

1096
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,200
yeah i think you're right um absolutely

1097
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,359
i took a lot of walks this year and that

1098
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,960
really helped my mental state i have to

1099
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,720
say there was a period where i didn't

1100
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,760
read anything you know unfortunately

1101
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,079
i got sick then because i did the walks

1102
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,680
but that's a different story

1103
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,000
but absolutely yeah it's it's it's a

1104
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,880
mental health

1105
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,640
thing and sitting in front of a keyboard

1106
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,160
fighting with strangers on the internet

1107
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:59,839
usually doesn't help

1108
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,799
you
