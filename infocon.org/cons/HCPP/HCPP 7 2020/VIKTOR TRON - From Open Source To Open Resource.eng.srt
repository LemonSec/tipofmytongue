00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,919
so hello everyone

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,800
uh today i'm going to talk a bit about

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,719
my my project uh

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,079
swarm and i would like to put in in the

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,600
in a bit of a general context of of

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,400
why why it matters in the in the in the

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,199
kind of

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,960
looking at the bigger picture of

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,119
technology

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,039
and would like to uh

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,960
in the in a historical context and

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,079
and and point out some some of the

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,800
expected social impacts of of what we're

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,320
trying to do

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,680
so the swarm is that

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,680
as a as a as a project um

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,360
within within the within the ethereum

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,120
ecosystem um it was it was part of the

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,440
original ethereum vision

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,080
um as as um

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,640
part of the vision of the world computer

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,280
which is

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,000
um was based on the idea that the

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,880
blockchain

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,520
itself is is is is bringing secure

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,479
on the global scale and that therefore

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,840
it can serve as the

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,200
as the cpu of this world computer um

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,119
the the idea being that the world

31
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,280
computer is is a computational

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,159
environment or

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,759
operating system for the new

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,439
decentralized web

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,720
and for for in order to provide a proper

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,119
computational environment you you don't

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:37,759
only need

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,280
the cpu but but you need

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
like the analog hard disk and and

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,439
of of messaging and the communication

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,320
component

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
and and and therefore it was envisioned

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
that that swarm um

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,520
is is is the is the hard disk is the

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,880
storage component and and this

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,759
it was the original messaging component

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,960
swarm's vision uh

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
blue since then uh quite a bit and

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,479
and we we we extended our scope to to

50
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,120
provide

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,280
basically future proof infrastructure

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,800
for for for ourselves

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,599
in a global digital society what does

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,080
this all mean

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,920
it means that uh

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,440
from from from the from this basically

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,480
from this narrow narrow scope of of of

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,840
decentralized storage and form

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,800
grew um to to feel this niche and and

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,680
and realize that

61
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,680
mainly uh by by extending the blockchain

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,959
with with the with

63
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,120
the components that that provide a

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,239
global

65
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,280
global running in execution

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,599
and and deployment environment for for

67
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,360
web applications

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,640
in general and

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,680
so so we we we

70
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,920
want to provide the infrastructure which

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,879
is which is

72
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,440
uh scalable as stable and and

73
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,360
most of economically self-sustaining so

74
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,319
maybe maybe a bit of a bit of a recap

75
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,400
of the innovations in the in the space

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
would be would be needed

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
so what what happened when when when

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,640
first bitcoin came

79
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,239
it's it's it it brought a big change

80
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,000
basically decentralized consensus

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,640
and and this changed everything because

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,280
uh

83
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,000
first of all it it became possible to to

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
to coordinate

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,760
action and and and provide a single

86
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
source of truth

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
um well it was

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,760
previously not past sort of

89
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,760
uh monopoly of force

90
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,439
standing behind the the single source of

91
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,239
truth

92
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,519
and um and and then they came ethereum

93
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,959
with the innovation that

94
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,320
uh you realize that that that

95
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,520
it's it's not only some some

96
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,639
simple simple database

97
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,880
and and and simple calculations that you

98
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
that you can provide

99
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
decentralized consensus to but you can

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,400
actually put the whole

101
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,160
virtual machine and the interior and

102
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,199
complete computation

103
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,800
and and have decentralized consensus on

104
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,919
the state of a

105
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,600
very complex system with with the

106
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
complexity and arbitrarily complex the

107
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
state transitions

108
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,960
so so the ethereum really really

109
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,400
generalized this idea and and and and

110
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,440
we we believe that that swarm finally

111
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,919
finally brings and and and closes this

112
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,800
circle

113
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
by providing uh the the the necessary

114
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,880
components to

115
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,240
to make this made this um global

116
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,039
computation

117
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,039
environment like like an operating

118
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,400
system to the web

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,440
so so this one we really want to provide

120
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,720
provide the back end to web three and

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,919
build up from from from

122
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,160
really basic api primitives we adapt

123
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,160
the web stack that allows

124
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,840
application developers to to to to

125
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
develop and

126
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,600
deploy web applications

127
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,280
and and and since since the

128
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,320
the the web now serves uh quite a

129
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,840
quite important part of the

130
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,400
this this says this has major impact in

131
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,840
in in in

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,160
in in activity and and therefore

133
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
in important to to

134
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,080
about this this development so what what

135
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,240
motivated originally

136
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
the uh the

137
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
the division that that web three

138
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,240
should change the original vision of f3

139
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,280
it was basically uh the the the

140
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,400
realization that

141
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,080
that we had to there was a

142
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,759
there was a a lot of

143
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
with the web as

144
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,000
as it

145
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,400
basic basically if even if you consider

146
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,319
consider publication only

147
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,360
as a as a slice of

148
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,479
slice of activities on the web

149
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,319
even even then you feel that people

150
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
have forced it

151
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,280
in the sense that uh compared to the

152
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,560
the web one iran when you

153
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,599
when you self self-hosted your content

154
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,759
and therefore you had to deal with with

155
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,280
the scalability issues of

156
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,599
hosting there can be companies which

157
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,120
scalable and

158
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,319
and and and therefore alleviated the

159
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,080
pain of of

160
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,639
of deploying and and maintaining your

161
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,080
your servers that

162
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,479
that that that are needed to

163
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,639
content but but this came with the with

164
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,440
the

165
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,720
with a bit of a

166
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,599
problem because it led to platforms and

167
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,800
data silos

168
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,759
which which now contributed to the

169
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,120
fragmentation of the web

170
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,879
and and is to to

171
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,400
connect collect data and have a lot of

172
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,599
impact on

173
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,240
who can who can access and and who can

174
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,199
publish

175
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,479
and on the web and

176
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,280
basically the the a lot of cases of the

177
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,759
platform the content creators

178
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,360
testify to this to this problem

179
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,879
very late so so so censorship resistance

180
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,440
or maybe a bit more diplomatic term

181
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,400
permissionless

182
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,360
publishing is is is is

183
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
required a feature that that

184
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,559
you know that's the end and and and then

185
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,000
this paradigm must provide in in general

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
we can talk about not only publication

187
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,040
but

188
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,399
since since these things

189
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,880
not only sharing information but serve

190
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,600
as a

191
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,200
as a back-end to major economic

192
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,360
transactions

193
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,399
of a lot of data and value

194
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,120
then we can we can think of

195
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,839
of the the service that it provides a

196
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,399
health

197
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,160
permissionless access to to to move

198
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,959
to to digital infrastructure in general

199
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
and and that that includes

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
all kinds of you know computational

201
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,839
tasks not only not only

202
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,839
consuming information um

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
a few words about about how how

204
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,640
swan is is he's trying to attack this

205
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,839
problem

206
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,120
because it's this one is often often at

207
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,800
this

208
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,920
in the uh

209
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,360
in the context of decentralized story

210
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
mainly because that's that's how it

211
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
originated

212
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,880
and

213
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,079
it's really really a lot more than that

214
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:14,560
because

215
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,720
because as i said we provide

216
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,920
the communication component which which

217
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,040
is

218
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,480
the the underlying

219
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,240
underlying

220
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,279
storage solution so what what's what's

221
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,480
what's sets one apart from

222
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,920
from similar

223
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,360
similar projects for example ipfsn

224
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
and and then some others one even even

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
victorian

226
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
is is the disk model that's that's

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,279
that's the

228
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,160
that's at the heart of it so the the

229
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
disk model

230
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,160
is stands for distributed immutable

231
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,000
storage of chunks

232
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,839
it's it's it's it's it is basically a

233
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,959
distributed store of fixed

234
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,000
sized data and

235
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,839
uh which is

236
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,360
based on based on a

237
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
distributed network of

238
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
services

239
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,399
there's a

240
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,240
story storage notes and

241
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,680
the difference is that while

242
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,800
while by viktor and the others you

243
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
use the distributed hash table and then

244
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
the lookup mechanism

245
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,959
to to look up data about the

246
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,160
the whereabouts of the source of

247
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,600
i found so basically

248
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,440
we trying to give you information about

249
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,240
where you can download the file from in

250
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,480
in

251
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,279
in swamp you actually store the

252
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
information the very information

253
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
in in the locality of the network that's

254
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,720
that

255
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,839
corresponds to the to the to the address

256
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,440
of the piece of data

257
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,760
so basically addresses

258
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,000
are in the in the same

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,760
address spaces as the pieces of data

260
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,279
and then this this is

261
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,880
this says uh this this local storage

262
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,760
interpretation of the phd has uh

263
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
important consequences on

264
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
on on on the workings of the

265
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,240
network namely uh it

266
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
it has the consequence that that

267
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,880
when you upload something to this one

268
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
that constitutes a genuine upload to

269
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,200
cloud storage

270
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,519
as opposed to this the other systems

271
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,839
which are more like

272
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,320
wearing base based on fire sharing

273
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,519
paradigm

274
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,560
that means that when you open up your

275
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,440
hard disk

276
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,839
before or use it

277
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,440
when someone is interested in that they

278
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
become seeders themselves

279
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
however there is no genuine distribution

280
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,519
and approach in swan you have upload and

281
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,880
disappear

282
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,000
which means that the the content is

283
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,880
genuinely

284
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,680
a product is from all the chunks of your

285
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,959
content

286
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,360
travel to the network where they are

287
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,560
retrieved and found

288
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,839
according to as i

289
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,079
explained before the other important

290
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,600
difference is that

291
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,720
the swarm uses for its routing

292
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
kind of relayed pattern so basically it

293
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
it uses nodes to to forward uh

294
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,160
requests and and therefore as

295
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,880
very strong privacy properties so

296
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,839
because of the

297
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,120
ambiguity of where requests sorry

298
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,399
it kind of implements a mixed type of

299
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
uh

300
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,880
and based on this system we also have a

301
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,199
very strong value proposition

302
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,399
protocol which uses the

303
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,800
this this this fact that that

304
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,120
when you upload certain data on oneness

305
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,000
the data travels from one part of the

306
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,800
network

307
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,399
together this is chunk data is basically

308
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,760
a disguise and allows for

309
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,320
completely untraceable because it's zero

310
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,279
week communication which

311
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,480
sure within 20 encryption uh private and

312
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,240
anonymous based on the the ambiguity of

313
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,279
the forwarding

314
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,079
but also in a way does not leak

315
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,800
that a message is sent so it allows

316
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,240
completely dark

317
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,959
communication and then there's that's a

318
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,440
very

319
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,079
strong very proposition i don't know

320
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,279
apparently any

321
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,199
any system which has a strong

322
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,800
protocol so

323
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,719
most importantly the

324
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,000
incentivization is what uh ultimately

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,959
holds the

326
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,440
was the system together we are very

327
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
careful in designing

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,240
gifts so that basically every protocol

329
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,120
behavior of the client's moods

330
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,160
is supported by by

331
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,040
by the incentives in a way that's

332
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,240
aligned

333
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,959
with the incentives in the sense that

334
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,320
it's

335
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,480
either costly or where i tried

336
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,680
fatal and detrimental to any club

337
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,800
to depart to to

338
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,360
me and and

339
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
to optimize the resource allocation

340
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,240
so allocation of this space and and

341
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,680
and bandwidth so

342
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,000
so now now uh i talk a little bit about

343
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,359
why why i think this this this makes a

344
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,599
big difference and why this is the next

345
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,720
stage

346
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,439
of of technological innovation which is

347
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,119
relevant in

348
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,760
in the in the current digital age

349
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,720
so i i i could this approach

350
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,240
open resource because i want to

351
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,960
compare it or juxtapose it to the open

352
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,480
source movement

353
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,919
so open source uh

354
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,400
already

355
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,960
prove that

356
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,760
basically open source

357
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,760
to for for for software code to leverage

358
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,799
the whole community of global community

359
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,080
of developers

360
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,120
to continue their their their physics

361
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,240
and their features to code

362
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,640
and and ultimately this this

363
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,919
this paradigm contributed to to major

364
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,440
improvements in security stability and

365
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
and and feature set of software

366
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,440
applications

367
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,480
i have and and you know so

368
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,200
the tools that that made it possible to

369
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,000
to

370
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,280
to help the

371
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,240
version control different versions and

372
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,480
and

373
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,919
and and resubmit uh changes to

374
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,880
to the quad's origin maybe i made a huge

375
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,760
and

376
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,039
making this happen however

377
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,480
even if you you can modify code and

378
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,120
for open source code

379
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,880
it's difficult to to

380
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,039
to actually make sure that your

381
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,720
your your point can or

382
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
or even if you make a modification to an

383
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,559
application it's ever going to be used

384
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:36,960
because

385
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,640
it's still in the hands of the of the of

386
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,960
of of usually separate entities

387
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,559
to to take care of deploying and

388
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,320
and and run the applications

389
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,360
uh with this this model of

390
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,880
of the of the internet

391
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,159
in general this one being the

392
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,000
the the web stack for for

393
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,039
the f3 it's this

394
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,000
this situation changes quite radically

395
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,320
because

396
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,200
it's not only code that you can fork but

397
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,720
actually you can fold the application

398
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,080
itself

399
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,240
uh you you the the the very platform

400
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,559
that

401
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,600
was was the code and was the

402
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,960
asset that that

403
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,840
referred in

404
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,400
with both data and code hosted in the

405
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,080
same environment that

406
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,399
actually

407
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
of

408
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,120
you see the incentives the

409
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,559
burden of of running and deploying

410
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,280
and then maintaining an application and

411
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
scaling it

412
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,280
most importantly is is shifted the

413
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,400
burden of this is

414
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,480
shifted to the user that that slight

415
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,520
subtle economic difference makes

416
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,440
makes a world of a difference in in

417
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,840
terms of its uh its potential

418
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,760
its potential because because now it

419
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,158
means that

420
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,840
businesses that develop and improve

421
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,879
what an existing code can basically

422
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,559
they don't have to put up upfront

423
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,760
capital investment

424
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,120
and they're not

425
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,520
forced to have even necessarily

426
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,640
or in any other way do

427
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,840
financial prognosis and and therefore

428
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,159
the

429
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,760
the barrier of entry with these

430
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,280
businesses is

431
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,799
radically reduced uh i i can't

432
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,720
argue that this this seemingly mundane

433
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,640
uh difference in basically open that

434
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,280
open up the infrastructure resources

435
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
having permission

436
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,720
content and

437
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,159
where the cost is is born by the by the

438
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,200
users

439
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,080
makes a big difference in the dynamics

440
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,039
of

441
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,240
applications i developed it i

442
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,159
argued that that by doing this

443
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,520
basically both with

444
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,760
the feedback loop between the

445
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,039
applications users and

446
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,960
and the developers is

447
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,480
is accelerated as well as

448
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,080
testing and and and

449
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,280
and basically testing and quality

450
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,159
assurance

451
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,880
becomes becomes also more readily

452
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,320
available

453
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,840
and and i said

454
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,799
killing costs and then the running cost

455
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,679
of them

456
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,880
does not do not burden

457
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,600
the change it also impacts the

458
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,960
deployment in various

459
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,559
impacts from uh

460
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,679
from one application to the other

461
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,159
this also relates to the to the

462
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,600
which which is the the sovereignty of

463
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,880
of personal data this

464
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,840
this paradigm suits much better the

465
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,840
the the approach where where

466
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,360
applications like that when i use this

467
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,799
personal data

468
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,880
i kind of asking us permissions and just

469
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,279
the data otherwise under the person's

470
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,000
control

471
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,159
so instead of data silos you will have

472
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,600
personal data votes

473
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,279
with wallets and and

474
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,559
almost like like in your in your

475
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,039
mobile application you give or

476
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,640
an app you you basically

477
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,000
give give you permission to to

478
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,360
to an app to access your your your uh

479
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,760
your data and and um

480
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,799
together together with the uh with this

481
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,559
kind of paradigm of

482
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,919
of zero data apps and

483
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,520
and and then yeah the paradigm of open

484
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,120
uh basically uh i i predict that

485
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,360
the the last battle neck

486
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,480
of for um

487
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,760
um for

488
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,200
truly application uh development

489
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,720
is until then

490
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,880
and therefore i i believe that you're

491
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,320
gonna see a

492
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,440
it can be an explosion of of uh

493
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,360
of a few maps based on the battery uh

494
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,000
primitives

495
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,120
and that's the paradigm and and also a

496
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,760
corresponding improvement in in

497
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,799
in in in usability and

498
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,600
and in in

499
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,679
of certain productivity applications

500
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,039
it also has the promise to bring a new

501
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,120
area of interoperability

502
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,640
because uh what the code that's

503
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,360
that's necessary to to to find deploying

504
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,640
applications

505
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,279
is is going to be in the same system and

506
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,039
it's it's it's it's enforcing uh

507
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,480
the standardization of ap uh uh on

508
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
where it encourages and incentivizes the

509
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,600
standardization of

510
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,760
apis to across application

511
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,120
in the sense that the blockchain does

512
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,039
already but

513
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,120
also including other components like

514
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,679
like like messaging like like like

515
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,400
storage and

516
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,840
in general and data manipulation

517
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,279
but uh what maybe i i also want to say

518
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,640
is that

519
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,240
uh this one swarm and this

520
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,600
the blockchain as i as i said before too

521
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,640
to complete the

522
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,880
view of the worst computer so in other

523
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,559
ways uh helps

524
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,760
scaling scaling blockchains in in

525
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,880
in two ways basically first first first

526
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,520
directly the current infrastructure can

527
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,640
be have by

528
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,000
by uh putting the the ethereum

529
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,760
state and and and

530
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,840
the the way uh ethereum nodes

531
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,799
do syncing or or directly

532
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,039
serve serve light nodes

533
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,919
basically act as lights which provide

534
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,320
the pieces according to the light light

535
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,159
client protocol

536
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,440
and uh

537
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,159
and thirdly also to to to provide

538
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,720
an api for for for decentralized

539
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,600
explorer

540
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,640
so let's just forget that it's a bit

541
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,159
still weird that that we use the

542
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,679
centralized

543
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,360
uh uh explorers to look at our

544
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,080
transactions on the ethereum blockchains

545
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,279
it's not necessary if if

546
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,880
if someone is used properly to host this

547
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,240
uh this data

548
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,399
and then this

549
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,480
will be provided as the back end to

550
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,919
decentralized

551
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,200
explorers and on the other hand this

552
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
uh makes it possible to to to

553
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,600
provide the the secure

554
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,440
communication and data transfer layers

555
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,120
for for

556
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,240
uh off chain computation so

557
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,880
so i predict that that instead of

558
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,320
instead of sharding

559
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,080
another paradigm is going to emerge

560
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,399
which is

561
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,080
through b10 and uh and the

562
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,799
other kind of provable of chain and

563
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,080
computation

564
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,320
uh

565
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,600
solutions uh basically that allows

566
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,799
arbitrary virtualization or arbitrary

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,799
are done by

570
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,840
by individual nodes and in the off-chain

571
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,120
verified

572
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,879
manner and then which parts

573
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,600
yet get into a full consensus

574
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,200
and and uh they actually have ever

575
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,399
have a direct

576
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,960
execution in the blockchain bible by one

by one nodes

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,000
and um

579
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,120
with this i i predict that if this

580
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,080
if this becomes kind of smooth

581
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,440
to provide basically infinitely scalable

computation infinitely scalable

583
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,600
data i mean even in back to the to the

584
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,039
network size but

585
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,679
but in a sense it's not constrained by

586
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,200
fire

587
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,640
by any other

588
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,919
uh so by providing this this this this

589
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,120
framework to do

590
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,158
the scalable computation and and then

591
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,480
and having the possibility of private

592
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,520
and

593
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,799
and untraceable communication i believe

594
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,039
that

595
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,158
this will

596
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,840
this will bring

use of the content of the computation

would be

uh

603
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,279

consensus is

608
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,320
is required yeah so for example but not

609
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,840
every facebook like

610
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,720
but we need to go through the blockchain

personal demographic data

history

620
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,240
together with your with your uh usage or

621
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,279
your facebook like and then as a

622
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,880
consequence you can also

623
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,080
capitalize on this on these uh

627
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
is it so

um

629
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,159
oh can you hear us now yeah i can

630
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,840
hear you now

631
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,399
so just a second

632
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,678
hi

633
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
so

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,840
infrastructure layer

635
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,360
can you maybe repeat a question like can

636
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,639
you repeat the question joseph

637
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,879
so if you know about this

638
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,320
compared to the could you hear it now

639
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,760
yes yes

640
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,960
i i i know i know about dfinity i'm not

641
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,480
um

642
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,639
yes see i'm not completely privy

643
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,280
uh into the attack itself so i don't

644
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,440
know how solid their proposition is

645
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,199
but but if for the what they say is

646
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,320
is true then they they they

647
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,079
truly realize something in the in the

648
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,960
in the same spirit as soon so they i

649
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,480
think i think they're

650
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,599
the proposition isn't very close and

651
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,159
if it's all if it's all uh

652
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,920
like what

653
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,079
thinking about the internet

654
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,680
i also wanted to um

655
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,079
okay what would you where what would you

656
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,560
recommend

657
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,160
diving deep into sports

658
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,759
so i i can't hear anything

659
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,440
this is completely breaking up

660
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,839
question the question was what would be

661
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,280
the first thing

662
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,599
to do

663
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,040
i heard only half of what you said yes

664
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,560
you said like what would be the first

665
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,720
thing

666
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,359
so so swami is now

667
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,319
as seriously

668
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,160
far ahead with

669
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,079
which is clear

670
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,440
where the grid

671
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,839
is using the serial maintenance so so

672
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,839
summary of what

673
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,520
and then try out our features and give

674
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:19,839
us feedback
