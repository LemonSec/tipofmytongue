00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,200
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,920
good afternoon

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,840
first of all i want to thank

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,039
parallel police institute for

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,560
of cryptography

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,960
anarchy i love them

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,519
but i don't belong here i am

8
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,079
too old uh to learn new things

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,559
as much as i love them i love to be

10
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,360
curious

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,200
but some things are beyond my

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,480
comprehension

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,079
like bitcoin for instance i never

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,120
had a crown spur to invest so

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,600
i i'm not going to talk about that as

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
well

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,440
my qualification to speak here is

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,480
scaffold i am a dissident

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,680
and i learned through years that

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,319
once you embrace that kind of career

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,040
it's forever

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,439
no government will ever be pleased with

23
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,119
me

24
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,159
and i am proud of

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,560
being

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,400
sword and

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,040
disliked by all the prime ministers

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,320
since the fall of communism

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,279
it's a great pride

30
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,520
second i apologize for not being tidy

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,640
i made a promise to my wife we will

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,280
celebrate

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
joint

34
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,240
anniversary she'll be 60 and i'll be 70

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,600
next march and she wants to see me with

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,960
a beard

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,479
and a ponytail so i started to grow a

38
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,679
beard and a ponytail

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,360
um i'll be rewarded for that

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,960
i will be allowed to jump with the

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,840
parachute again

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,399
so

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,879
being 70 means that you remember a lot

44
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,720
i had a grateful life so far

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,200
and i remember a horse carried

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,239
postal wagons in streets of prague

47
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,720
we loved it as kids i remember steam

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,879
locomotives

49
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,080
i remember the first uh

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
men on orbit euro gergarin

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
i remember first men on the moon i

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
remember that number

53
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,840
assassination of of uh john fitzgerald

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,599
kennedy his brother

55
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,560
martin luther king

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,599
i remember wars jails

57
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
and all this in

58
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,000
not even 70 years

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,599
that's how times are running fast these

60
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,440
days

61
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,519
and what we believe is history is with

62
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,200
us

63
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,958
and i am a living testimony to that

64
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,280
i brought something heavy

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
anybody who would recognize it

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,000
this is one of the first yes

67
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,950
[Laughter]

68
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
no no not really uh this is one of the

69
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
first laptop computers

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
brought into czechoslovakia in

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,439
june 1989. it was a generous gift

72
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,080
from one american university to

73
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,879
us czechoslovakians and

74
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,840
i have done some damage to the regime i

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,480
hope

76
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,358
it's proverbial toshiba's t-1600

77
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,400
pass it around please so that you see

78
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,479
what it meant a laptop computer

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,120
uh comedy secret police didn't like it

80
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,880
and they were so unqualified that they

81
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
confiscated it uh the night that i

82
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,320
brought it home

83
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,800
from the customs before i was even able

84
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
to

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,199
to upload the czech alphabet

86
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,360
into it so i couldn't have committed any

87
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
thought crime yet

88
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,600
so eventually they had to give it back

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,560
i keep it with me as a reminder of the

90
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
times

91
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,000
constantly changing and

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,560
i would love to find somebody who could

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,759
bring it back to life because it's dead

94
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,880
already it's heavy

95
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,400
and i i love to remember that

96
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,160
i was able to run with it in the sandals

97
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,039
away from secret police

98
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,080
but that's uh not what i want to talk

99
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,320
about today this is just an illustration

100
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,000
it's only 10 generations

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
between industrial revolution and now

102
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,680
my question is have we learned the

103
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,440
lesson

104
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,639
from the most dramatic change

105
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,919
in human history because industrial

106
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,639
revolution changed everything

107
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,800
but most importantly it has changed

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,840
our identity human identity

109
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,280
because we were made

110
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,639
to live in in local communities

111
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,800
in regional communities and our identity

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,440
was to be from somewhere

113
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,720
and to be forced something

114
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
thanks to industrial revolution

115
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,039
uh out of a sudden

116
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,840
specifically talking about europe

117
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
we are out of a sudden

118
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,199
made citizen of a nation-state

119
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
and that's a horrifying

120
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,880
structure because you are identified by

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,800
a language

122
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,919
you are obliged to be one nation

123
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,319
defined by that language and you have

124
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,160
the government

125
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,680
acquiring more and more control

126
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,360
over every individual and every identity

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,520
every region from that time on

128
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,199
our identity is to be against somebody

129
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,840
against anybody who is not with us

130
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,319
that's a historical breakthrough

131
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,919
welcome ten generations as i said mere

132
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,198
10 generations

133
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,880
and only now i hope we can

134
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,960
see thanks to technical innovations

135
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,319
a possibility to cut through the borders

136
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,479
the same way we've been able to cut

137
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,080
barbed wire

138
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,840
on the borders of communist bloc

139
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,759
and to create maybe not regents

140
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,039
but uh

141
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,560
collectives or or social groups of

142
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,759
like-minded people

143
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,960
be it no no i love it

144
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,680
uh be it uh uh around kryptonarchy or

145
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,319
bitcoin i don't care

146
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,639
people who do not need

147
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,120
their governments to tell them who they

148
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,240
are

149
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,599
that was always my dream

150
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,799
um

151
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,080
i'm so old-fashioned that i

152
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,599
have to read it yeah

153
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,839
but

154
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,120
the geniuses of

155
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,240
industrial revolution

156
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,680
mechanics and engineers had great

157
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,279
dreams about how

158
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,760
technical innovation will change

159
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,600
human life will bring

160
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,880
more education to more people will bring

161
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,680
more people

162
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,959
into the cities and with it better

163
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,680
health care

164
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,600
life was supposed to be great

165
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
and to a certain extent extent it

166
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,440
definitely happened

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,839
uh longer life

168
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,440
expectancy better health care sooner or

169
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
later

170
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,399
uh we were even aboli we were even able

171
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,760
to abolish child labor

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,240
on a way we gave women voting rights

173
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,279
around 1900

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,240
some countries invented

175
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,360
social care health system

176
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,440
on a baby also found sports

177
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,399
and entertainment

178
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,839
great cultural change

179
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,360
who would have thought that pop idols

180
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,480
will be dictating the norms of behavior

181
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,680
fashion and political thinking

182
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,560
films film stars and so on so on so on

183
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,279
but the whole question is

184
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,839
what has gone wrong because in short

185
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,440
retrospect uh

186
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,519
what followed the formation of nation

187
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
states was more conflicts

188
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,959
more wars anti-semitism

189
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,800
two world wars this concentration camps

190
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,959
and gas chambers

191
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,720
totalitarian regimes ruling over

192
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,079
more than a billion people

193
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,279
the states the governments have acquired

194
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:11,920
more

195
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,880
and more control over individual

196
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,519
people's lives

197
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,399
the exact opposite of what the dreamers

198
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:20,720
of

199
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,920
industrial revolution dreamt about

200
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,440
and it seems as if we are at the same

201
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,120
crossroad these days

202
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,040
because so-called information revolution

203
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,519
digital revolution

204
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,120
is bringing with it

205
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,399
equally great dreams

206
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,920
are we up to fulfilling them or

207
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,200
will we allow the government

208
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,680
nation state governments to dictate

209
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,040
who is able to control

210
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,680
and how much control we are willing to

211
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,399
to give our governments over our lives

212
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,079
our economies

213
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,880
our well-being

214
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,440
so to me as a historian the question is

215
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,000
are we able to learn from the mistakes

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
of the past

217
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,760
my answer to that is i don't know

218
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,320
i'm looking around for hopeful signs

219
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,320
like your gatherings and ideas

220
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,600
and i'm worried about

221
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,120
the willingness with which the societies

222
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,920
are

223
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,000
are freely giving out their freedoms

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,920
uh allowing the facial

225
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,600
recognition uh being used in the cities

226
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:07,839
and so on so and so on

227
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,680
the 20th century have brought only

228
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,440
two three new elements into the four

229
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,200
uh we have tested

230
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,839
uh totalitarian experience of

231
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,880
militarized

232
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,240
totally centralized state control over

233
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,720
the society

234
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,680
later on uh we have embraced consumption

235
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,360
society

236
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,399
and uh still later

237
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,000
information explosion

238
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,360
but uh was this

239
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,880
came a recognition of

240
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,600
what is nation state because nation

241
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,360
state

242
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,839
is the uh the birth bet of modern

243
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,560
nationalism

244
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,800
i talked about that identity for

245
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,920
something

246
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,639
being from somewhere and you are for

247
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,839
something

248
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
but now uh we are destined or

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,160
taught by our governments

250
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,199
until recently to be against

251
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,839
somebody

252
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,600
the czechs have eternal problem

253
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,320
we still don't know who the hell we are

254
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,839
if we cross out our enemies

255
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,120
or spectres behind the borders

256
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,880
we don't have positive mission

257
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,959
who the hell are we i'm check

258
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,480
because i'm not german american

259
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,839
russian very strange

260
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,959
for a book i am preparing i i made

261
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,119
dozens of interviews and i asked

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,560
the people

263
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
who are we

264
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,600
why why is it good to be czech

265
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,639
and the most frequent uh frequent answer

266
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,279
i got well because we are not germans

267
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,040
hey i'm a pigeon because i'm not a fox

268
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,839
something strange here

269
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
so

270
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,000
this changed identity very complex

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,759
and and complete uh

272
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,680
is with us and we tend to believe

273
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,079
that it is unsolvable that it is with us

274
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,719
uh since eternity not true

275
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,720
this is today's form of forms of

276
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,519
nationalism

277
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,800
are 19th century invention

278
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,399
and they are

279
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
products of so-called

280
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
politics of cultural

281
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,399
it will come i promise a cultural

282
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,399
despair

283
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,079
a wonderful book about 19th century

284
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,240
germany a germanic thought

285
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,519
by fritz stern

286
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,440
my colleague from new york university

287
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,279
one of the best books explaining

288
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,720
the modern history of europe

289
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,880
you lose your culture you lose your

290
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,399
identity you lose

291
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,440
who you are and you

292
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,919
embrace state imposed

293
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,319
nation thought nationalism instead

294
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,039
what follow we have mentioned

295
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,959
if two-world wars is not enough or are

296
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,559
not enough

297
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,400
to learn the lesson then what is

298
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
and still you have idiots

299
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
in all our societies who want to exclude

300
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,679
people of color people of different

301
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,960
thought people this

302
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,280
that

303
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,120
uh the czech form of idiots

304
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,439
screams ch checkland studio checks

305
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,600
genetic research proves that 95 percent

306
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,559
of checks

307
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,760
are not checks but who cares

308
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,720
the biggest national czech nationalist

309
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,640
on our political scene

310
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,160
is half japanese and so on so on so on

311
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
uh

312
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,080
the crossroad i mentioned

313
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,679
is the misuse

314
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,520
of information technologies

315
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,240
to me the most dangerous

316
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,200
dream for future are the techniques

317
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,760
uh tested used misused

318
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,240
and connected to the names of cambridge

319
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,840
analytica

320
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
uh

321
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,960
beautiful dreams about parliamentary

322
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,720
representative democracy

323
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,880
uh are connected uh with the notion of

324
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,039
democracy being

325
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,640
the right of informed voters

326
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
rational making rational decisions about

327
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,799
their representation

328
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,160
what we see in the last 50 years in

329
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,200
with more and more

330
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,400
clarity is that we are the viewers

331
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,280
of what is decisive force in today's

332
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,360
classic democratic politics

333
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,960
are are uninformed

334
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,520
television viewers or social media users

335
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,679
uh concentrating on on emotions

336
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,120
solely i don't call it democracy anymore

337
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,840
but i don't have anything to replace it

338
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
with

339
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,640
so i'm just screaming biburr

340
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,000
atomization of our more and more

341
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,679
polarized society

342
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,720
mentioned by the speaker before me

343
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,679
ironically it is all hailed by new

344
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,640
technologies

345
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,240
starting with television and new media

346
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,559
and

347
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,840
programming of voter response i i just

348
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,640
love

349
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,280
the stupidity and immorality of this

350
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
term

351
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,520
i read read some some books and articles

352
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:37,919
about

353
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,960
cambridge analytica and the guys using

354
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,039
it or creating it

355
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,120
freely confessed to

356
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,400
look for being able to to

357
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,520
format voter

358
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,158
behavior

359
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,159
to me that's frightening

360
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
uh

361
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,280
for me

362
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,280
as i think i made it clear

363
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,559
the concept very strong

364
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,120
in europe and and combined around the

365
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,159
globe

366
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,640
of a nation-state is

367
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,400
is the biggest danger

368
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,600
first of all because nation states

369
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,799
have totally destroyed and wiped out

370
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,720
what was through enlightenment and

371
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
early industrial revolution the most

372
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,799
important social group

373
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,400
that i call the communicators

374
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,640
the people of different professions uh

375
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,640
uh for whom

376
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,080
the language was not

377
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,679
the divisive element

378
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,799
but was a tool of communication merely

379
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,760
that

380
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,120
people who spoke freely several

381
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,000
languages

382
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,679
as it was so frequent

383
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,640
in in specifically central europe with

384
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,039
multi-ethnic history

385
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,919
that ended only in 1945

386
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,320
my grandfather was one of them

387
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,360
he was totally bilingual

388
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,320
czech and german for him

389
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,440
there was no difference it was just two

390
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,679
languages that he used

391
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,720
uh as as kids we always

392
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
used to run to him in the morning and

393
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,480
and asking

394
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,960
you know in what language did you dream

395
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,559
tonight

396
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,159
and i'm sure he lied and he was

397
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,080
inventing stories but

398
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,480
but it was part of a great game

399
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,320
uh

400
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,240
once we made the language

401
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,880
uh the obligation

402
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,240
and the only decisive mark for

403
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
our national identity

404
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,200
where was the rest of the quality

405
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,559
there was morality there was political

406
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,280
opinion

407
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
it was cultural background there was

408
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,120
regional roots

409
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,320
and it was just the beginning

410
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,600
of wars expulsions

411
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,919
you may know that three million germans

412
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,200
were

413
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
forcefully expelled from this country

414
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,799
who lived here for 800 years

415
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,640
and some of us who

416
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,679
who dare to write about it

417
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,240
in these days are still getting death

418
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,000
threats

419
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,360
a friend of mine who wrote a book about

420
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,960
it

421
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,840
had a bomb explode in front of his house

422
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,840
and that's 2020.

423
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
so

424
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,400
information revolution information

425
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,760
breaks through and change is a time of

426
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,080
new

427
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,600
dreams and my dream would be

428
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,279
that hey out of a sudden we have a

429
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,159
chance to

430
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,520
break through the barriers

431
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,600
maybe it's not about settling the

432
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,440
like-minded people

433
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,679
in in one region to get back to this

434
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,640
i belong somewhere because of

435
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,159
new techniques new technologies we can

436
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,039
contact and come communicate with

437
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,480
like-minded

438
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,760
open people uh around the world

439
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,559
literally

440
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,760
and

441
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,159
to me when i watch the nation states

442
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,440
hating this that's a proof of quality

443
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,559
so continue contacting

444
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,039
continue conspiring continue to break

445
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,720
uh through the barriers to me

446
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,679
as a former anti-communist dissident

447
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,240
it's

448
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,320
it's quite moving that the prague

449
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,320
parallel police uh has chosen

450
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,679
the slogan and ideas of my friend vasa

451
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,039
bender

452
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,640
who back in the 70s has proposed this

453
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,000
idea that

454
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,400
okay i don't like the regime so why

455
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,440
don't we create

456
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,720
parallel polish parallel society

457
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,159
we never made it frankly

458
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,840
uh we were

459
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,039
haunted animals

460
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,120
so take

461
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,960
and use that wonderful term as you wish

462
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,039
but look for other examples

463
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,960
and i would suggest at the end of my

464
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,440
talk i promise

465
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,039
that uh

466
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,200
i was working in different war conflicts

467
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,159
after 89 and also in kosovo

468
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,159
look at ibrahimovic

469
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,279
the literature professor who was able

470
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,559
to create

471
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,679
truly working parallel society to

472
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,279
to serbian military domination

473
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,679
they were able to create independent

474
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,640
schooling

475
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,520
independent healthcare and for several

476
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,320
years

477
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,480
we were able to keep a non-violent

478
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,440
resistance admirable

479
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,640
it's only when we

480
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,600
in the best have betrayed the cause and

481
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,279
sold them out in in dayton peace accord

482
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,399
so uh regular lost

483
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,880
because uh younger and more aggressive

484
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,000
elements have opted for

485
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,120
armed struggle nevertheless

486
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,039
this is the example to follow my wish

487
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,480
for your activities would be

488
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,520
look into the possibility of creating

489
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,158
international university

490
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,480
maybe it can be online

491
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,320
but education is the key create

492
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,480
your followers and

493
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,919
in my opinion that would be the way

494
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,840
to follow thank you very much

495

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,720
and you you spoke a lot about the

507
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
identity and there's a bird

508
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,679
hanging around a lot and my question is

509
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,480
how would you

510
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,120
define the identity in relationship to

511
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,360
uh to an individual

512
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,600
and also in a relationship to a

513
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,640
community meaning

514
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,600
what is according to you an identity of

515
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,720
the individual

516
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,039
and the identity of a community how

517
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,840
would you define that

518
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,480
that's the question of my life

519
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:26,399
i have no uh one answer

520
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,600
on individual level

521
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,480
identity means that

522
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,679
you can talk to yourself and to people

523
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,840
near to you

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,039
khali aspers wrote about it

525
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,640
many decades ago

526
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,080
and if not being proud

527
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,480
[Music]

528
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,799
at least to feel that you haven't lost

529
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,840
people around you because of your

530
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,159
mistakes

531
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,440
above that if you are able to uh

532
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,600
to

533
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,080
get a feeling of belonging to

534
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,639
community

535
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,120
which for me is extremely difficult

536
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,840
but i would think that this is the way

537
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,080
it's not that you agree all the time

538
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,880
but it's about respecting

539
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,840
disagreement and still being together

540
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,918
i i was 26 when i was

541
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,960
kicked out from my job because of

542
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,559
being disloyal to the regime

543
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,840
and at that time i lived in an

544
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,120
in a city of 11 000 inhabitants

545
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,719
everybody knew everybody else

546
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,919
and people whom i took for friends until

547
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,159
then

548
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,799
they're crossing to the other side of

549
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,480
the street so they wouldn't be

550
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,720
seen talking to me or meeting with me

551
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
and

552
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,200
in a way for for most of my

553
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,799
life this state to me

554
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,440
um

555
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,519
in a in a manner that i do not want

556
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,240
to belong to somebody

557
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,399
i want that respect i want to give

558
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,880
respect

559
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,200
and i definitely don't want to be judged

560
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,240
and valued

561
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,360
by my language

562
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,240
i i teach in in one of the best

563
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,080
universities

564
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,120
in the world as i believe

565
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,399
i don't have even check doctorate

566
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,360
and and czech universities universities

567
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,960
regard me as controversial

568
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,640
uh so uh

569
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,600
maybe it's just i don't like checks no i

570
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,080
don't know

571
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,519
i love being czech but you know i hate

572
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,880
lying about own history i don't know if

573
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,519
i answered

574
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,279
anything

575
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,519
okay we have another question

576
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,200
thank you for your talk i would like to

577
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,519
ask question if you

578
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,039
if you believe or think that the

579
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,880
future uh the future of society

580
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,880
without a state is a possibility not

581
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,000
and maybe you can give us how

582
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,720
much of a possibility it is maybe in

583
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,840
percentage or something thank you

584
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,600
i don't think we'll get rid of the

585
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,760
states

586
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,279
i my hope would be that

587
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,519
we will be able to create collectives

588
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,880
large enough

589
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,640
to uh to live uh

590
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,880
outside of state super control

591
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,320
uh bringing its

592
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,159
own code of morality its own

593
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,039
uh trustworthiness and truth

594
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,399
uh what i really dislike

595
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,760
in this 200 years

596
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,960
since the formation of nation states

597
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,320
is that we

598
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,840
have to believe in state given

599
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,440
history in my country's

600
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,520
respect ninety percent of its

601
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,599
is blood and lie

602
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,520
we adore presidents

603
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,719
who were war criminals

604
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,199
i have found documents proving that

605
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,679
president banish our postal

606
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,800
hero he betrayed the country

607
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,839
on on numerous occasions

608
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,480
and uh opened the gate for the communist

609
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,839
coup d'etat

610
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,239
he was in 45 not only that he prevented

611
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,839
his opponents from coming back from

612
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,239
exile

613
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,280
but he even personally ordered

614
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,199
jailing of their wives and kids

615
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,719
and i'm supposed to believe it was a

616
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,119
democrat

617
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,800
no way so

618
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,160
you know widening the space for

619
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,280
independence

620
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,160
is my dream

621
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,000
but for reasons of

622
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,280
tradition taxation military

623
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,960
security i am afraid we will

624
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,280
have to deal with the state structures

625
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,560
still for some time

626
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,839
do you have more questions

627
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,320
thank you very much i have two hands so

628
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,160
i could have two microphones in actual

629
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,640
fact

630
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,240
but i only have one mouth which is

631
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,000
probably a good idea

632
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,160
um there are three parts this one is

633
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,119
simple one

634
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,640
do you have a floppy disk for your

635
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,280
computer i do

636
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,599
uh that's worth a lot of money as well

637
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,599
uh and how many people in this audience

638
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,119
have actually seen a floppy disk which

639
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,119
is a very interesting one

640
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,119
the serious question uh the cambridge

641
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,160
analytica

642
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,599
um very scary it is as you say

643
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,920
i think it also is just one

644
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,119
demonstration

645
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,359
of many actions that are going on around

646
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,240
the world

647
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,320
um but they're actually actions which

648
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,599
are um

649
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,400
perpetrated by individuals who know the

650
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,119
power

651
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,160
of i.t and they want to influence

652
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,200
but they're not states as such

653
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,560
they're individuals with their own

654
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,640
agendas so that in fact

655
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,839
is something which goes against what is

656
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:38,160
in

657
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,880
in your favor which is saying that

658
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,520
states

659
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,160
should not control us all that's the

660
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,200
second part of it

661
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,480
sorry and the last part is something

662
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,200
that's right

663
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,040
right in front of us which is the use of

664
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,320
the mask and the belief

665
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,839
of kovid and the instructions from state

666
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,200
to wear masks etc etc and your opinions

667
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,760
upon

668
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,560
that as well if i may thank you

669
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,839
first of all as a historian

670
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,599
you don't have many safe bets but one is

671
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,800
sure and save there is

672
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,040
no example

673
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,400
which would show the state

674
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,680
not being the first to

675
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,280
misuse new technologies

676
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,640
since industrial revolution and the same

677
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,119
goes

678
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,800
for for acquiring more and more control

679
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,760
the states are always advanced party

680
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,960
to the use of new technology it's all

681
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,440
dangers attached

682
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,680
and about covet

683
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,640
you know i'm

684
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,640
my friend has it and is

685
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,720
in quite serious state

686
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,800
and it's not only because of him that i

687
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,280
take it seriously but at the same time

688
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,720
this is not new we've had

689
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,160
pandemics before we are much better

690
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,320
equipped

691
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,680
from moral standpoint unfortunately

692
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,839
we don't have other structures than the

693
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,400
state

694
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,480
to tell us what to do and as usually the

695
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,440
states the governments are overdoing it

696
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,280
in my opinion you know 200 years ago to

697
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,400
read the church

698
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,680
uh now we have our governments with all

699
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,599
their experts and ministries

700
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,720
and science and statistics and whatever

701
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,920
modeling uh computer modeling and

702
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,800
whatever

703
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,720
let them do their work but

704
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,599
the minute i have i'll have a sense that

705
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,079
they are

706
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,240
stepping on my freedom

707
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,920
and it's not about you know covering my

708
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,359
mouth or whatever

709
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,079
but limiting information exchange or

710
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,960
or hiding information i'll scream

711
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,560
because that's my basic freedom

712
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,480
i'm not if i'm satisfied

713
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,839
uh yes

714
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,599
thank you very much i mean anything you

715
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,880
say is very interesting

716
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,280
uh um i happen to come from the uk

717
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,000
although i live

718
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,920
in prague for and this is my home for

719
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,240
seven years um

720
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,079
and so i have a a slightly different

721
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,400
view on certain things which is

722
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,440
complementary

723
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,839
in many ways so i thank you and there's

724
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,280
nothing else i need to say

725
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,880
at this moment in time i hand it to

726
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:11,839
somebody else so thank you very much
