1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,570
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,640
all right

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,240
fine so my subject is strong privacy

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,200
and reputational enforcement and i want

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,200
to start by saying a little bit about

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
the technology

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,880
not very much i assume many of you are

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,039
familiar with it and some of you are not

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,359
but the underlying technology is public

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,640
key encryption

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,439
and that is a mathematical process that

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,679
produces a pair of keys

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,120
each a long number such that

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,559
what one key scrambles the other key is

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,160
needed to descramble

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,680
so if i scramble a message with key a

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,160
key a will not descramble it but key b

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,719
will

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,000
and the same thing in the other

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,480
direction

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,480
what i then do is to make one of the

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,600
keys public

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,239
so-called public key and keep the other

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,920
very private

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,320
now if you want to send me a message you

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,079
encrypt it with my public key which

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,760
everybody knows

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,600
other people with my public key still

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
can't read it

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,920
they can only send me messages too i

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,720
decrypt it within my private key

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,119
if i want to prove a message is from me

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,159
i encrypt it with my private key

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,320
you decrypt it with my public key and

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,759
the fact that what you get is not

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,720
gibberish

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,560
proves that it was encrypted with the

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,320
matching private key therefore that it

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,600
must be from me

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,840
and part of what's important about that

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
is that that not only proves to you that

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,200
i sent the message

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,759
it proves it in a way i can't disown

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,520
that you can prove to any interested

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,479
third party

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,159
that i actually sent that message

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,600
because you have a message

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
encrypted with my private key which only

49
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,640
i have

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,200
that's the basic logic of this of

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,720
digital signatures

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,079
in practice there are lots of more

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,079
complicated things but that's the guts

54
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,280
of what it is

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,880
and of public key encryption for privacy

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,520
then the next question is how in this

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,240
system

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,479
do i make payments because to have a

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,240
functioning economy i have to have a way

60
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,000
of paying people money

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,680
and the answer is that i use an

62
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,840
anonymous digital

63
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
a version of that was brought up by a

64
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,239
dutch cryptographer david chalm

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,319
decades ago uh the newer version

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,200
is cryptocurrency uh each of them has

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
problems and if there's time i will

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,840
discuss that a little bit at the end

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,280
what does the resulting world look like

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,319
it's on an online world where

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,959
messages are entirely private anybody

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,800
can send a message to anybody that no

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,040
one else can read

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,360
where we have digital signatures so that

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,720
i can prove who i

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,080
am online without having to reveal any

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,160
information about my real space

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
identity anonymous digital cache of one

79
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
form or another for payments

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,959
and what's interesting it is now

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
possible to have both anonymity and

82
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,640
reputation

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,879
i could have reputation for my online

84
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,159
identity

85
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,000
without having to tell anyone what my

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,319
how old i am whether i'm male or female

87
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,400
or what continent i live on

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,959
very interesting combination and i've

89
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,080
discussed this

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,120
24 years ago in an article which you can

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,599
find

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,159
on my web page here it is

93
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,400
and

94
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,120
the the web yeah

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,799
the the web page uh is

96
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,599
daviddfriedman.com which is pretty easy

97
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,238
to remember

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,120
there are advantages and disadvantages

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,239
of this technology

100
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,959
like most technologies one of the

101
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,080
advantage

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
is that although it is still possible to

103
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,519
commit fraud online

104
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,080
it's not really possible to commit force

105
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,480
what we think of as force online hacking

106
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,519
into computers

107
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,280
is ultimately a form of fraud it

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
involves persuading your computer

109
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,959
that this is somebody it's supposed to

110
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,400
trust when it isn't

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
but you can't get a bullet through a t1

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
line so literal force is not an option

113
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,799
in the online world

114
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,080
although of course it still is in the

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,280
real space world on the other hand this

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
also means that you cannot use force to

117
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,879
enforce contracts

118
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,120
so that the court system the ordinary

119
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,358
court system in effect vanishes

120
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,440
you can't sue somebody if you do not

121
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,320
know anything about him

122
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
so you therefore need a different way of

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,000
enforcing agreements in order to have

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
a functioning economy online and the

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
way to do it i think the way i'll be

126
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,560
discussing today

127
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,160
is through reputation reputational

128
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
enforcement is a very interesting way in

129
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
enforcing things

130
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,240
and it has certain problems of its own

131
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,360
imagine that i

132
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
buy a suit the seller says money back if

133
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,240
you don't like it

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
i bring it home and my wife points out

135
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,400
that i'm not really a

136
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,759
40 tall but a 36 short

137
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,120
and that purple is not my color i take

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
it back

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
and in fact they give me my money back

140
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,919
and the question is why do they give me

141
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,919
my money back

142
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,320
they know that for a sum this small i am

143
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,639
not in fact going to sue them

144
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,720
however they also know that if they

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,479
don't give me my money back

146
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,880
not only will i not buy from them again

147
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,840
but i will tell

148
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
other people that they cannot be trusted

149
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,960
and they will lose

150
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,320
other customers and

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,880
that is a reason why they want to

152
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,919
maintain

153
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,560
their reputation the odd thing about

154
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,120
this

155
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,919
is that enforcement here is a byproduct

156
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,880
most

157
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,080
goods and services we get are produced

158
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,160
for their own sake if it's worth

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,520
producing to me

160
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
and costs less than what it's worth to

161
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,199
me to you you will produce it and make

162
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,320
money selling it to you

163
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,600
to me enforcement does not work that way

164
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
perhaps unfortunately because the other

165
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,039
people

166
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,680
who choose not to buy from the

167
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
department store

168
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,720
are not trying to punish the store

169
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
they're not trying to enforce my

170
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
contract

171
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,840
they are merely people who want

172
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,319
themselves not to be cheated

173
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,880
that they want therefore they're acting

174
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
for their own benefit

175
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
not for the purpose of enforcing the

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
contract enforcing the contract is as it

177
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
were a side effect

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
why is this a problem suppose that we

179
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,639
have a contract

180
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,360
you break it i tell everybody what you

181
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,759
did

182
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,080
and you of course deny it you claim that

183
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
i'm the one who didn't fulfill

184
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
my terms of the contract consider the

185
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,360
situation from the standpoint of a third

186
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,160
party

187
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
who has no way of knowing which of us is

188
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,960
lying his rational response is

189
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
one of the two is dishonest i'd rather

190
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,199
not deal with dishonest people there are

191
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,840
lots of honest people out there in the

192
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,639
world therefore

193
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,319
i should trust neither of the two

194
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,680
parties

195
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,000
sensible thing for him to do but a very

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
poor way of punishing breach

197
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,560
because now recognizing that i don't

198
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
report the breach because it'll only

199
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,120
hurt me

200
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,400
to do so so what that tells us

201
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,280
is that in reputational enforcement

202
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,479
breaks down

203
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,120
if the interested third parties cannot

204
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,080
easily

205
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,560
determine who is at fault that's the

206
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,039
problem we have to solve to make it work

207
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,360
as a substitute for a court system

208
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
online

209
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,599
how do we arrange that online

210
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,639
you and i agree to a contract we

211
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,039
digitally sign the contract

212
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,360
that means that each of us has a signed

213
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,120
copy which he can show to anybody else

214
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,960
to prove the other one signed it

215
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,520
and the contract includes the virtual

216
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,680
identity of the arbitrator

217
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,240
who we agree to judge the contract and

218
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
his public key

219
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,360
which is his critical identifier

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,080
you break the contract i ask for

221
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
arbitration

222
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,599
and the arbitrator concludes that you

223
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,680
are indeed at fault and owes me

224
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,960
ten thousand dollars you pay or you

225
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
don't pay

226
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,720
if you don't pay the arbitrator writes

227
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,759
up his verdict

228
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,319
the fact of your default you did not pay

229
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,919
according to his ruling

230
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,400
signs it using his private key and gives

231
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
me a copy

232
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,960
i now have the original contract which

233
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
you provably signed

234
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,280
the arbitrator's verdict signed by the

235
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,039
person who you agreed

236
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,080
would arbitrate the dispute i post that

237
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,599
online on the web or whatever the future

238
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,039
equivalent of the web is with tags

239
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,320
identifying you your public key

240
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,559
the name you do business online under

241
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,320
whatever else of that sort

242
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,200
is useful to find you anybody else who

243
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,600
is thinking of doing business with you

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,640
does a web search for information about

245
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,839
you

246
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,160
he finds what i have posted and at the

247
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,560
cost of a few seconds of computer time

248
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
checking the signatures he discovers

249
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
that you signed a contract

250
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
agreed to an arbitrator in advance and

251
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,720
then refused to abide

252
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,240
by that arbitrator's verdict he now

253
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
knows with a reasonable degree of

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
confidence

255
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
that you were the one who cheated that

256
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,360
it is therefore in his interest not to

257
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,279
do business with you but no reason not

258
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,120
to do business with me

259
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,880
you have now been punished with a loss

260
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
of reputation

261
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
which makes it in your interest to keep

262
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,600
your contracts

263
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,040
one problem solved however there are

264
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,240
still problems remaining what if you

265
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
want to do business with me

266
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
but you have no reputation that it would

267
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,000
be costly for you to lose

268
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,399
so i have no reason to trust you and

269
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,000
there are three different solutions to

270
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,240
that problem

271
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,800
one of them is if one of us has a

272
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,839
reputation

273
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,160
we set up the contract so that only that

274
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,760
one has to be trusted

275
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,720
if the seller has a reputation the buyer

276
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,399
pays in advance

277
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,920
the seller could collect the money and

278
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
not deliver but that would cost him his

279
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,959
reputation

280
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,000
if the buyer has a reputation the seller

281
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,880
delivers and then the buyer pays and in

282
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,519
fact

283
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,920
this is a familiar way we do things in

284
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,959
real space

285
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,519
i pay amazon in advance they don't have

286
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,200
the reputation of not delivering the

287
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,000
goods for

288
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,519
obvious reasons you can generalize this

289
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,959
approach to more complicated

290
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,079
transactions

291
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,640
in which each party performs different

292
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,959
parts of the contract over time

293
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,760
you are building a house for me i make

294
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,360
payments along the way

295
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
but you want to structure the contract

296
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
so that only one of us has an

297
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
opportunity to gain by breaching the

298
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
contract

299
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,480
and that's the one who has a reputation

300
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,120
at risk

301
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
and therefore won't so that's one

302
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,680
solution that you structure the contract

303
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,240
to put the risk of breach on the party

304
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,640
who can be trusted not to do it

305
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,240
what if neither of you has a reputation

306
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
then you rent a reputation from a third

307
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,279
party

308
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,079
possibly the arbitrator when you sign

309
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:00,880
the contract

310
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
each of you deposits ten thousand

311
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,399
dollars in digital cash with the

312
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,680
arbitrator

313
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,560
and if he defines that i've reached my

314
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,279
money

315
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
forfeits to you

316
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,040
of course the arbitrator could just

317
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
steal the money from both of us

318
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,320
pocket 20 000 and go home but

319
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
he would then lose his reputation

320
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,079
because he of course has a contract with

321
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,240
us which he's digitally signed

322
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,360
agreeing to do this and the reason we

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,519
chose that arbitrator was that he has a

324
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,640
reputation

325
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
that makes it not in his interest to

326
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,160
steal twenty thousand dollars

327
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,079
at the cost of a hundred thousand dollar

328
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,640
reputation

329
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,560
the real world equivalent of this is an

330
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,839
escrow agent which

331
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,079
ebay for example uses if you're buying

332
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,680
something where you have to inspect it

333
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
before you

334
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,360
you accept it it goes to the escrow

335
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,600
agent you inspect the product

336
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
you then pay the money and the escrow

337
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,600
agent gives the goods

338
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,120
to you third possibility is to buy a

339
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,760
reputation

340
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,680
i want to go in business online and have

341
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,880
no reputation

342
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,320
so i do something online that is visible

343
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,800
and expensive and that is linked to my

344
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,079
virtual identity

345
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,880
for example i give fifty thousand

346
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
dollars to a popular online charity

347
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,839
or i run an expensive online advertising

348
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,399
campaign

349
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,399
now if

350
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,560
if i contract with you and break the

351
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,920
contract

352
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,320
then the expensive reputation i have

353
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,680
bought vanishes

354
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,959
and so i won't do that

355
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,320
arguably this is one reason

356
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
why in real space companies conduct such

357
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,320
ad campaigns

358
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,720
part of the reason is that having spent

359
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
a lot of money on the ad campaign

360
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
people know that they are not planning

361
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
to just take your money and run

362
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,160
because that will then burn up the

363
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,079
reputation they have bought

364
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,440
with the ad campaign and a classical

365
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,360
example of this is that in the 19th

366
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,240
century

367
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,880
when banks in the u.s were issuing their

368
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,519
own money

369
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,880
the so-called wildcat banking period the

370
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,519
banks had expensive buildings suitable

371
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,959
only for banks with fancy marble facings

372
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,639
they weren't worth building if you were

373
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,639
planning to get people to deposit money

374
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,360
and then steal it and head out of town

375
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,800
so the fact that you had made the

376
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,160
investment in that building

377
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,839
was evidence you were going to stay

378
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,120
around

379
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,680
once i've bought a reputation future

380
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
honest transactions build it

381
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,079
the longer i've been in business online

382
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,720
the more valuable my reputation to me

383
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,240
hence the more people are willing to

384
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
trust me and this is a mechanism that

385
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,399
already exists in industries such as the

386
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,839
diamond business

387
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,440
where people who've been in the business

388
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,160
for a long time can be trusted

389
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,000
because the value of being trusted is

390
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,480
high to them and there are mechanisms

391
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,480
though not online mechanisms in that

392
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
business

393
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,839
for confirming who has or has not

394
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,839
cheated

395
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,440
you wouldn't want to give somebody with

396
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
a ten thousand dollar reputation

397
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,360
the opportunity for a hundred thousand

398
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
dollar default so a

399
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,639
high value reputation is itself valuable

400
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,240
because it means people will trust you

401
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
more

402
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,000
so the solution to contract enforcement

403
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,800
online

404
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,440
without government courts is you use

405
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
arbitrators and digital signatures

406
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
to make it easy for third parties to

407
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,880
know which party broke the contract

408
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,800
you structure your contract so that any

409
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,560
risk of breach is on a party with a

410
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,279
reputation to lose

411
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,199
if necessary you rent someone else's

412
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,560
reputation or

413
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,560
buy and build a reputation for yourself

414
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,519
for more details on that you can go to

415
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,639
my webpage

416
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,839
and in particular look at an old article

417
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,320
of mine

418
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,440
academic contracts in cyberspace which

419
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,160
you can see there

420
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,920
let's say a little bit more about the

421
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,800
downside

422
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,120
of strong privacy what are the reasons

423
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,880
this might be a bad thing i've been

424
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,519
generally presenting it as a good thing

425
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,839
well one effect which could be good or

426
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,279
bad is you can't tax what you cannot see

427
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,240
so this is going to restrict the ability

428
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
of governments to collect taxes on

429
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
things happening online

430
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,279
if i earn my money in cyberspace and

431
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,959
spend it in real space

432
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,160
the government can tax my expenditures

433
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,360
my purchases

434
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,600
if i earn my money in real space and

435
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,519
spend it in cyberspace the government

436
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,279
can tax my income

437
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,600
but if i earn money in cyberspace and

438
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,560
spend it

439
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,279
in cyberspace the government cannot see

440
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,279
the transactions and so i cannot collect

441
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,560
taxes if you think that the world would

442
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,399
be a better place if governments had

443
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,279
more access

444
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,680
to other people's money then that's a

445
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,480
bug

446
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,160
and if you have the opposite opinion

447
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
it's a feature

448
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,880
a further problem and a more

449
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
unambiguously

450
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,560
dangerous one is that some kinds of

451
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,920
crime become easier

452
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,040
in this world that

453
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,480
uh for example one of the main ways in

454
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,519
which we now catch

455
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,639
kidnappers is by catching them when they

456
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,240
collect the money

457
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,000
that's not going to work anymore because

458
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,759
they can collect the money

459
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,759
as a payment in anonymous digital cash

460
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,600
where there is no need for any police

461
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,880
department to know

462
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,639
where that payment is going to what

463
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,320
human being

464
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,560
so therefore kidnapping and extortion of

465
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,759
various sorts

466
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,320
become more workable than they used to

467
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,680
be

468
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,519
furthermore with a little bit of

469
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,199
ingenuity you could set up

470
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,399
a business plan for murder incorporated

471
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,920
in which a firm uses this technology

472
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,720
to establish two things one of them is

473
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
what its public key is

474
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,319
and the other is that it kills people

475
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,559
there are presumably a fair number of

476
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,160
people who have other people they'd like

477
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,520
removed

478
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,640
as best i can tell from news stories the

479
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
price of that service is less than the

480
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,959
price of a new car and most of us if we

481
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,599
really want to can afford a car

482
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,839
the reason that it isn't practical to

483
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
hire somebody to murder

484
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,880
your rival in love or professional

485
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
rival or whatever or just the person who

486
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,000
you hate

487
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,280
is that there's no at present no safe

488
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
way of contacting anybody selling that

489
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,160
service

490
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,400
and with this technology there are ways

491
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,840
of solving that problem

492
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,200
unfortunately so this is not an

493
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,360
unambiguously

494
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,799
good thing but it is a change that may

495
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,600
happen

496
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,640
and that creates a very different world

497
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,080
one of whose features is that

498
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,760
governments has less control

499
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,880
over people for the good or for them and

500
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,600
there are

501
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,720
defenses in the technology as well that

502
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,799
they can't extort money from you if they

503
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,559
don't know you have money

504
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,440
so if you are earning your money online

505
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,000
and spending it online

506
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,080
then there's no reason why any third

507
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,360
party should know

508
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,799
that you're rich and in fact

509
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,080
my understanding is that one of the

510
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,200
motives for some earlier developments of

511
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,360
payment online the earliest version of

512
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
paypal

513
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
is that they intended to set it up as a

514
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,679
system

515
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,960
using personal digital assistants pdas

516
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,080
the predecessors of cell phones

517
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,520
for people in third world countries who

518
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,039
thought it would be dangerous that

519
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,960
either their neighbors or their governor

520
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
government knew that they were earning a

521
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
good deal of money online

522
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
and that for various reasons didn't work

523
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,720
out and paypal ended up as being a less

524
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,440
exotic

525
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,160
plan but the original plan was indeed

526
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,559
associated with these approaches

527
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,000
uh similarly uh if i am criticizing the

528
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,760
government but i'm doing it as an

529
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,000
anonymous online person

530
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,679
there is no way that the government can

531
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,880
execute me or arrest me and in fact

532
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,799
the earliest discussion of this set of

533
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,320
issues is a

534
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,080
science fiction story by werner vinja

535
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,480
in which the it looks like a fantasy

536
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
because what you're seeing are the

537
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,039
online activities not the real space

538
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,280
but the essential point there is that

539
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,160
anonymity

540
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,559
is a protection that as long as nobody

541
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,760
knows who you are

542
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,039
they can't do things to you which

543
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,440
in the story it sort of is paralleling

544
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,960
the fantasy idea

545
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
that if they which if a sorcerer or

546
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,720
homage

547
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,760
keeps his true name secret then people

548
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
can't use magic against him and the

549
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,400
ninja story is called true names and

550
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
it's about the equivalent of that

551
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,120
in an online world where your true name

552
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,679
is your

553
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,880
is your real space identity

554
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,640
so all of this suggests that there's

555
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,240
going to be a tension between things

556
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,080
happening in real space where

557
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,240
governments can rule you and assassins

558
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
can kill you

559
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,760
and what is happening in cyberspace

560
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,440
where you use control

561
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,919
over information about you in order to

562
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,320
protect yourself

563
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,480
what is the world i'm describing look

564
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,440
like if we think about both the online

565
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,880
and the real space versions of it

566
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,600
in cyberspace that is stateless we will

567
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,159
develop

568
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,960
private legal systems enforced via

569
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
reputation

570
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,000
you don't want to have to write a 50

571
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,320
page contract for every deal

572
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,720
just as in the modern world you want to

573
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,679
have a

574
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,559
five or ten page contract and a legal

575
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,120
system

576
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,039
which in effect fills in all the blanks

577
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,240
from you for you

578
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,159
except the ones you want to change and

579
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,440
that's going to develop

580
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,159
online as indeed private legal systems

581
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,760
have in the past

582
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,400
lex mercantoria is the famous example

583
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,440
merchant law

584
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,679
that developed in the fair fair courts

585
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,480
of medieval

586
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,240
europe the state however still rules

587
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,919
real space

588
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,520
so it matters a lot how much of human

589
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,039
life is in cyberspace

590
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,159
and how much is in real space and

591
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,280
part of what helps me think about this

592
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,240
is to remember that i took a trip i took

593
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
a trip to india a few years

594
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,919
and my daughter who is a freelance

595
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,080
online editor came with me

596
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,679
she did the same work she would have

597
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,320
done at home when she was in new delhi

598
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,840
and she could stay in touch with the

599
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,240
same friends so that for her

600
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,720
in that situation the minor fact that we

601
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,240
were on the other side of the world

602
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,039
didn't really affect things very much if

603
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,559
enough people are living those

604
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,840
lives then governments

605
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,559
become the equivalent of landlords they

606
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,880
can control the physical land

607
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
they can charge you rent for living

608
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,799
under their jurisdiction

609
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,880
but if they charge you more rent than

610
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,320
you think you ought to pay

611
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,000
you find another government offering

612
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,760
better terms so you then have

613
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,039
governments in effect

614
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,240
competing for taxpayers to some extent

615
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,600
they do that already

616
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,840
but they do that a whole lot more if

617
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,679
taxpayers are very mobile

618
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,760
which they are in a world where very

619
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,039
large parts of life

620
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,159
are happening in cyberspace

621
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,120
the final question is not how it can

622
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,080
happen

623
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,840
but why it may not happen

624
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,559
first the world i describe requires a

625
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,000
widespread

626
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
crypto infrastructure you need a world

627
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,559
where essentially everybody

628
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,799
has a private key public key pair which

629
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,720
you can roll up today if you feel like

630
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,679
it

631
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,840
and where there are mechanisms for

632
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,880
distributing

633
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,520
public keys which i can discuss if

634
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,200
people are curious about it

635
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,240
but ways of distributing the public key

636
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,400
so that people can be reasonably sure

637
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,280
they actually

638
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,679
have uh the public key of a particular

639
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,440
real space person if they want to deal

640
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,880
in real space

641
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,960
and such that anybody who wants to reach

642
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,400
you in cyberspace

643
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,240
can find your your public key

644
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,600
once such a infrastructure exists it's

645
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,360
in people's interests to fit themselves

646
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,039
into it

647
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,400
but that's the chicken and the egg

648
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
problem i should say one further part of

649
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
the infrastructure that i didn't mention

650
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,000
but since it looks as though i'm

651
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,320
running a couple of minutes under my

652
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,120
time limit

653
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,760
i thought i would is how you keep the

654
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,360
government or anybody else from knowing

655
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,120
who you're talking to

656
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,720
and that requires what are called

657
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,480
anonymous remailers

658
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,520
which means sites where i send my email

659
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,039
to the site

660
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,200
it sends it on it forwards it to the

661
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,600
person i want it forwarded to

662
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
but there's a layer of encryption in

663
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,000
between the anonymous remailer has its

664
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,640
own public key and private key

665
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,520
i take my message i encrypt it with the

666
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,360
recipient's public key

667
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,279
i encrypt all of that with the

668
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,880
remailer's public key

669
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,120
i send it to the remailer the remailer

670
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,279
strips off his level of encryption

671
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,159
and sends it on to my my intended

672
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,520
recipient

673
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,760
and if i don't trust the remailer my

674
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
intended recipient is really another

675
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,559
uh remailer and you could imagine in the

676
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,000
extreme case where you're really

677
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,080
afraid someone is spying on you that you

678
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,520
bounce it through ten layers of

679
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,799
remailers

680
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,559
each one's stripping off one layer of

681
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,559
encryption and unless all ten of them

682
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,240
are working for the same bad guy

683
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,320
you're safe so the basic point is that

684
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,960
like most worlds it requires a bunch of

685
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,000
people to do things

686
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
all of which fit together and that may

687
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,799
or may not happen

688
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,679
furthermore the version of anonymous

689
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,600
cache i was thinking about when i wrote

690
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
the articles i've pointed you at

691
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,080
which was the version invented by david

692
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,799
chow

693
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,120
has one very serious weakness and that

694
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,640
is it requires a bank

695
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,360
it requires a trusted issuer the issuer

696
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,880
holds your money

697
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,360
it gives to you it to you in a form so

698
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,960
that you can make transfers to other

699
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,840
people

700
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,120
where you don't have to know who the

701
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
other person is only how to get a

702
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,000
message to him

703
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
he doesn't have to know who how who you

704
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,080
are only how to send you whatever you're

705
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,039
bought

706
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,720
and the bank never knows who either of

707
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,480
you is and chow

708
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,559
figured out a way a clever way using

709
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,240
encryption to do that

710
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,120
but you still have to trust the bank

711
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,480
trusted banks

712
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
are in the kind of respectable country

713
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,320
where you're reasonably sure they

714
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,679
are really doing what they say they're

715
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,080
doing that requires

716
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,840
a developed country pretty much

717
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,279
someplace like the us

718
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,640
or germany or the netherlands

719
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,559
and the governments of those countries

720
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,279
don't want anonymous currency

721
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,799
because watching money flow is one way

722
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,840
in which governments

723
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,240
enforce tax laws and drug laws and

724
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,600
various other things

725
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,240
to put it differently once there is a

726
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,080
form of anonymous e cash

727
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,840
now money laundering law has become

728
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,840
unenforceable and the government has

729
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,559
just lost

730
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,440
a sizable source of both revenue and

731
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,480
control

732
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,720
so that was the weakness of chow mean

733
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,919
digital cash

734
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,919
and the reason that it never came into

735
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,600
existence even though the math was

736
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,039
worked out i would guess maybe

737
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,640
by now 40 years ago something like that

738
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,240
there may be a solution and the solution

739
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,000
is maybe cryptocurrency the beauty of

740
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,559
bitcoin is that no issue issuer is

741
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,360
required

742
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,440
there is no bank just just mathematics

743
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,559
uh just code on the other hand the

744
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,320
weakness of bitcoin

745
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,919
is that it is the least anonymous

746
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,000
currency that has ever been issued

747
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,039
because every transaction in bitcoin is

748
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,039
public information to everybody using

749
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,400
bitcoin

750
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,320
now that's a slight overstatement

751
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,480
because the public information is not

752
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,200
between people but between accounts so

753
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,840
you can maintain some level of privacy

754
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,279
by keeping as secret as you can the link

755
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,000
between your real space identity and the

756
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,039
bitcoin

757
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,360
uh account that you are using to hold

758
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,240
your money

759
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,559
but somebody who watches carefully can

760
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,799
probably break that anonymity

761
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,840
he can make a payment to you

762
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,159
knowing your real space identity observe

763
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,919
what account that goes to

764
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,600
so you have to do various fancy things

765
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,120
to prevent that

766
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
on the other hand there are at least two

767
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,240
projects that i know of and

768
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,679
so there may be other people here who

769
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,320
know of others to try to develop

770
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,559
cryptocurrencies that are more nearly

771
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,760
anonymous

772
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,960
i say more nearly anonymous because i

773
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,240
had a session at a

774
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,880
conference maybe a couple of years ago

775
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,080
on this subject

776
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,840
and there were people there from both of

777
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
the projects

778
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,000
and both of them agreed that they

779
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,679
couldn't make their cryptocurrency

780
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,880
perfectly anonymous

781
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,760
that is to say a bad guy willing to

782
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,360
spend enough resources

783
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,600
watching you long enough to try to

784
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
deduce from transactions who you are

785
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,000
could eventually do it however they can

786
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
make it very hard

787
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,279
and if it's hard enough that's about

788
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,799
what you can hope for

789
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,360
that in general when i talk about what

790
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,919
you can or can't do with encryption

791
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,039
there's always the implicit assumption

792
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,039
of some limit to resources

793
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,080
so that i said earlier that the

794
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,399
key that encrypts things can't decrypt

795
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,679
it if you had infinite time

796
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,600
you have an encrypted message you have

797
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,799
the public key

798
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,960
you just write out all possible messages

799
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,559
that let long

800
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,240
encrypt all of them with the public key

801
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
and look to see which one matches

802
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
of course if you want to do that you

803
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
probably should provide a good supply of

804
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,960
candles

805
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,279
because the sun will have burned out by

806
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,360
the time you finish

807
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,559
making every possible copy of a 10

808
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,120
000 character message i'll let you work

809
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,960
out the arithmetic for yourself

810
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,200
encrypting it and checking so it's

811
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,080
really all of this is really saying

812
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,679
this works as long as the opponent has

813
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,159
less than some amount of resources

814
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,919
governments have a lot of resources

815
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,360
but they also have a lot of people they

816
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,799
want to watch which means that those

817
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,960
resources get divided up

818
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,559
so all of these are reasons

819
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,039
why it might not happen i don't want a

820
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,799
claim to be a prophet i have a book

821
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,600
future imperfect which discusses this

822
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,440
technology and many others

823
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,760
and one of the lessons of that book is

824
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,600
the future is radically uncertain

825
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,840
we don't really know what i'm trying to

826
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,600
do is to sketch out

827
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,720
one possible future that you

828
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:41,840
and even i may live in thank you

829
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,159
i think i'm back now can i unshare my

830
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:02,960
screen

831
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,840
let's try that yes i've unshared my

832
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,600
screen

833
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,640
what happens now do people ask me

834
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:23,840
questions and i get to talk to them

835
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
well it seems that we are full of

836
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
technical difficulties right here

837
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,919
uh first you can join now weekends but

838
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,120
david did you hear me now again

839
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
fantastic this was a this was a very

840
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,120
very i can hear you as usual uh

841
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,960
your rational mind this is beautiful to

842
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,440
follow um it's very well done so thank

843
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,840
you

844
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,039
we do have a couple very nice

845
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,720
interesting questions in the chat here

846
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,760
um the first

847
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,200
by by colin kirby reputation based

848
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,440
transactional systems work with strong

849
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,480
privacy

850
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,559
implemented by default okay the by

851
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,159
default part important

852
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,080
if i do not wish to reveal that i have

853
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,279
ever engaged

854
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,519
engaged in a contract with someone and

855
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,279
desired to keep all of my business

856
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,000
private

857
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,600
how would i build a reputation in the

858
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,399
very first place

859
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,519
but the answer is that in this system

860
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,720
the person who you want to contract with

861
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
will only contract with you if you are

862
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,000
willing to

863
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,240
digitally sign a contract specifying an

864
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,279
arbitrator

865
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,840
that you can't you know can't sign a

866
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,200
contract all by yourself

867
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,360
or at least there's no point to doing it

868
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,039
so the condition

869
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,120
and obviously i'm describing i'm

870
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,799
sketching sort of a simple version of

871
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,159
how the system works

872
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,000
and i could imagine that in the real

873
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,399
world you would both have

874
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,320
less rigorous versions which we already

875
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,159
have that ebay and

876
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,960
amazon both use reputational systems of

877
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,480
a less

878
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,640
elegant less less mathematical version

879
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,480
that i'm describing but they work pretty

880
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,600
well

881
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,679
but once this is developed there will

882
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,440
doubtless be fancier versions

883
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,200
but in what i'm in in the simple world

884
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,720
that i'm describing

885
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,279
people who don't trust you already are

886
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,880
only willing to sign

887
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,440
to do business with you if you agree to

888
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,360
digitally sign a contract specifying an

889
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,159
arbitrator

890
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,120
once you've done that uh however strong

891
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,320
your privacy

892
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,000
uh if you want people to do business

893
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,279
with you you've got to have some way for

894
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,480
them to find you

895
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,559
so you've got to have an online identity

896
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,000
even if you keep your real space

897
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,279
identity secret

898
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,519
and once you've got an online identity

899
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,960
uh people can

900
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,279
link to that online identity to point

901
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,720
other people who want to do business

902
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,200
with you

903
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,720
at the conference i think it's very

904
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,519
difficult to get in a truly anonymous

905
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,320
system

906
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,880
a reputation or to get this reputation

907
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,039
without relying on a trusted third party

908
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,399
right but of course trusted third

909
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,880
parties are security holes which is

910
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
i think a very very fundamental problem

911
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,080
that ought to be solved

912
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,840
uh and to speak of one potential

913
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,679
solution specifically

914
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,679
in the bitcoin ecosystem and that is

915
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,679
when one side of the trade

916
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,720
um is is actually um

917
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,880
like a bitcoin asset where we have

918
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
strong private property contracts

919
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,960
enforced in the script itself right it

920
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,399
never leaves cyberspace

921
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,960
um it is it is defined and enforced by

922
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,440
the notes

923
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,760
but the problem the problem with that as

924
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,960
i understand it

925
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,320
is that you then need some way in which

926
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,960
the software can observe what happens

927
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,880
this is the oracle problem which i'm

928
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,320
sure you're familiar with and there are

929
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,840
some ingenious

930
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,679
solutions which may or may not work to

931
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,640
those but on the whole

932
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,039
i think probably you are better off

933
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,240
using human beings as things now exist

934
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,480
than trying to write smart i know smart

935
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,799
contracts are a very old idea i

936
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,320
remember seeing discussions of those

937
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,880
probably 30 years ago

938
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,039
and it maybe it may prove workable in

939
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,159
some cases

940
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,200
but you have to have some way that

941
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,640
the uh software is sort of sophisticated

942
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,519
enough

943
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,360
to actually observe what the terms of

944
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,760
the contract are what they

945
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
and if you if you if you try to think

946
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
about real world contracts it's hard to

947
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,560
think of ones

948
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,040
which are so unambiguous you know did i

949
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,719
deliver what i said i would deliver well

950
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,399
i delivered a program that would do x

951
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,239
how do we decide whether it does x

952
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,599
and that's going to be hard to hard to

953
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,719
build in uh so i i still think that

954
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,399
trusted third parties given that you've

955
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,079
got a whole world full of third parties

956
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,199
to choose among

957
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,560
there are going to be some you can trust

958
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,280
i think but no system is perfect i don't

959
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,639
want to overstate this

960
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,320
i only but then of course our present

961
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,079
system isn't perfect either that

962
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,440
aside from all the problems with the

963
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,839
government's doing bad things

964
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,960
a court makes mistakes necessarily

965
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,440
because the court is human too

966
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,679
there are things which even if the court

967
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,599
doesn't make mistakes it can't observe

968
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,000
in order

969
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,159
to know what's happened so it seems to

970
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,520
me that on the whole

971
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,918
and this has the virtue that whereas the

972
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,679
courts is not

973
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,240
is mostly not a competitive system i

974
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,440
don't have a choice

975
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,000
of which court's law i have some choice

976
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
of which court's law to do things under

977
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,160
if i

978
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,920
form a corporation i can form it in

979
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,280
delaware if i think they have better

980
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,560
corporation law

981
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,640
but to a large extent in our present

982
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,040
system i'm stuck with a monopoly court

983
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,839
system

984
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,520
it's not clear that monopoly court

985
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
system has an incentive to to do a good

986
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,400
job

987
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,000
uh and on the other hand in this system

988
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,599
my arbitrators are in the business of

989
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,119
being arbitrators they want the

990
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,000
reputation

991
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,920
not only being honest but of being

992
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,280
competent

993
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,720
and not only being competent but of

994
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,400
having legal rules that people want to

995
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,040
have their

996
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,359
their contract judged under so this is

997
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,680
really creating a competitive market for

998
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,040
legal services and

999
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,680
i in my first book which was published

1000
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,079
about 71 or so so that's

1001
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,760
got almost 50 years old now i sketched

1002
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,920
a real space version of that where you

1003
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,359
had institutions that gave you

1004
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,520
private courts in effect competing for

1005
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,560
business

1006
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,200
in a market context where they wanted to

1007
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,880
create the kind of law people wanted to

1008
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,680
live under

1009
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,760
and this it seems to me that's may

1010
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,119
happen at some point in the future but

1011
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,040
not in my lifetime unless they

1012
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,440
solve the aging problem fairly quickly

1013
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,240
uh

1014
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,119
but uh but i think that could pretty

1015
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,880
easily happen online

1016
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,960
and i guess yes i really do believe so

1017
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,720
and for example

1018
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,760
isq is a decentralized marketplace

1019
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,400
um where individuals can open up offers

1020
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,480
uh to buy or sell bitcoin for whatever

1021
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,680
good or service most of them are

1022
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,720
cryptocurrencies

1023
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,800
uh but different fiat payments as well

1024
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,920
um and

1025
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,839
this uses also an arbitration model in a

1026
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,599
two of three multi-signature

1027
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,000
um and this is a very successful project

1028
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,720
i would say

1029
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,079
uh because for a very long time

1030
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,000
this was there was no occurrence of

1031
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,280
theft at all

1032
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,760
on the platform for multiple years um

1033
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,200
then there was one bug

1034
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,720
unfortunately being exploited by a

1035
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,320
malicious actor

1036
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,800
um the bug was fixed so unfortunately

1037
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,320
the stellar record is no longer there

1038
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,240
but it's a very successful project

1039
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,359
um i i would like to to shift to one

1040
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,280
more uh interesting topic and that

1041
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,640
is that you brought up these digital

1042
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,119
ecash banks and one of the main

1043
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,720
issues is that is one trusted third

1044
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,480
party right who could increase the the

1045
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,839
token supply at will

1046
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,400
um now last year at the hackers congress

1047
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,320
frank brown and smuggler revealed a new

1048
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,160
technology called scrit

1049
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,280
s-c-r-i-t and this enables to have a

1050
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,599
fully anonymous digital cash system that

1051
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,880
relies not on one

1052
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,760
but on a federation of m of n trusted

1053
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,800
third parties

1054
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,599
to to secure the spent book what are

1055
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,520
your thoughts on distributing this trust

1056
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,839
from one person to a federation yeah

1057
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
i i haven't looked at that i did i do

1058
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,440
have a system that i thought up and

1059
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,359
described in my blog probably a couple

1060
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,480
of years ago

1061
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,880
and that was for solving the specific

1062
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,480
problem of trying to have an e

1063
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,760
cash which had a fixed value in terms of

1064
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,079
uh of existing money so it would be

1065
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,040
convenient

1066
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,200
for some purposes to have an e cash

1067
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,720
which was always one for one with

1068
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,599
dollars say or

1069
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,000
between 99 cents and a dollar in one

1070
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,040
cent say

1071
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,280
and then i sketched out how you would do

1072
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,079
that where you have a group of issuers

1073
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,280
uh say 10 people organizations whatever

1074
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,760
they are

1075
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,119
each identified by its public key and

1076
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,480
what it being an issuer means is that if

1077
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:20,960
the

1078
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,440
value of the currency goes above one

1079
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,720
dollar

1080
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,400
someone is allowed to issue one more

1081
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,880
unit and it goes around the ring

1082
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,280
the next person in line gets to issue

1083
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,240
one unit

1084
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,480
until the price gets down to a dollar if

1085
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,920
it gets below a dollar

1086
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,760
the next person in line is obligated to

1087
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,040
burn one unit

1088
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,240
to pull in one unit and destroy it that

1089
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,359
costs him something

1090
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,280
but the reason he does that is that he

1091
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,200
fails he's out of the ring

1092
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,040
he's no longer has the right to create

1093
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,000
units so as long as your expectation

1094
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,400
is that the value is going to push up on

1095
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,119
average not

1096
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,160
down it pays the issuers

1097
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,119
to do this i can sell the right to be an

1098
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,480
issuer to somebody else

1099
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,640
because all i have to do is to give him

1100
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,079
my private key

1101
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,839
my old private key i'll roll up a new

1102
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,280
one for other purposes at that point

1103
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,599
so so that was a scheme i thought up

1104
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,520
because at the moment

1105
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,320
bitcoin is not very convenient for sort

1106
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,880
of casual currency uses because its

1107
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,599
value fluctuates the fact its value

1108
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,760
fluctuates doesn't matter very much in

1109
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,520
terms of gaining or losing money if you

1110
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,800
only have a hundred dollars worth of

1111
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,040
bitcoin it's a small part of your assets

1112
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,560
but it's a nuisance if you're trying to

1113
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,320
calculate prices uh

1114
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,760
and therefore it would be useful to have

1115
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,800
a cryptocurrency set up to be a

1116
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
one to one for a dollar or a euro or

1117
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,280
whatever the currencies are people use

1118
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,640
so that's what i thought of that scheme

1119
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,000
and that's vaguely similar to what

1120
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,280
you're describing in that they're a

1121
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,720
group of issuers

1122
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,760
uh and you only in a sense you only have

1123
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,440
to trust at least one of them

1124
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,480
in the sense that all they can do is

1125
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,560
issue if the price is above and what the

1126
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,320
price you then have to have a

1127
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,760
an oracle which will tell you what the

1128
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,359
price of your coin is

1129
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,200
so you would have to have the software

1130
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,920
have some trust and observation

1131
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
of exchange rates and you could probably

1132
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,760
figure out some fairly straightforward

1133
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,800
way of doing that

1134
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,319
but yeah no this whole world is an

1135
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,480
interesting world and i have not really

1136
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,079
tried to keep track of all the things

1137
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,760
people are doing in it that i'm

1138
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,640
ultimately a theorist not an empiricist

1139
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,560
that the real world is very complicated

1140
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,240
and i like simple things

1141
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,800
uh so i try to think figure out the

1142
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,319
logic of it and then look at bits and

1143
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,280
pieces

1144
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,200
but in terms of what's happening in the

1145
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,119
ordinary parts of real space as you

1146
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,400
probably know

1147
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,800
ebay indeed has set up reputational

1148
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
mechanisms not fancy ones like i

1149
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,319
described but ones where

1150
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,319
any time you buy from ebay you get to

1151
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,680
report on the seller

1152
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,280
and then other people who want to buy

1153
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,599
from that seller see that report

1154
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,960
amazon of course has reviews and

1155
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,160
one of the interesting things i

1156
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,599
discovered the obvious problem with

1157
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,200
amazon reviews

1158
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,160
is that you can fake them that you can

1159
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,359
buy

1160
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,359
a copy of your own product and then give

1161
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,480
it a good review

1162
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
but there is also software for spotting

1163
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
fake reviews as i discovered a while ago

1164
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,760
there's a website

1165
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,920
and they at least have algorithms which

1166
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,839
try to recognize the characteristics

1167
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,760
and i usually do it by hand as you read

1168
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,560
a review and you say how likely is it

1169
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,160
that this review was not really written

1170
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,319
by a human being telling the truth and

1171
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,240
that's in general one of the nice things

1172
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
about the web in my opinion

1173
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,920
is that because it's an obviously

1174
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,760
unfiltered medium

1175
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,480
it encourages people to figure out how

1176
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,240
to tell who to believe

1177
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,520
on internal evidence that if you're not

1178
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,119
brain dead you know that the fact that

1179
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,400
something is on the web doesn't mean

1180
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,520
it's true

1181
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,280
and then you try to develop other

1182
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,760
mechanisms for figuring out what is true

1183
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,079
and that is a very important skill in

1184
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,160
lots of places other than the web

1185
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,880
that that you want to know when does it

1186
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,560
sound as though this person is trying to

1187
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,480
put one over on you

1188
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,079
when does it sound as though he's making

1189
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,160
an honest argument doing the best he can

1190
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,880
to give the

1191
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,480
arguments against the position as well

1192
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,920
as for his position so

1193
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,680
the extreme in the other direction was

1194
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,760
the debate last

1195
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,119
night last night or the night before

1196
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,520
last between two president presidential

1197
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,480
candidates

1198
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,079
where it was pretty obvious after the

1199
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,839
first three minutes that neither of them

1200
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,520
could be trusted that they're

1201
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,000
both the demagogues saying whatever they

1202
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,119
think will work

1203
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,800
and you can choose your taste and

1204
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,880
demagogues but

1205
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,960
but online there are people who can be

1206
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,680
trusted and people that's very good

1207
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,000
maybe to finish it up with one question

1208
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,520
that i think is very present

1209
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,319
as well and that is how to make a secure

1210
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,800
transition from meat space to cyberspace

1211
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,560
right so how do we choose secured

1212
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,000
dwelling places

1213
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,319
and how do we protect physical locations

1214
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,800
uh specifically ensuring travel in

1215
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,040
between these physical locations

1216
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,520
um in a sign in a time where we have a

1217
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,280
lot of censorship of free movement

1218
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,839
currently

1219
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,560
i'm not sure i understand how you can do

1220
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
how that's possible that is to say

1221
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,800
the the the state still controls real

1222
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,000
space

1223
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
so there is no way that you if a

1224
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,200
government says

1225
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,880
we will not allow you into our country

1226
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,480
unless you show your passport and let us

1227
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,920
photograph your face there's no way you

1228
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,440
can stop them from doing that as far as

1229
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,319
i can tell

1230
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,400
you can get into their country online

1231
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,760
that is to say you can

1232
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,359
deal with people in their country from

1233
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,960
somewhere else

1234
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,359
but your physical body is something that

1235
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,560
they can observe

1236
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,920
and in fact one of the things i

1237
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,319
discussed in in my book future imperfect

1238
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,640
is the tension between surveillance and

1239
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,440
encryption

1240
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,319
the fact that surveillance technology

1241
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,520
plus face recognition plus databases

1242
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,920
gives the possibility of a world where

1243
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,520
everything that happens in a real space

1244
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,680
is recorded and findable

1245
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,680
so you could at the same time have a

1246
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,680
world which was strong privacy in real

1247
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,640
space

1248
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,200
and david bryn's transparent society

1249
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,520
sorry strong privacy in cyberspace david

1250
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,119
brin's transparent society and real

1251
00:43:59,119 --> 00:43:59,760
space

1252
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,520
and you can then think of ways in which

1253
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,800
each of them could try to affect the

1254
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,440
other

1255
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
that the real space people can watch you

1256
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,119
typing on your keyboard to try to break

1257
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,720
your encryption

1258
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,240
the cyberspace people could do their

1259
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,800
conversations

1260
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,400
even in real space the bluetooth

1261
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,560
communication with encrypted

1262
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,200
uh voices and so forth so it's

1263
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,400
interesting to try to think about

1264
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
probably more fun for a science fiction

1265
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:24,960
writer

1266
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,319
uh for avenger or bryn than uh for me

1267
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,760
i've written some fantasy but nothing

1268
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,839
that's really science fiction uh

1269
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,400
but also interesting to speculate so if

1270
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,200
you people

1271
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,599
i should say most of my book many of my

1272
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,680
books probably most of my books

1273
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,760
are available online to be read for free

1274
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,440
from my web page although it's

1275
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,839
there's usually a cleaner better easier

1276
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,680
to read version that you can pay for

1277
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,040
they're not very expensive as as kindles

1278
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,720
or as as printed books

1279
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,440
uh my latest project really with any of

1280
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,160
this

1281
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,800
is that my second novel has just been

1282
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,560
recorded and it's going to be available

1283
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,640
as an audiobook very shortly it's called

1284
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,599
salamander

1285
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,200
and i think the guy who recorded it did

1286
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,000
a really good job

1287
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,079
you know let's do one more quick final

1288
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,119
question already talking about

1289
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,000
speculation

1290
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
of course you've speculated quite a lot

1291
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,520
in your writings early

1292
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,200
and it turns out that you're pretty spot

1293
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,560
on in many cases

1294
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,680
probably because of strong first

1295
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,079
principles and a beautiful rational mind

1296
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,160
so how do you elaborate further let's

1297
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,680
talk about the next

1298
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,440
one two generations where do you think

1299
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,520
technology uh helping or

1300
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,839
liberating individuals

1301
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,079
almost certainly both just as in the

1302
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:38,960
past

1303
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,839
that on the one hand i think the

1304
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,440
developments i was talking about in this

1305
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,839
talk are going to liberate

1306
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,760
individuals in some ways

1307
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,480
unrelated technologies already liberated

1308
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
individuals the very fact

1309
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,280
that i have better access to information

1310
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,520
today sitting at my desk

1311
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,839
than i would have sitting in the library

1312
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,920
of congress 50 years ago

1313
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,119
that i write books

1314
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,200
i'm currently in the process of

1315
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,520
converting 15 years of blog posts

1316
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,839
into probably two or three books i would

1317
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:12,640
guess

1318
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,319
in doing that there are facts i've got

1319
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,680
to look up

1320
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,319
uh i see a reference to something it

1321
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,280
used to be that

1322
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,720
checking that reference and figuring out

1323
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,560
what it was would be

1324
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,079
required me to go to a library and

1325
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,280
probably spend a couple of hours

1326
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,119
searching stuff now i can do it in 10

1327
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,079
minutes

1328
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,880
on wikipedia and google and all of those

1329
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,359
things

1330
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,839
so that such stuff has liberated people

1331
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,839
in a non-political sense very very very

1332
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:36,880
largely uh

1333
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,440
you know they're i used to say that i i

1334
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,800
wrote my second book

1335
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,640
uh using a word processor a very early

1336
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,240
word processor on a

1337
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,720
super clone of the trs-80 for those old

1338
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,560
enough to remember that machine

1339
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,160
lnw80 nice machine and after i finished

1340
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,200
writing that book

1341
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
i concluded that prior to the invention

1342
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,400
of the word processor

1343
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,839
no books were written it's just too much

1344
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,520
work

1345
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,200
and there are a bunch of things which

1346
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,599
are easy now and used to be hard so

1347
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,599
those technologies are liberating us for

1348
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:06,720
reasons having little to do with

1349
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,720
politics at the same time

1350
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,240
some of the things that governments want

1351
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,400
to do also are easy that used to be hard

1352
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,000
so that i have a discussion also in that

1353
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,800
book

1354
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,640
that if you think about wiretaps

1355
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,359
it used to be that the real limitation

1356
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,559
to wiretaps

1357
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,440
was not the courts it was the money it

1358
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,440
was the fact that in order to operate a

1359
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,680
wiretap you have to have a human being

1360
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,680
listening to the phone for hundreds of

1361
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,240
hours you have to do that for many many

1362
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:36,800
people

1363
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,160
and once in a while you'll find what

1364
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,839
you're looking for that problem has been

1365
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:40,640
solved

1366
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,920
we've got uh speech-to-text software

1367
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,839
a friend of mine helped develop it

1368
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,839
worked for dragon dictate a long time

1369
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,280
ago

1370
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,319
and with speech to text software

1371
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,480
you can have a computer listen to the

1372
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,359
phone

1373
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,839
the computer can then analyze it looking

1374
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,040
for keywords

1375
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,720
and it only turns it over to human being

1376
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,720
when it finds them computers work fast

1377
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,520
and cheap

1378
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,839
i did some calculations years ago i'm

1379
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,280
sure would be cheaper now

1380
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,119
and i concluded that you could be

1381
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,359
tapping every phone in the u.s

1382
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,880
for a capital investment of a few

1383
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,640
billion dollars worth of computer

1384
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,440
hardware

1385
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,839
and probably cheaper now i'm not sure

1386
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,280
but and that was at

1387
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,280
a time when it looked as though the fbi

1388
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,319
wanted

1389
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,000
they didn't put it that way but they

1390
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,160
wanted technology that would let them

1391
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,640
tap

1392
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,520
huge numbers of phones at once and this

1393
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,079
was a

1394
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,119
digital wiretap bill again decades ago

1395
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:33,520
but

1396
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,480
these issues aren't going to go away so

1397
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,480
so on the one hand the technology

1398
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,240
empowers people but some of those people

1399
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,839
are good people and some of them are bad

1400
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:42,400
people

1401
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,240
and some are in between some of them are

1402
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,520
people who think they're doing good

1403
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,599
things but i may disagree

1404
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,040
i mean i assume that the fbi most fbi

1405
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,720
agents are not people who think they're

1406
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,000
doing evil

1407
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,079
nonetheless i would let rather live in a

1408
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,079
world where the government can't easily

1409
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,280
know what other people

1410
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,440
are doing because it quite often wants

1411
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,200
to know for bad reasons

1412
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,200
so so i don't think there's a simple

1413
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,800
answer to your question it's the general

1414
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,240
question is the world getting better or

1415
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,800
worse and the answer is always yes

1416
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,200
uh that china has gotten enormously

1417
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,319
better

1418
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,839
not as much better as it should have

1419
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,359
it's still a dictatorship

1420
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,359
but it's now a more or less capitalist

1421
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,078
dictatorship

1422
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,559
like what spain or portugal was say

1423
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,319
under their dictators

1424
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,079
and that's a great improvement over a

1425
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,599
communist dictatorship

1426
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,920
because under the communist dictatorship

1427
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,440
people were starving to death in very

1428
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,000
large numbers and people were very poor

1429
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,440
so that's the respect in which the world

1430
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,599
got a lot better in our lifetime it's

1431
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,720
i think the changes from mao's death

1432
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,200
uh for the next 20 years or so may be

1433
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,280
the largest increase in human welfare

1434
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,720
that's ever happened in that short

1435
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,559
period of time

1436
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,640
but at the same time it's always heating

1437
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,880
itself up so ever expanding and

1438
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,000
developing david this was a phenomenal

1439
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,520
talk thank you very much for this after

1440
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,800
conversation as well

1441
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,800
uh again a beautiful display of some

1442
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,880
nice reasoning and logic uh i

1443
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,559
treasure that very much so thank you

1444
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,760
again for coming on to the hackers

1445
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,480
congress

1446
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,160
uh and hopefully see you next year again

1447
