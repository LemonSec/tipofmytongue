00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,520
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,080
um

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,559
so i'm actually quite surprised by like

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,240
uh how many people showed up

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,880
i expected there to be like two or three

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,679
uh and

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,360
for the talk to be more of like a

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,960
discussion format so i'll be happy if

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,359
you

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,359
guys join my name is joseph

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,119
i maintain the local hackerspace in the

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,480
basement in case you haven't been there

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,880
yet

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,320
go to bordell when you see the

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,480
the red known sign saying bordeaux just

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,719
you know don't be shy and sure

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,920
um but yeah today uh i'm going to talk

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,960
about identity

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,200
uh in general about identity in the

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,239
context of

21
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,399
digital totality um and um

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,120
how i think the identity space and the

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,480
identification space

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,879
um is is going to evolve especially in

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,640
the context of web3

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,320
um so beyond um paraneopolis uh i'm

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,399
involved with in the ethereum community

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,120
i've been

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,600
um working on like few projects uh one

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,239
of them was

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,920
touching identity about like two or

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
three years ago um

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,799
so um in the end like we can also

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,880
discuss like implementation details if

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,920
anyone is interested so first of all i'm

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,759
going to talk about like what is what is

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,560
an identity

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640
uh how did we get to where we are now um

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
through like the evolution of

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,759
authentication um

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,759
then i want to talk about the 3 paradigm

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,360
and like how does that fit in

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,479
uh and in the end i want to mention like

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,240
few in my opinion interesting groups

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,079
that are

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,759
kind of researching the identity topic

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,200
for

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,399
20 years now and

49
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,560
then about some like practical use cases

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,159
that can be already tried out

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,159
so uh what is identity um

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,119
the cambridge dictionary uh and like

53
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,320
bunch of other random

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,520
google searches uh we'll show you uh

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,399
show you this

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,200
um identity is who a person is or the

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,799
qualities of a person

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,119
or group that make them different from

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,479
others so

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,399
this means it's just those set of things

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,080
that it's like different from anyone

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,200
else and that's how you

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,040
identify and now what do you identify

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,800
uh we can talk about like personal

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
identity uh we can talk about an

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
identity of an organization

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,520
um or like a nationwide identity or

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,040
identity with a tribe with ethnicity um

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,280
and about like identities of whole bunch

70
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,800
of other things i'm sure at one point

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
we'll talk about

72
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,959
different identities and the

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,879
distinguishing factors of like

74
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,319
different um popular ai um

75
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,760
setups um so that that would be kind of

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
the

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,840
uh you know like human sciences uh type

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
of definition

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,319
um the other one the more exact one uh

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,640
you can say that identity is basically

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,760
uh

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,879
a mathematical operator uh the equal

83
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,280
but we are not going to talk about that

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,000
um

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,319
so during this talk i want to focus

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,239
mostly on personal identity but i think

87
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,280
uh it's still worthwhile to kind of like

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,239
reason about

89
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,840
um the other connections because

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,239
especially like throughout the evolution

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,480
um

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,879
those things are interconnected so what

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,799
do you what do you think was

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,280
the first

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,280
way to identify one another

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,400
um within within like a you know like a

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,360
group of people

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
humans um that that's known today what

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,319
do you think is the oldest thing that

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,400
people use to authentic

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
authenticate themselves

102
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,080
what a name as like a verbal operator

103
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,439
um so sure uh that's

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,840
that's like a label of a person and then

105
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
you would just like distribute knowledge

106
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,439
among the group any other thoughts

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,040
all right uh yeah now we are getting

108
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,640
into like

109
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,120
the identity of of like a different

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
tribe system

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,000
uh but the the kind of first associated

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,639
item

113
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,800
um talking about like um a physical item

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,160
uh that's known is uh jewelry or like

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
visual symbols

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,930
um so um

117
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,840
[Music]

118
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,400
roughly 100 000 years before christ

119
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,280
people used to

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
like wear different jewelries to

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
associate themselves with the tribe

122
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,000
basically these these insignias

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,280
are used today uh even even like

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,240
in this age but uh prevalently like

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
those were just used throughout the

126
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,639
history you could you could say

127
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,320
you know like the the local shaman or

128
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,919
the local king is the guy with the crown

129
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,199
right that was that was his

130
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,960
identification whoever had the crown was

131
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
the king

132
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,120
um that's how you tell he's a king um

133
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,520
but

134
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,160
even in like more you know like um

135
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,960
primitive

136
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,360
um social groups uh they were just like

137
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,639
different types of bones like different

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,560
types of rings that people are wearing

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,160
to identify themselves with

140
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,680
like their family or their tribe

141
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,039
so roughly um

142
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,320
2000 years before christ uh at least

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,120
depend you know like um given the given

144
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,560
the archaeological research

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,520
as far as we can tell tattoos were this

146
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,000
old

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
um and like one of the one of the ways

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
like people

149
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,400
started like identifying themselves

150
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
personally um

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,680
with something you cannot remove from

152
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,280
them going beyond like the physical

153
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
objects or tattoos

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,759
uh so this is a study of a man found

155
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,199
somewhere in china um um

156
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,919
apparently originating like thousands of

157
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,039
years ago

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,080
uh this is a member of jacuzza who was

159
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
uh arrested like two years ago somewhere

160
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,080
in malaysia i believe

161
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
um but this was this was kind of you

162
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,520
know this was like getting chipped

163
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,400
right like you just use your body to put

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,759
like all of the symbols

165
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,840
so people can tell like this is the guy

166
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,880
you know like uh

167
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,560
you don't you don't need to remember his

168
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
face just like see

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,440
if he has a tattoo but obviously like

170
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
this is still kind of forgivable like if

171
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,039
you you know uh

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,639
you could the same way you could just

173
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,400
like take the insignia

174
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
um the jewelry from somewhere some

175
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
someone before you could just like make

176
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,560
make the same tattoo and like try to

177
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,080
peer trying to infringe

178
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,039
someone else um with

179
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,400
ancient rome and um

180
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
and creek we are getting to like more

181
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,840
formalized

182
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,919
um formalized even um

183
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,000
you know like human societies uh in

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,039
general but also

185
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,000
to uh more formalized identity documents

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,800
so this is

187
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
um this is a so-called diploma a

188
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,199
military diploma

189
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,800
uh yearly 200 years before christ um

190
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
where um this this document

191
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,639
is basically a cv of a soldier uh which

192
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,000
just enumerates like

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,759
all of the battles that that person went

194
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,360
to um

195
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,599
basically granting him the citizenship

196
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,880
um

197
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,840
uh of rome uh which then gave him like

198
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
special privileges like

199
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,759
uh being considered a citizen being

200
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,199
exempt from taxes

201
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,120
uh for the military service um

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,680
and being able to like participate on

203
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
the higher society

204
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
um basically like you can you can forge

205
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,759
a document as well

206
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,280
then in 1414 uh we are getting to like a

207
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,490
first type of um

208
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,840
[Music]

209
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,319
like a passporty document where a king

210
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,000
could basically give someone a paper

211
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,800
which

212
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,199
authorizes that person to do acts that

213
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,319
just says well

214
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,120
me as a king there is there is my stem

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,919
my sigil

216
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,599
um i'm calling this person um

217
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,319
whatever citizen gives him certain right

218
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:10,879
um

219
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,800
then again continuously in britain um

220
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
in 1829 uh robert peel started

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,680
um um like obviously he wasn't the

222
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,039
person issuing those numbers but he

223
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,080
started using

224
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,840
personal identification numbers or

225
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,400
suggested those to be used for

226
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,479
uh all citizens of um of the kingdom

227
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,120
um then later on we are going like to a

228
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,240
bit more detail

229
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,360
of what a con like what what an identity

230
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,799
can consist of

231
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,480
um with um negative photography

232
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,080
um in 1840 obviously a whole you know

233
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,399
like a whole new branch of

234
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,440
um identification

235
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,200
um was there to be used so

236
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,560
then with the next uh discovery of

237
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480
fingerprints and the possibility of like

238
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
using those to identify a person

239
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,399
30 years later we obviously get like a

240
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,399
yet new aspect of what

241
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,560
objectively you can you know of the data

242
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,760
set that you can

243
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
kind of gather to identify someone

244
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,640
uh then throughout the 20th century uh

245
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,360
we basically got where we are now like

246
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,160
we went through

247
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,240
physical passports that enabled

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,839
traveling between countries that

249
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,839
um you know had some some sort of an

250
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,839
agreement about like accepting those

251
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,600
we go through like regular passports

252
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
boom now we have everyone has an

253
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
identica are obviously connected with

254
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,440
your

255
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,880
personal id issued by

256
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,839
the local government

257
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
in 1980s there are yet

258
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,680
two new like innovative things being

259
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
introduced

260
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,680
one is the first digital ids um which

261
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,640
uh include a sign-in key where you can

262
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,399
basically

263
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,519
identify yourself digitally and the

264
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,959
interesting part is that we are kind of

265
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,320
like getting back to

266
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,839
well yet now having having an object

267
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,880
for for identification

268
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,279
obviously with biometrical data with

269
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,640
photography

270
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,399
and a whole bunch of other stuff also in

271
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,800
the 80s

272
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,440
the dna profiling started to be used to

273
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,480
identify an individual

274
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,600
um now we get like more up to date

275
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,320
um the buzzwords that you can all um

276
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,680
that you can often hear in connection to

277
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,959
um kind of evolved in a way where

278
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,399
in 1999 you started uh accepting

279
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
electronic signatures for

280
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,279
um for signing official documents in

281
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,480
2001 through

282
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,440
the patriot act uh a thing that we all

283
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,160
love and

284
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,040
adore aml and kyc started being a thing

285
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,880
uh for basically anybody

286
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,000
um in 2007 the uh

287
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,399
psd payment services directives in the

288
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,200
eu

289
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,399
um also like in connection to uh

290
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,000
ml and kyc um kind of shape the way

291
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,399
the state is trying to like utilize the

292
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,360
the fact that they

293
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
uh have the data and can like identify

294
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,240
you online

295
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,680
from from psd um

296
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,959
there's the eides initiative uh which

297
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,959
tries to

298
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,720
kind of bridge the differences between

299
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,079
how like digital line

300
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,880
identities are being used across the eu

301
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,079
2015

302
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,920
uh current like very up-to-date buzzword

303
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,279
psd2

304
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,320
um which is um

305
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
again like an advancement that should

306
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,360
enable

307
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,040
uh also like reusing your identity

308
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,920
between like service providers um in the

309
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,279
banking sector

310
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,399
um and then uh obviously gdpr

311
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,839
uh which kind of

312
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
goes against like all of these because

313
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
this is the point where

314
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,160
people started realizing yeah well maybe

315
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,839
uh if we create these

316
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,920
like huge databases being able to

317
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,959
identify everybody

318
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,760
well that's not always good and maybe we

319
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,560
actually

320
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,880
uh once you kind of keep

321
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,279
some parts of the information for

322
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,320
ourselves

323
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,240
so this is all this all relates to

324
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,519
kind of governmental systems and money

325
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,720
money transfers um but there are there

326
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,360
is also

327
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,079
like throughout the 21st century there

328
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,320
is also like a whole another branch of

329
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,360
how authentication in connection to like

330
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,480
your personal identity is being handled

331
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,360
which is through you know popular

332
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,160
services

333
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,440
uh such as google login uh facebook

334
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,720
login or like any

335
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,600
other service provider that's out there

336
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,040
here locally that would be

337
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,120
my id but i'm certain there are also

338
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,639
like different services

339
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,920
handling the same thing in other

340
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,720
countries um

341
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,120
so yeah these these solutions are kind

342
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,480
of cool right those are not

343
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
those are voluntary like you don't have

344
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,480
to use those services uh you can sign up

345
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,160
you know get uh get an excellent like ux

346
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
benefit because like you don't have to

347
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,680
like every every app like all of a

348
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,959
sudden doesn't have to

349
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,720
build their own identification system

350
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
you can just get some data from

351
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,760
google which is good for the business

352
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,000
uh so um

353
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,320
yeah so obviously there is a there is a

354
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,680
way out of this but

355
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
what this also enabled um because like

356
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,200
these types of login services became

357
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,399
quite popular i'm pretty sure pretty

358
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,079
much like everybody in the room has

359
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,040
ever used those

360
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,639
if not then talk to me later i'm just

361
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,600
interested in like

362
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,199
how you spend your time uh

363
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,959
so um this also made

364
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,639
civil attacks like much easier because

365
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,120
like all of a sudden

366
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,519
there is like an alternative way to how

367
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,160
um

368
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,320
like states tend to identify to people

369
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,120
to just like create your online identity

370
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
picking like whatever service and it

371
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,839
doesn't have to be just google or

372
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,199
facebook right like you can

373
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,320
just go to go to a random forum start

374
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
new nickname uh and you can spin out

375
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,560
like hundreds of these you can have like

376
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,760
a

377
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,079
unique identity for any service that

378
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:24,880
you're using

379
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,320
you can even have like multiple google

380
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,199
logins etc um

381
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,800
so it was all good until like recently

382
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,839
um especially the big providers started

383
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,040
like utilizing

384
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,000
phone numbers as a way to like limit uh

385
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,279
the artificially

386
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,240
created profiles uh that can be used as

387
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,600
a as a cover for

388
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,240
another person uh so it became a bit

389
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,720
harder

390
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,199
now you have to you know get a phone

391
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,560
number

392
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,040
um it's like somewhere it's easier

393
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,880
somewhere it's not

394
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,920
so it's already constraining you um and

395
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,839
now

396
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
you know like now there is actually like

397
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,040
a feasible way

398
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,399
to just live your daily life

399
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,839
uh except for the cases where you

400
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,279
actually like need to sign something to

401
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,399
the government and you have to

402
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,440
like go back to whatever they are

403
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,279
offering you but hey this is a feasible

404
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,560
alternative like

405
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,160
actually like any government government

406
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,360
could just like tap into that and

407
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,800
instead of like building their own layer

408
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,000
they could just like use some of the

409
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,519
service providers right

410
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,440
but we are again getting to like a

411
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,800
corporate surveillance we are getting

412
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,360
into

413
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,040
like these companies utilizing all of

414
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,880
the data they have and

415
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,040
having like the power over your identity

416
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
because they hold your data and now like

417
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,680
linking is back to like gdpr that that's

418
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,519
like a governmental attempt to

419
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,279
you know uh balance the the fact that

420
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,880
they don't actually have as many data as

421
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,279
these companies

422
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,759
um so

423
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,680
especially um in the web 2 contacts with

424
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,240
google auth and like facebook logins um

425
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,720
it's kind of obvious that given like how

426
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,600
many people

427
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,560
use these services uh the the user

428
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,519
experience of like

429
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,279
being able to tap into someone else's

430
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,279
security tap into someone else's

431
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,800
database of users

432
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,320
um and not having to start everything

433
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,480
from scratch again um

434
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,279
has bigger value to people in privacy

435
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:25,759
for

436
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,920
most that's kind of true um luckily like

437
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,519
this is changing these days at least

438
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,000
in central europe you know like there

439
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,079
are events such as this one

440
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,320
but even the companies in the identity

441
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
space that

442
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,279
make surveys and um try to understand

443
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,000
like what

444
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
what the people what the users actually

445
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,440
care about

446
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
figured out that thanks to like

447
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
cambridge analytica and

448
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,360
uh whatever like other types of leagues

449
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,279
people are actually like more aware

450
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,560
of um the the strings attached

451
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,480
and are starting to value their privacy

452
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,240
yet again um now i guess it's kind of

453
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,880
obvious where

454
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,480
where it goes to you um because

455
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,319
with with your governmental identity you

456
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,760
can just have one

457
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,079
most likely there are i guess there are

458
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,520
ways to get

459
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
your second identity somewhere else uh

460
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,119
those are definitely non-trivial

461
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,480
uh if you know those i would be also

462
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,679
interested in like

463
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,760
uh talking about it later um

464
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,120
but um but yeah like as

465
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,600
for i guess for people in the room the

466
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,240
benefit

467
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,919
of not being able to um or

468
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,840
for someone else not being able to

469
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
identify you easily so you can keep your

470
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,480
privacy

471
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,240
is a valuable thing and now we get to

472
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,919
dissociative identity which

473
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
most of you probably already have in

474
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,360
some way

475
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,240
um i don't want you i don't mean i don't

476
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,440
want to make fun of like

477
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
mental illnesses but uh

478
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
when you when you search for like the

479
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
ids the centralized

480
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
identifiers decentralized i need any

481
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,280
standards um

482
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,200
it also matches with um another did

483
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,080
uh the dissociative identity disorder uh

484
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,039
which is basically

485
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,160
multiple personality disorder um

486
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,799
and i mean obviously it's considered an

487
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,840
illness

488
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,960
um an unwanted

489
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,480
state of state of mind but for us

490
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,039
being interested in um keeping your

491
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,240
digital privacy this is actually

492
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,360
something we want

493
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,480
we want exactly we want a disorder right

494
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,559
we we want to we want our image

495
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,120
or an image of our identity to have this

496
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,799
type of disorder where you can

497
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,120
basically maintain different faces for

498
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,639
like different circumstances

499
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,320
also you know being accompanied by a

500
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,160
memory gap like you don't want these

501
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,720
two words to be linked for whatever

502
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,559
reasons

503
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,120
um and this is the this is the point

504
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,840
where

505
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,320
i get to web 3 and uh like the

506
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,799
the technical implementations of

507
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,799
allowing dissociative identities

508
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,280
uh in the digital space um so

509
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,760
well obviously again with like web 2 you

510
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,320
could

511
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
spin up like bunch of your own

512
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,440
identities uh

513
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
it's getting harder these days but it's

514
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,120
still the same type of infrastructure

515
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,840
it's like

516
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,039
the same type of process where you have

517
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,720
a user

518
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,440
the user uses someone else's like server

519
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,039
database to store their

520
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,679
user profiles and then like through that

521
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,360
he interacts with those services and

522
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,120
like these you know there could there

523
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,559
could be like little services you can

524
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,640
connect directly to facebook

525
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,720
just leaving the information with them

526
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,000
or even using

527
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,400
those identification services as proxies

528
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,360
basically telling

529
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,400
facebook to give a subset of your data

530
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,039
to another service provider

531
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,640
and this is the world that we live in

532
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,320
now

533
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
where you basically just have to log in

534
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
information that's all you own

535
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,679
like you don't have the data you have to

536
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,000
ask them like they should give it to you

537
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,679
um but you never know um in the web 3

538
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,240
context

539
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,840
the difference that that the

540
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,120
decentralized identity

541
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,960
standards are based on um

542
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,360
is the fact that in that realm you

543
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
should be the person holding all of your

544
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,120
personal data and you should only allow

545
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,440
services to tap into that without like

546
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
storing the data because they don't

547
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,400
need it unless they use it for some sort

548
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,159
of computation like even then

549
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,880
you could do it like homomorphically but

550
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,159
the service providers like they don't

551
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:48,720
really

552
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,679
need the data right like if you you know

553
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,440
like everybody is ordering stuff online

554
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,400
like on every single website on every

555
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,200
single eshop

556
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,960
you're filling out the same information

557
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,679
all over and over like the address

558
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,240
your credit card numbers if you don't do

559
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,360
it i mean

560
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,039
good for you uh you can even like come

561
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,600
up with

562
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,240
multiple but the fact is like it's just

563
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,799
easier to

564
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,039
like use the man address where you're

565
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,559
certain your packages are going to

566
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,760
arrive

567
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,799
now does like every single eshop needed

568
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,600
information

569
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
do they need to keep it after you're

570
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,200
finished with the purchase

571
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,039
likely not uh but even the architecture

572
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,799
of those services isn't ready for

573
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,799
just like asking for information at the

574
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,120
time they actually need it

575
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,039
and that's that's what's supposed to

576
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,400
change with web3

577
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,679
where the user keeps this user profile

578
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,760
and he just allows services or

579
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,640
credential validators which can be like

580
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,520
other

581
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,400
horrible word kyc providers or

582
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
authentication services

583
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,640
without like ever giving the data away

584
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,200
um

585
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
and that's that's already possible

586
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
that's already possible like with the

587
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,360
technologies that we have

588
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,678
um but it's just a matter of getting

589
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
there

590
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,120
so so the web3 context the paradigm is a

591
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,320
pushback on that old

592
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,840
architecture or the current architecture

593
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,159
um

594
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,360
as i mean as again as it happens like

595
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,240
every now and then

596
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,200
um the point here is to keep those

597
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,720
services

598
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,720
as peer-to-peer as possible um

599
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,400
meaning that um whatever information you

600
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,919
can like

601
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,440
leave at one point and you don't have to

602
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,799
like distribute it anywhere just like

603
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,000
keep it there

604
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,320
um

605
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,840
just as like with your

606
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,600
uh with login info um your

607
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
online presence profile whatever um

608
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,039
all of the you know like if you want to

609
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,720
interact with the service the service

610
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,200
should

611
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,080
just should ask for like a concrete set

612
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,520
of data and it's already happening with

613
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
like google out and stuff

614
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,320
um so the main point is that you should

615
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,760
keep your own data you shouldn't like

616
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,000
leave it with the custodial services the

617
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
same way like you don't do it with

618
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,960
crypto

619
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,679
um and what's what the new paradigm also

620
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,480
allows are

621
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,360
like different types of recoveries

622
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
because like obviously if you

623
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,760
if you own your data you also have the

624
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,280
responsibilities the same

625
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,080
thing with your private keys since this

626
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,520
is also about like maintaining your

627
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,320
private keys

628
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,919
and like all of the info that you want

629
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,760
to share at some point uh you're

630
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
responsible for

631
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
not getting it lost uh and that's why i

632
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
like new

633
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,000
solutions for that that's like social

634
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,520
recovery where you a big bunch of

635
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,440
friends who can then authenticate you

636
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,360
back into the system are being used um

637
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,320
one like subpoint this this leads to

638
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,640
like

639
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,159
creating essential like reputation

640
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,679
systems in different contexts this is

641
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,120
like what a lot of companies are trying

642
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,240
to achieve these days

643
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,760
what's also a new thing is just

644
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,799
provable usage because like in web 3

645
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,880
contacts obviously like everybody has a

646
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,400
everybody has a crypto wallet everybody

647
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
has their set of private keys they know

648
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,679
how to handle it

649
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,200
or they use a custodial service

650
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,640
uh but now with a bunch of these like

651
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,520
keys being used

652
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,799
on chain you actually can use

653
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,600
or can boonstrap like reputation uh

654
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,760
using on-chain data you can just say

655
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,520
well um for instance i only want this

656
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,159
app to be

657
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,159
initially used by by the people that

658
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,880
use like bitcoin before the block x and

659
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,240
you could you could just like get all of

660
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,760
the addresses and basically create a

661
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,440
notification on that

662
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,960
um or just use all

663
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,480
um like a markup proof uh in a contract

664
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,840
to identify to to do it like seamlessly

665
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,600
um so

666
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,760
so yeah uh the what's the hard part like

667
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,840
given given that like everybody here

668
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,679
probably uses crypto has some experience

669
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,039
with that you you know what the

670
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,880
ins and outs are you know what you

671
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
should avoid you should

672
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
you know you know how to protect your

673
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,840
private keys

674
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,360
um but what do you

675
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,200
you know what do you do when when you

676
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,440
just want to like

677
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,279
use another private key and start your

678
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,880
identity um

679
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,799
uh from scratch because like in in the

680
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,799
online world it's it's easier obviously

681
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,000
it's like not so easy

682
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,520
when you want to actually do something

683
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,159
with the government but that's where

684
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,559
where like the additional kyc providers

685
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,440
get to play

686
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,640
um because um

687
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,279
the fact that in in the initial point if

688
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:55,679
you

689
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,720
you know there are these like two

690
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,320
domains like one is the governmental

691
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,679
identification the other one is

692
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,919
the corporate one uh you could probably

693
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
like it could look like the same

694
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
uh but in the beginning the the person

695
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,520
that ky sees you

696
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,120
is obviously the government the official

697
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,600
service uh in the other cases it's like

698
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,720
a corporation

699
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,799
um and most of the identification is

700
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,880
just based on the fact that you

701
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,400
have an email that you have the ability

702
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,200
to get an email

703
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,960
so i mean these images are essentially

704
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,679
the same right

705
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,200
there is like not a huge difference you

706
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
still could have like intermediary

707
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,679
services

708
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,799
uh the big difference is that now when

709
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,559
you can

710
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,679
just like you don't have to you don't

711
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,000
have to

712
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,919
ask for like a personal number right

713
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,200
like you can just pick

714
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,039
any of the any of the private keys out

715
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,200
there you just pick a random number

716
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,520
boom you have a key that can sign stuff

717
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,360
about like your identity

718
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,480
um and uh you can start your

719
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,120
your own thing um you can start like

720
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,720
interacting with the services

721
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,240
um and then it's like up to those

722
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,760
services what types of

723
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,039
authentication they require so if if all

724
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,039
they need is just like knowing that

725
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,000
that address um the private key was used

726
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,159
before a certain blog hash that's easy

727
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,480
if they want you to be like kyc by

728
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,679
another provider

729
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,640
the way the centralized identities uh

730
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,240
according to the did standard handle

731
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,559
this

732
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,840
handles this is that um

733
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,600
you spin out your own like self

734
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,440
sovereign thing which is your private

735
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,600
key or like set of keys

736
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
um then you go to kyc provider

737
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,240
you do the kyc ritual with them whatever

738
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,120
that means

739
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,159
in different contexts and they basically

740
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,960
issue a statement which says well this

741
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,559
set of private keys or like this

742
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,679
particle key

743
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,600
went through our process and with our

744
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,120
key we approved that it actually

745
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,240
happened and then it's again

746
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,960
on depending on the the service provider

747
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,559
it depends on them if they are

748
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,480
if they're if they decide to accept this

749
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,960
type of authentication

750
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,279
um so

751
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,840
this is obviously a lot of work um and

752
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,440
for

753
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,600
for your second identity for your alter

754
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,919
ego to be actually useful

755
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,360
um you you have to decide like which

756
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
types of services do you use with like

757
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,000
your

758
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,559
your own like new bootstrap uh social

759
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,399
brand identity in which you

760
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,240
uh which you associate with the one that

761
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,559
for instance like went through a kyc

762
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,880
um the one point which i figured to

763
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,919
mention is that

764
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,200
um none of these like interactions and

765
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,880
this is where the like the peer-to-peer

766
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,000
part comes in

767
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,840
needs to be public right like all of

768
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,200
these claims all of all of the

769
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,799
identification that happens between the

770
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,320
service provider and you and between

771
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,960
like these

772
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,679
parties like those can remain offline

773
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,960
like you don't you can decide

774
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,840
never to publish them unless unless you

775
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,039
want to use them

776
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,679
for authenticating with someone else

777
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:52,320
this doesn't

778
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,840
this doesn't need like any you know

779
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,240
anything being public and you can just

780
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
decide like

781
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,360
individually like what the rules should

782
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,520
be

783
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,559
so the hard problem is like keeping this

784
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,080
consistent because

785
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,840
it's it's like super easy i'm sure it

786
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,600
also happened to you just like

787
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,240
you want to keep one of your addresses

788
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,600
private but boom then you

789
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,240
like accidentally or not accidentally

790
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,760
just like need the money to transfer

791
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,840
somewhere else and boom you you

792
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,080
uh reveal like the entire track of your

793
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,679
like bitcoin transactions or like

794
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,360
whatever crypto are you using

795
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,640
so that's that's a hard problem um

796
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,559
i guess there is no solution for that uh

797
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,559
so if you if you are actually aware of

798
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,240
of these types of solutions that

799
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,679
services that kind of

800
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,760
take care of certain aspects of like

801
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,679
keeping your identity separate

802
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,440
um please share those um

803
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,919
i'm not sure how much time we have um

804
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,760
cool what i want to encourage you

805
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,320
is to like start your alter egos now uh

806
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:04,799
if you

807
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,240
if you have a way um

808
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,840
to um get yourself kyc then like

809
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,000
bunch of different names uh you should

810
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,600
do it as soon as possible because as you

811
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,640
could see

812
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,440
throughout the evolution of

813
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,840
authentication and

814
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,480
identities um in the beginning it was

815
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,919
quite easy to

816
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,520
just like have have two separate

817
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,960
identities right you could just have

818
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,120
different like jewelries you could have

819
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,360
like different types of documents but it

820
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
was getting increasingly harder to

821
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,960
to do that with those corporate

822
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,120
identification services and the fact

823
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,279
that those are being so popular that

824
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,320
you can even like use them to uh to

825
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,879
handle money

826
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
um you can still achieve it to some

827
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,679
extent but it will like tomorrow it will

828
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,760
get again a bit harder than today and

829
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,120
if you if you kind of

830
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,519
maintain consistent identities that

831
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,720
are for instance like utilizable in the

832
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,679
id standard

833
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,039
um to which we'll get a bit later

834
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,240
then even that set of data that identity

835
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,559
has

836
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,039
has value so if you if you like create

837
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,720
artificial identities that

838
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,440
uh which basically can be any set of you

839
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,960
know aspects it can be like having

840
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,600
multiple

841
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,000
gmail accounts maintaining like multiple

842
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,880
numbers

843
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,679
um kind of creating consistent track of

844
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,000
like

845
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,240
appearing to be somewhere else not being

846
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,200
you

847
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,600
that's valuable i'm quite certain that

848
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,320
uh

849
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,120
you could even like buy identities now

850
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,760
um

851
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,600
but i'm certain that in the future you

852
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,279
will actually have like a whole market

853
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,279
for trading your

854
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,679
set of keys that people used and like

855
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,200
reputation systems and

856
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,000
um you know use for certain services and

857
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,679
you'll be able to like

858
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,240
get someone else's name uh for a while

859
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,480
and then decide sell it as well

860
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,200
depending if it has any value to anybody

861
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,080
so

862
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,159
a lot of the identity stuff just to wrap

863
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,200
up is

864
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,880
connected to standardization because

865
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,480
like obviously like we cannot use an

866
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,159
identification service

867
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,440
um if if we are like the only person

868
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,640
using that then we are

869
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,000
back to where we were and especially in

870
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,240
the context of decentralized

871
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,679
uh identifiers um there is a

872
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,840
there is a big group of people working

873
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,919
on specifying and implementing

874
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,080
implementing the standard

875
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,480
uh there is like a lot of a lot of stuff

876
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,600
to read

877
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
on that note i definitely wouldn't go

878
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,440
through that um

879
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,039
there are even like implementations that

880
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,720
are completely unchained for instance on

881
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,880
ethereum the erc 720 to

882
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,279
uh 725 735 is basically

883
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,720
um a code implementation of what i was

884
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,240
just talking about like the

885
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,080
the standardization already happened to

886
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,440
some to some extent

887
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
and now depending on like the service

888
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,480
providers

889
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,159
having the willingness to start

890
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,919
utilizing these services

891
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,480
um and that's just a matter of adoption

892
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,200
right

893
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,399
the trends that are kind of obvious um

894
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,240
are utilization of zero knowledge proofs

895
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,640
and

896
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,720
like whatever is on chain when i go to

897
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,000
like the uh

898
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,440
the blockchain specific part um

899
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,240
and even more interesting is just

900
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,159
identification based on ownership and we

901
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,360
just like recently

902
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,679
uh had a quick chat about this this is

903
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,279
kind of like a digital re

904
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,080
introduction of out of authenticating

905
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,519
with a physical object

906
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,200
like jewelry uh like now again you can

907
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,159
you can own an nft like a non-fungible

908
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:40,799
token

909
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,519
which can which can be used for you to

910
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,679
be authenticated with a service

911
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,799
um but you can also decide to just like

912
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,840
sell this nft to someone else uh and now

913
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,279
whoever owns that

914
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,279
whoever holds that token is the king

915
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,559
[Music]

916
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,760
so as the last part a shameless plug of

917
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,679
some of the things connected to this

918
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,120
place in particle

919
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,719
um if you're interested in the

920
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,520
the very like technical specifics of uh

921
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,719
the ids

922
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,760
um i would definitely encourage you to

923
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,560
um to reach out to this group or

924
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,239
rebooting the web of trust

925
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,719
uh parallel nipples was lucky enough to

926
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,839
to host the

927
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,079
um the last workshop that happened

928
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,679
i don't know when some sometime last

929
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,599
year uh two other things that i wanted

930
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,760
to mention

931
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,560
citizen k is one of the uh one of the

932
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,239
art pieces by stovan

933
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,280
uh there is even like a documentary uh

934
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,399
which basically 10 years ago

935
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,480
deals with the topics that now are

936
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,599
getting implemented

937
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,719
the fact that you can uh create um

938
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,199
like a merch identity and just kind of

939
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,960
swap it as you as you go

940
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,839
uh so i definitely encourage you to um

941
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,200
look at that

942
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,440
and another thing which i found out

943
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,560
about during

944
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,960
hackers congress in like 2017 i don't

945
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,680
know

946
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,480
it's a documentary by dylan reibling

947
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,920
which is called looking for mike

948
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,320
uh and that part was kind of very

949
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,079
revealing for me it's like a 30-minute

950
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,440
documentary i think it's

951
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,720
available online that one is about his

952
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,680
friend

953
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,800
who who passed away and after it

954
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
happened

955
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,359
dylan actually found out that the person

956
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,599
wasn't the person who he said he was so

957
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,079
that guy was using a fake identity for

958
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,920
several years and created like a

959
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,200
whole new life story um and for me

960
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,800
the documentary was especially

961
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,400
interesting because it just like shows

962
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,720
you

963
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,880
how you really cannot trust people

964
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,040
because like you know

965
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,920
even if you knew them for you know six

966
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,359
years

967
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,079
um that was it thank you for coming to

968
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,040
the talk if you want to

969
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,640
chat about that later i'll be happy i

970
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,400
wasn't sure like how deep can we go but

971
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,680
we can even talk about

972
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,720
the erc implementations

973
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,180
does anyone have any questions

974
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:11,359
[Applause]

975
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,240
okay thank you josef so we have about

976
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,680
eight or nine minutes for

977
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,960
questions um i guess we can take some

978
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,119
from the room i saw one hand are you

979
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,839
okay all right

980
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,200
i was going to oppose your first point

981
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,839
that

982
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,720
isn't smell the first way to identify

983
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,040
other individuals even before our

984
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,480
vision was good enough to do it even

985
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,240
outside humans but that's another

986
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,079
question my question is

987
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,839
how do you think we can prevent identity

988
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:48,400
theft

989
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,520
in a world where the identity that you

990
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,880
use is no longer

991
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,160
connected to your physical uh

992
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,640
being things um

993
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,560
well um i mean there is like a

994
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,839
always a trade-off right

995
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,920
if we if we try to completely avoid like

996
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,119
identity theft

997
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,520
uh we'll probably go in in a way of like

998
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,359
trying to

999
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,119
strong in the connection between your

1000
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,280
digital identity and your like physical

1001
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,119
self right like having i don't know like

1002
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,800
dna records

1003
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,119
as claims connected to your to your

1004
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,480
identity and again having like a

1005
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,000
maintainer having like a

1006
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,400
surveillance who who knows the truth um

1007
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,440
so i'm not i'm not really sure like this

1008
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,720
should be

1009
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,240
like generally prevented because that

1010
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,839
will also mean that the chance for

1011
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,760
getting your second identity

1012
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,200
is much lower um for me it's

1013
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,359
it the core of the question is like um

1014
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,800
you know are you are you cautious and

1015
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,839
do you care about your privacy

1016
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,280
to the extent that you're willing to

1017
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,040
like handle your private keys yourself

1018
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,800
because it ultimately goes down to

1019
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,640
whoever has the signing right

1020
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,400
to the information because that's where

1021
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,839
we are heading

1022
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,940
in my opinion so um

1023
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,320
[Music]

1024
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,880
if if you want to prevent like privacy

1025
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,520
theft in

1026
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,160
in that realm just store your private

1027
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,799
key safely

1028
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,440
uh but that's that's connected right i

1029
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,520
was i was actually concerned about the

1030
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,720
situation because like i

1031
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,520
am one of those uh stupid human beings

1032
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,000
that will definitely not be able to

1033
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
remember all of my information that i

1034
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,079
use to access various services

1035
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,640
so i have the choice of either writing

1036
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,760
down everything on

1037
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,079
a paper which is extremely unofficial

1038
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,200
and efficient

1039
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,400
or exposing myself to the danger that

1040
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,839
somebody will steal my

1041
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,839
information so i am sure that

1042
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,599
this way like if we if we uh

1043
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,720
we will inevitably expose ourselves to

1044
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,960
the danger of somebody stealing

1045
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,240
every our online whole online personal

1046
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,359
from us because

1047
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,400
we do not have any way

1048
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,560
of ensuring that it will be always

1049
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,920
connected to us

1050
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,440
yeah right um i guess that depends on

1051
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,520
again on the like the way to like access

1052
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,920
that information that you use for

1053
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,160
logins i mean like now you use logins in

1054
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,000
my opinion you're going to in several

1055
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,680
years you're just going to use private

1056
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,560
keys

1057
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,680
even for logins uh because like you

1058
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,839
don't really need logins

1059
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,880
um so

1060
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,200
i i mean in that way for me it goes down

1061
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,119
to how you protect your private keys

1062
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,320
because like i don't think the

1063
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,240
identification as you know it now with

1064
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,839
like email and password will stay here

1065
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,960
for long

1066
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,019
[Music]

1067
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,480
yeah but i think i essentially think

1068
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,000
this is the way i think like the

1069
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,119
way is to uh you know get rid of like

1070
00:39:59,119 --> 00:39:59,440
the

1071
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,200
the two-way identification system just

1072
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,880
like leave it on

1073
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,079
on a secure key that's um

1074
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,040
that anyone can get you know um you

1075
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,240
don't because like that login

1076
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,079
information is still in the database of

1077
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:12,480
the

1078
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,920
of the identification service of the

1079
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,079
service provider uh but i think we are

1080
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,560
getting away from that

1081
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,520
to like a you know like a leaner set of

1082
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,319
keys that you can then use instead of

1083
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,359
that type of login

1084
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,520
it but yeah the thing is it can

1085
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,319
and it doesn't have to you can you can

1086
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,440
still

1087
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,960
keep a lot of privacy um but you can you

1088
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,480
can also distributed knowledge about

1089
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,599
like how these keys are

1090
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,520
connected it just depends on you like

1091
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,119
what's the part that you're comfortable

1092
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,319
with revealing

1093
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,480
um and with having like even multiple of

1094
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,079
those identities you can decide like

1095
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,920
what needs to be connected what needs to

1096
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,839
be you and what what

1097
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,920
what's the set of data that can be your

1098
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,000
alter ego

1099
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,119
okay can we try one more question yeah

1100
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,240
okay so if

1101
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,560
if in the context of what three you only

1102
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,400
need to sign uh

1103
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,319
to provide a signature that you are

1104
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,160
having a

1105
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,960
key that you are the imposition of a key

1106
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,760
what is this

1107
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,319
erc

1108
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,359
yeah is it doing this it's like yes

1109
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,520
processing a signature or it has some

1110
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,040
fancy special features

1111
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,119
uh so those contracts are basically just

1112
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,920
the standard interface that the apps can

1113
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,119
then use

1114
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,520
uh to utilize that as for like

1115
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,200
authentication or for

1116
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,240
passing over some of the data uh so it

1117
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,680
basically the contract

1118
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,920
is is a definition of like how do you

1119
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,720
it's just a

1120
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,480
it's just a formatting standard of like

1121
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,880
how you store the information about the

1122
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,800
the keys because you can you you start

1123
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,200
with like one key right but you can by

1124
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,359
uh by using that key to

1125
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,839
for signing transactions toward if if

1126
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,680
that's in the case of a contract

1127
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,119
for signing transactions towards the

1128
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,440
contract you can like add multiple

1129
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,520
keys that you can you know you don't

1130
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,880
even have to reveal those you can just

1131
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,560
like publish hashes of those keys just

1132
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,599
so you can then

1133
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,079
if someone asks you you know you want to

1134
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,440
identificate and you send them like a

1135
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,160
bucket

1136
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,040
bucket with data saying hey this is a

1137
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,000
this is that

1138
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,720
authentication service telling it's me

1139
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
it's like i possess like this

1140
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,240
set of parameters so you can

1141
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,920
authenticate me because that's what the

1142
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,280
service requires

1143
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,760
how do they know how do they know like

1144
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,359
it actually originates

1145
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,240
with from like one point or it's

1146
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,440
associated with whatever you're like

1147
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,960
sending them right now like whichever

1148
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,440
key you're using so there is this like

1149
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,040
um list of like public keys that you i

1150
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,800
mean the same way you publish your

1151
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,920
a pgp fingerprint to an attacher right

1152
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,839
uh you can just like have multiple of

1153
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,119
those and say

1154
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,720
well that's me i'm signing it with this

1155
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,319
key uh have a look

1156
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,680
there like to blockchain for instance uh

1157
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,000
to verify that it's actually me and this

1158
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,440
can happen

1159
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,040
off-chain right this just happens like

1160
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,480
peer-to-peer and they can

1161
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,839
have a look into like a central database

1162
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:14,720
in this case

1163
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,880
uh to verify what the association that

1164
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,079
you're telling them there

1165
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,359
it exists actually exists okay

1166
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,200
thank you okay i think that might be it

1167
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,000
for q a

1168
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,040
right we

1169
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,480
okay we have one on the stream

1170
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,839
okay do i okay i'm gonna read this all

1171
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,839
right

1172
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,880
okay uh is there a way to use an alter

1173
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,119
ego in a kyc

1174
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,599
request i assume as some sort of

1175
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,359
authentication with kyc

1176
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,560
yeah uh that that's a good question i

1177
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,520
would like to

1178
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,920
know where it's possible the easiest i

1179
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,960
think like for instance

1180
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,680
as i mentioned as i mentioned the

1181
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,480
citizen k

1182
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,640
document that's where you kind of can

1183
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,200
see that it in some ways it's possible

1184
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,800
and um you know like still a lot of the

1185
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,000
stuff that we

1186
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
that we deal with on a daily basis is

1187
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
just based on like different

1188
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,599
different nations these different states

1189
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,520
having like certain contracts and

1190
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,359
certain types of acceptances between

1191
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,160
themselves

1192
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,560
so for instance uh and like these days

1193
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,440
for effective area reasons um the things

1194
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
like eides are basically trying to

1195
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,359
like reutilize your kyc for like

1196
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,960
different purposes

1197
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,040
so once you find once you find like your

1198
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,640
heck into the system

1199
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,240
uh then um you could probably achieve

1200
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,680
like having like a good

1201
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,000
second track with strong kyc like

1202
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,280
it's not the best example but um

1203
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,640
i believe like in the us uh if you

1204
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,800
uh you can you can just be kyc like by

1205
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,640
one bank in order to get

1206
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,839
um uh to get an account win another one

1207
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,200
so you can either go through like the

1208
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,839
kyc that the bank provides or you can

1209
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,359
tell them hey there is already another

1210
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,200
subject that already did that

1211
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,760
and through that appeal uh you will

1212
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,119
basically be considered

1213
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,079
fine for them uh so whenever you find

1214
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,280
like

1215
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,240
the the weakest uh part of the chain

1216
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,760
that's where you can enter

1217
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,920
uh and this doesn't have to be like this

1218
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,280
doesn't have to be in one state right

1219
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,359
again we can probably go to

1220
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,720
um i don't know where and gets uh

1221
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,079
get a passport uh um

1222
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,400
and use that to somehow like bootstrap

1223
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,240
that alter ego

1224
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,560
so i'm i don't know like what the one

1225
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,240
way would be i wouldn't definitely

1226
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,599
say it uh even if i knew

1227
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,720
okay i think that's it then for q a okay

1228
00:45:48,720 --> 00:46:01,839
thank you very much jose
