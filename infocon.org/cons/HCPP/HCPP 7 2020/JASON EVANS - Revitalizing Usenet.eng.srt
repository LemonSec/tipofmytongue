00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,120
[Applause]

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,000
uh

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,200
my name is jason evans i am a

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,040
training engineer for susa linux here in

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,320
prague

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,000
i'm a board member for the big eight

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
management board or the

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,560
bambi's as we're sometimes called i'm a

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,279
proj

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,840
volunteer for the tour project and i'm

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,359
an all-around nerd i've got a lot of

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,439
nerdy interests use net tour privacy

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,238
that kind of thing so we're going to

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,680
begin with kind of a technical

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,320
definition of what is usenet

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,239
usenet is a worldwide distributed

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,320
discussion network it is the

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,360
original long-form messaging system that

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,920
predates the internet as we know it

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,440
now i'm going to give you the not

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,520
technical definition

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,360
usenet is like a herd of performing

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
elephants with diarrhea

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,840
massive difficult to redirect all

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,960
inspiring

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,879
entertaining and a source of

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,640
mind-boggling amounts of excrement when

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,199
you least expect it

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,600
so how does it work users read and send

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,479
articles

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,600
or messages we might think of to a new

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,080
server

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
the server exchanges them articles with

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
other new servers in the network

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,920
and the collection is called the usenet

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,759
some of the benefits are that it's open

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,960
everything about the usernet is

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
completely open

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,960
um from the transport protocols to the

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,000
software

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,680
it's decentralized every usenet server

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,880
is a thing unto itself there is no

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,200
central use net as long as there's at

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,240
least

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,159
one usenet server around there's still a

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,439
usenet

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,920
it doesn't matter who comes in and

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
destroy and shuts down what

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
you can't you have a really hard time

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,600
shutting it down it's simple

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,920
usenet is kind of like a cross between

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,119
email

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,520
and a message board like reddit and the

54
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
fact that it is

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,119
it's a way to communicate on lots of

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,119
different topics but it's also simple

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:01:59,759
it's all

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,960
plain text messages so anybody can just

59
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,840
back it up

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,360
and not have to worry about getting

61
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,439
access to some kind of central database

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,119
right now if you go to archive.org you

63
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,038
can find sent message archives all the

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,599
way back to the early 80s

65
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,520
because it's really really simple to do

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,920
this it's owned by no one

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,360
there is no central authorization

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
authority for usenet now there are

69
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,239
companies who sell access to usenet

70
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,280
but nobody has say in what happens

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
it's resilient as i just said no matter

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
what happens to

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,200
one or even 100 different servers you

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,160
can't just

75
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,640
kill usenet finally it's resistance to

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,920
censorship

77
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,400
every usenet server has a copy of every

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
message

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,560
if some assist admin decides they don't

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,080
like what's happening on this group

81
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,200
they don't like what this person's

82
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,480
saying they can delete it from their

83
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,200
server

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,599
they cannot delete it from usenet all

85
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,640
the other servers are still going to

86
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,958
have it

87
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,200
so usenet is divided into what are

88
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,440
called news groups each group is

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,680
generally a topic for discussion for

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,519
that group news groups are organized

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,720
into hierarchies

92
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,360
for example bitcoin is in the alt

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
hierarchy and you can't see it

94
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,720
but comp dot com dot psi

95
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,879
is in the comp uh um hierarchy

96
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,560
so these are the big eight news groups

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,920
these are the uh

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,640
descendants of the original news groups

99
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,840
comp

100
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
oh that didn't show up right um

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,799
okay uh so there is like there is a list

102
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,239
of big eight news groups unfortunately

103
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,239
the slide isn't showing right

104
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,480
but these are the original this is what

105
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,239
my group the big eight management board

106
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,920
are responsible for

107
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,560
and what we do is we create well-named

108
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,680
well-used

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,599
news groups in these high in this big

110
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,519
hierarchies

111
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,040
we make necessary adjustments to

112
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,720
existing groups

113
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,959
we remove groups that are not well used

114
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,400
and we assist and encourage

115
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,680
um servers to use the canonical

116
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,560
group if some server server admin didn't

117
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,239
want to carry a specific group

118
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,879
that's fine we can't make them but if

119
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,760
somebody's

120
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,720
is just not updating or we're removing

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,319
groups as we as we

122
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,799
as we organize them we try to work with

123
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,360
them

124
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
we can't make anybody do anything but we

125
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
try to work with them to try to keep

126
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,279
everything

127
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,560
keep everybody on the same line

128
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,880
so a little history about using it in

129
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,639
1980

130
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,720
there was no use net and there was only

131
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,919
the arpanet

132
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,400
and very few had access the arpanet was

133
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
a program set up by the us government

134
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
between the military

135
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,360
and certain universities on the west

136
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,960
coast namely in silicon valley

137
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
and these universities would be able to

138
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
talk to each other through this arpanet

139
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
and to the government and so they can

140
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,120
have research projects together

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,479
but unless you had political connections

142
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,800
and about a hundred thousand dollars you

143
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
couldn't get

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
connection to this arpanet and this is

145
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
hundred thousand dollars in 1980 monies

146
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
which is closer to a half a million

147
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,560
today

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
and the email was already around

149
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,639
but let's say you're at a university and

150
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,919
you're you have a local

151
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,680
mainframe you could send email to other

152
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,120
people on your mainframe

153
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
but to send messages to and from other

154
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,240
schools

155
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,880
or other places was impossible unless

156
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,639
you're already on the arpanet

157
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,360
so two two schools duke university and

158
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,960
the university of north carolina chapel

159
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,600
hill

160
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,919
had just installed the new unix version

161
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,600
7 on their pdp-11

162
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,960
mini computers this is actually a

163
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,360
picture of them this um

164
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,560
this right here is a mini computer

165
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
um and you can see it here a little bit

166
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,919
also

167
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,280
um this unix version 7

168
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,479
had a new system called use ucp or unix

169
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,680
unix copy

170
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,080
and by using telephone lines modems they

171
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,120
were able to send

172
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
messages from one unix system to another

173
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
unix system

174
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,720
so there's finally communication between

175
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,639
machines

176
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,759
and um what they would do

177
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,400
is uh they set up the system that they

178
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,039
called net news or usenet

179
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,360
and so students from one suit from one's

180
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,440
mission

181
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
students from one school would send

182
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
messages to the other school

183
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,039
and that school would get a copy of all

184
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,360
the messages students could reply back

185
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,199
and send back messages and so everybody

186
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,639
had a copy of all the messages

187
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,310
in go and keep on going

188
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,960
[Music]

189
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,800
okay in 1980

190
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,280
um these students from from the

191
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,479
university of north carolina

192
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,919
and um and duke university they went to

193
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,440
the unix conference

194
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,960
and they made a presentation about what

195
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
they had been doing and

196
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
the growth growth had been significant

197
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
uh you can't see my table here for

198
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
whatever reason

199
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,280
but um every year hundreds

200
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,400
of new schools new organizations had

201
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,160
signed up to join this year's net thing

202
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,199
it just grew dramatically

203
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,160
at the end of 1981 this is what usernet

204
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,759
looked like

205
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,280
these were all different machines at

206
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,319
different schools even microsoft up here

207
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
they were on it and and

208
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
from just two schools

209
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,638
at the end of 1979 to

210
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,880
closer to 30 at the end of 1981.

211
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,880
this is used in 1993.

212
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,039
you can see mostly united states europe

213
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,000
also australia south america even a few

214
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
in africa

215
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,319
and japan uh this was you know

216
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,160
really just took off in a major sort of

217
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,639
way by this point of course there was an

218
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,360
internet

219
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
and so it got much easier to access it

220
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,639
but you could

221
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,479
but this was pretty much the heyday of

222
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,599
the classical use net

223
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,039
i don't know uh

224
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,879
this is just the map that i found and i

225
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,240
have no idea why they didn't actually

226
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,800
make

227
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
they have dots but they don't have

228
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,400
connections i couldn't tell you why

229
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,160
maybe so maybe so

230
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,960
okay so we're going to talk about this

231
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,240
starting to begin at the end

232
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,520
in 1993 america online which was the

233
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,680
largest internet service provider in the

234
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,279
united states at the time

235
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,640
decided to offer usenet uh

236
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,919
to uh to those customers now prior to

237
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,640
this

238
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,080
again most users were universities uh

239
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,399
university students grad students and

240
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,160
some businesses

241
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
every september new freshmen would come

242
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,519
to the university

243
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,519
they would get on this using that thing

244
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,640
make a racket for

245
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
about a month and then finally the

246
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
experienced users would kind of

247
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,640
adopt them teach them how to use

248
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,160
netiquette which is the etiquette of the

249
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,360
net

250
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,839
and um and things would be going would

251
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,040
be well again until

252
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,800
september when aol

253
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
launched usenet he became the eternal

254
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
september

255
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,519
there is now no way to uh to really

256
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
educate all of these new users on how to

257
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
use usenet

258
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,200
and so people got burned out really

259
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,839
quickly

260
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,120
because um whereas before it was mostly

261
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,480
polite conversation there was a lot of

262
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,120
stupidity

263
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
also but mostly it was polite

264
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
conversation really great exchange of

265
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,640
ideas

266
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
but now there was just no way to kind of

267
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,959
handle the influx of new users

268
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
in 2001 just a few years later

269
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
google buys a company called deja news

270
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
deja news had been

271
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,519
a web-based usernet provider and they

272
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:51,839
had

273
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,320
archives all the way back from the early

274
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,080
days of usenet

275
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,760
google created a service called google

276
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
news

277
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,040
and that service is still available

278
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,560
today but the

279
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,279
problem is google now nor have they ever

280
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,240
done any kind of spam filtering so

281
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,800
anyone

282
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,360
right now can go onto google groups find

283
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,800
a news group and start typing

284
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,120
and or set up a bot or set up a spam a

285
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
spam bot whatever

286
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,720
and spam the hell out of usenet there's

287
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,519
nothing stopping them

288
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,560
then a couple years later aol decides

289
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,760
you know what nobody's using this use

290
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,880
net thing anymore we're just going to

291
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,320
drop service

292
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,680
and this is kind of like the beginning

293
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,640
of of how we stopped we stopped seeing

294
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,240
uh support for usenet

295
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,040
in 2008 three of the top use net

296
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,000
providers

297
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,640
just dropped drop use nut the us

298
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,600
government found out

299
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,040
that some news groups work what are

300
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,200
called binary news groups binaries are

301
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,160
ones that actually

302
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
uh allow you to send pictures and data

303
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,640
and whatever rather than just plain text

304
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,440
there's child pornography there rather

305
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,760
than

306
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,720
worrying about trying to please use net

307
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,360
which is

308
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,440
impossible because again if you take it

309
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,800
off one server you can't take it off all

310
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,839
the servers

311
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,519
they decided just to stop offering the

312
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,440
service altogether

313
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,680
so now um if you're with one of these

314
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,519
big isps

315
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,959
you couldn't get access anymore unless

316
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,399
you went to another service or you

317
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,240
bought independent service

318
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,560
um local uh internet service providers

319
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
also stopped for providing it

320
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,440
so it was just you know just going down

321
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,279
a couple years later duke university one

322
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,720
of those first schools that

323
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,279
actually invented usenet dropped our own

324
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,680
service

325
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,200
and we're going to talk about one of the

326
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
biggest problems here and i've already

327
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,000
alluded to this already

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
this is spam now i will admit i cherry

329
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,600
picked this

330
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,360
this um screenshot but this is a real

331
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,640
screenshot

332
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,600
of spam on usenet this right here is

333
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,120
probably the only message that is not

334
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,760
spam

335
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,040
and that's actually from a bot the thing

336
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,920
with usenet

337
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,440
is that since there is no overall

338
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,240
authority to handle usenet it's up to

339
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,360
the user

340
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,160
to block anything they don't want to see

341
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,240
and users today

342
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,000
don't like that they expect somebody

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,680
else to do that for them

344
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,440
you can see here what what i've done is

345
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,120
i uh on this program that i use called

346
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,839
pan

347
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,200
you can award a score to things with um

348
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,959
with um to articles that that you may or

349
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,160
may not want to see most of these are

350
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,639
drug

351
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,399
drug spam so i started making um

352
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,079
filters so that anything that had like a

353
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,440
drug description

354
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,279
i would start blocking or i'd give them

355
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,440
a low score and then i can just filter

356
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,240
it out

357
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
and after you do this using it as much

358
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,920
more usable but

359
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,440
um but this turns a lot of people off

360
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,560
when they're expecting somebody else to

361
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,880
do it for them there are moderated

362
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,560
groups on usenet and they're not

363
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,760
difficult to set up but they're not

364
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,800
that prevalent either now truth be told

365
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,399
this is from two this is the screenshots

366
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,639
from 2019

367
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,720
in the last probably year year and a

368
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,519
half the span problem has gotten better

369
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,920
mostly because those spam bots have just

370
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,880
gone away

371
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,000
there's no need to um spam username

372
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,959
anymore because

373
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,800
they don't see any kind of return on

374
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,959
them

375
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,560
this is the use net as of april this

376
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,800
year

377
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,680
it's not that giant web that we saw from

378
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,040
1993

379
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,920
but it's not exactly small either a lot

380
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,079
of these are corporate entities uh you

381
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,920
can't really see it but google's up here

382
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,600
that's their service

383
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,120
a lot of these are companies who sell

384
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
you know use net service and a lot of

385
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
them are people like me who are

386
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
hobbyists who set up their own server

387
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,839
just to help be a part of the network

388
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,519
and also to get their own copy of

389
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,880
everything that's happening on usenet

390
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,600
from a discussion i had earlier this

391
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,880
year

392
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,680
it was about one gigabyte per month of

393
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,160
bandwidth

394
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,639
so um in 2014

395
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,480
most of the previous members of the big

396
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,160
eight management board had stepped down

397
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,399
or just had their membership slaps and

398
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,680
they didn't have anybody to take up the

399
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,160
reins

400
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,399
so they just kind of just let it go

401
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,639
at that so without them there's no new

402
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,720
no new scriptures could be created

403
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
none could be removed and of course

404
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,160
nothing can be changed to existing

405
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
groups

406
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,480
what's that

407
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,680
um the way they authenticated is that

408
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,800
there's something called a control

409
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,959
message a control message is signed with

410
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,920
a gpg key

411
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
and as long as the different servers are

412
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,279
um recognize that gpg

413
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,639
key that's how they authenticated

414
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,959
of course only the members had access to

415
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,680
the private key

416
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
okay a few months ago

417
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
i wrote this open letter to reddit i had

418
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,199
sent it to the

419
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,519
ford email address which i kind of

420
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,720
expected to be bounced back but it

421
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,519
didn't

422
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,680
so i wrote this email and then i posted

423
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
to reddit as just an open letter

424
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,480
and i asked what's the status is um

425
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,800
can is there is there still a board

426
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,720
what's happening with it

427
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,399
and surprisingly i actually did get some

428
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,240
responses um

429
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,079
at the same time another person had done

430
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,440
the same thing

431
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,560
my colleague tristan miller and

432
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,079
we were both trying to get information

433
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,759
on the board at the same time

434
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,600
shortly after contacting the board we

435
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
were asked hey do you guys want to just

436
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,040
take it over from us because we're not

437
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,120
going to do anything with it

438
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
and they asked us to write a little bit

439
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,639
about ourselves and what we have plans

440
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,839
for the board

441
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,160
and i wrote this um i want to see it

442
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,519
staffed again

443
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,839
i want to see uh contacts made with

444
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,519
usernet providers to see that

445
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,040
the big management board is actually

446
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,880
accepted and to begin

447
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,800
receiving rft's rfds or requests for

448
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,920
discussion

449
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,839
to create new groups or to remove groups

450
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,399
etc

451
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,959
on april 30th the previous

452
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,240
members posted

453
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,720
to this moderated group saying that

454
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
tristan and i are now

455
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,480
the new members where they saw the board

456
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,800
members

457
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,240
over the next few weeks we set up a new

458
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,160
web server and mail server the old

459
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
web server crashed like two weeks after

460
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,480
we took over just from a hardware

461
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,000
failure

462
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,160
and so we were we were down a website

463
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
for a while

464
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,880
and then in july we added a third person

465
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,440
in

466
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
to kind of be a balancing force so in

467
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,560
case uh

468
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,880
chris and i had a disagreement we would

469
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,720
have like a two-thirds agreement

470
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,759
rather than um rather than just us

471
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,440
being deadlocked from each other

472
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,120
and this is our current website it's

473
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,560
currently up and running

474
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,160
we try to keep it up to date with uh

475
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,000
with good information we have a meeting

476
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
every friday

477
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,160
and we post all of our meeting notes and

478
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,720
minutes

479
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
onto the website because we want to be

480
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,640
as transparent as possible

481
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,439
with what we're doing

482
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,400
so why are we doing this does anybody

483
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,559
even care about using it anymore

484
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,079
and why should anybody care

485
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,280
why are we doing this because usenet has

486
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,319
a really

487
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,039
wonderful history this isn't just

488
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,400
nostalgia

489
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,840
we think that the pros of usenet

490
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,360
outweigh the cons especially the

491
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
decentralized nature

492
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
the fact that it's incredibly difficult

493
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,039
to to

494
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,200
censor it the fact that it's actually

495
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,480
pretty anonymous

496
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,520
when you post on usenet your provider

497
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,120
might have a username and password for

498
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,200
you but they don't have to know who you

499
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
are

500
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,039
what some of the free um some of the

501
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,480
free providers that i use

502
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,559
even let me sign up with tor i mean they

503
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,120
just don't care

504
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,400
this is you know this is really great

505
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,120
for people who want to converse

506
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,080
but they

507
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,679
don't they don't necessarily need to let

508
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,760
people know who they are

509
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,160
does anybody care anymore yes there are

510
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,840
lots of active news groups there are

511
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,600
news groups that i wouldn't even expect

512
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,480
to be active

513
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,640
there's a pdp-11 which is one of those

514
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,480
old uh

515
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
mainframe news groups that is still

516
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,559
active they still got like 20 or

517
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,039
30 messages a day who knew

518
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,720
um but yeah people are still using

519
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,559
usenet

520
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,720
and should anybody care yeah i think so

521
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,679
i think

522
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,600
i think if the people who care more

523
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,720
about communication

524
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,840
than about ease of use should be using

525
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,760
usenet

526
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
so the future we're going to keep on

527
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,480
spreading the word and we're going to

528
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,240
keep on being a normal and stable board

529
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,840
and now i'm going to talk some tell some

530
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,240
stories about usenet

531
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,280
uh usenet i without

532
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,440
really going into like a really long uh

533
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,400
seminar

534
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,200
or um writing a book it's hard just to

535
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,480
tell all of the really great stories

536
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,600
about youtube and some of them are

537
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,559
hilarious

538
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,440
some of them are really

539
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,960
thought-provoking and i hope i've got a

540
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,280
couple of those here

541
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,799
but it's good to see what happened here

542
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,640
and what kind of conversations can still

543
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,320
happen

544
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,679
so there's this grad student from

545
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,960
finland in 1991 he decided he wanted to

546
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,720
build his own operating system

547
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,400
he had been using this unix like

548
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,320
operating system called minix

549
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
but he decided but it was it was closed

550
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,520
source and he wanted to

551
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,720
have his own and he wrote

552
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
i'm doing a free operating system just a

553
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
hobby won't be big

554
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,520
or professional like gnu and if you've

555
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,039
anybody here has ever heard of gnu heard

556
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,880
you know that's kind of a joke

557
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,280
um for for a 386 and 486 clones

558
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
um i've currently ported bash and gcc

559
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,320
and things to work

560
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,720
and it seems and things seem to work

561
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,480
this implies that i'll get something

562
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,919
practical within a few months

563
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,840
i like to see what people want and if

564
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,919
there's any suggestions

565
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,200
this is linus torvalds by the way

566
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,840
within days response was linux is

567
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,559
obsolete

568
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,600
uh and this guy uh unfortunately

569
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
part of it was cut off here but he

570
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,799
responded you know that

571
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,200
you know he knows what he's doing and

572
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,039
that he knows a thing of true about what

573
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,400
our operating systems are going in the

574
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,159
next in the next few weeks or next few

575
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,440
years

576
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,559
famous last words um

577
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,039
linus being the person that he is was

578
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,320
never afraid of being politically

579
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,200
correct

580
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,799
he wrote an advertisement a couple

581
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,880
months later saying do you pine for the

582
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,760
days of menix 1.1 where men were men

583
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,080
and wrote their own device drivers are

584
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,679
you without a nice project are you just

585
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,200
dying to cut your teeth on an operating

586
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,960
system you can try to modify for your

587
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,840
own needs

588
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,440
are you finding it frustrating when

589
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,039

590
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,039

uh saying that that they had finally

599
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,080
joined usenet and they were saying hello

600
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,760

601
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,000

607
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,919
straight f you

608

611
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,600
authors

612
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,679
propaganda not too many of us will be

613
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,679
interested in reading your messages

614
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,000
this guy actually obviously bought it

615
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
wow is this for real

616
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,679
honest to god russia gee i never thought

617
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,440
i'd see it does that imply that eunuchs

618
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,480
is behind the iron curtain

619
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,799
another person i want to voice my

620
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,559
support for those who feel that this

621
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,760
april fool's joke

622
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,919
about the soviet union on the use net is

623
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,200
in bad form

624
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,679
particularly when it appears when it

625
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,840
appeared in what many of us come to rely

626
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,720
as the authoritative source for news

627
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,840
about the youth network

628
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,039
welcome from a isolated cia

629
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,720
cia outpost and finally this is this is

630
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,559
great does anybody

631
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,520
seriously doubt that trinenko who has no

632
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
expertise in foreign policy and probably

633
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,320
can't even speak

634
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,400
let alone write another language would

635
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,559
post something to the to the usenet

636
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,880
that joke was in good taste anyone who

637
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,840
feels this way

638
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,679
but feels this way about a joke should

639
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
ask him herself

640
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,120
why is the net so central to his whole

641
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,799
life and this is

642
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,159
what's really great about this is this

643
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,640
is 1984 this is before the internet

644
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,760
and people are already asking these

645
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,360
questions why are you so addicted to the

646
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
network

647
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
cypherpunks

648
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,480
so um this is a another article that was

649
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,840
published

650
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,960
in 1997. a copy of my paper untraceable

651
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,880
digital cash information markets and

652
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,240
blacknet

653
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,120
is now on this url this url is actually

654
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,960
still live

655
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,280
this is my precision paper for a panel

656

657
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,360
social implications of digital money at

continuing

661
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
this paper summarizes several of the

662
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,120
ideas i often focus on

663
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,640
a much longer version of this paper

664
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,799
slated to appear in the new version of

665
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,760

heard of timothy c may he died a couple

674
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,039
of years ago he was a big influence

675
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,640
on uh crypto anarchy and on

676
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,240
um uh cryptocurrency

677
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
as it is today and this is 97 this is

678
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,239
years before bitcoin

679
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,120
uh he wrote another post the point is

680
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,080
this

681
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,919
communities are islands which cause

682
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,440
their members to adapt their own

683
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,640
interests

684
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,039
adapt their own interest to the dominant

685
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,559
interest or to change their interest

686
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,000
through argumentation i love that quote

687
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
i think it's a great quote

688
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
and finally

689
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
the cypherpunks began as a mailing list

690
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,480
that was hosted on somebody's house

691
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,200
and then it crashed and the guy didn't

692
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,559
want to start it up again

693
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,440
so a new mailing list was started but at

694
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,039
the same time they started moving things

695
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,520
to usenet

696
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,799
so he writes so what can be meant by

697
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,320
saying that cypherpunk's

698
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,640
that the cyberpunk's list was an anarchy

699
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,480
what most of us meant surely

700
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,159
was that there was no leadership safer

701
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,400
leading through one's own words

702
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
no ruling board of directors no

703
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
elections no voting process

704
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,919
no top no top no arch anarchy

705
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,520
we're going to skip this one

706
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,120
but my notes are online um it's actually

707
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,559
kind of funny

708
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,639
um what's that

709
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,840
okay well this went a little faster than

710
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,200
i wanted to okay well if you want to see

711
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,600
it

712
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,159
so all.tasteless was 4chan before there

713
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,760
was a 4chan

714
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,360
this happened early 90s and

715
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,200
at the same time rec.pets with that cats

716
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,320
was a news group in our big eight

717
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,240
groups it was a professional um

718
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,480
or maybe not professional but it was a

719
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,360
um

720
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,720
a strict group on cats

721
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,960
and feeding and and grooming and

722
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,240
everything you know to do with cat

723
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,760
lovers

724
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,000
and so this this guy named who called

725
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,159
himself trashcan man on all.tasteless

726
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,799

women he was dating at the time

738
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,400

746
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,480

751
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120

752

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
is open for ventilation so a few seconds

766
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,679

767
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,919

768
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,039

please help it's either the cats or my

770
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,039
love life

771
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,960
and someone responded because these were

772
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,640
people who who really wanted to give

773
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,559
this guy the benefit of the doubt

774
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,799
but then they realized that he's a troll

775
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,760
and they wrote

776
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,600
a lot of people to understand how pets

777
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
owners feel about their pets

778
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,640
sometimes someone went around

779
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,000
suppose someone went around in a park

780
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,200
and putting up posters of your kid

781
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,240
getting mutilated

782
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,760
this is what this was like these are

783
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,000
these people's overreaction um to just

784
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,120
to this troll

785
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,440
and at the time nobody really knew how

786
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,559
to deal with trolls they didn't know

787
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,279
that the

788
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,120
way you deal with trolls is that you

789
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,799
don't feed the trolls

790
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,640
but they did and then this actually

791
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,559
became a thing for months and months

792
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,880
although tasteless versus wrecked up

793
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,080
pets.cats

794
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,440
months and months some other stories

795
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,640
um there was um

796
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,279
rec.arts.movies in 1990

797
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,279
uh this guy started posting his scripts

798
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,279
these were um

799
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,480
perl scripts that he had written and a

800
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,919
couple years later he decided to turn

801
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,200
that into a website

802
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,320
called imdb and i found the original

803
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,799
post that's

804
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,720
actually really cool also in 1990

805
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,919
like i said this is kind of the heyday

806
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,720
viewsnet this guy decided he's going to

807
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,840
write his own

808
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,880
crypto software based on public private

809
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,279
key

810
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,880
encryption this became pgp he was later

811
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,159
arrested for this because he was

812
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,000
considered to be

813
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,799
because he was using such um in-depth

814
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,440
encryption

815
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,720
the government considered this to be a

816
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,240
weapon that was exporting outside the

817
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
united states

818
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,679
um these are the kinds of things that

819
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,200
happen on youtube if you can go back to

820
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
the archives and see for yourself

821
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,760
but it's just a really great um

822
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,480
a great thing to read and this is the

823
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,760
kind of thing that i would like to see

824
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,960

825
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,520
of conversations happening again

826
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,320
only thing i ask from you is not money

827
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,200

different implementations for it

847
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,120
there are you can recommend there are

848
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,440
multiple implementations

849
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,559
inn is the most common it's uh

850
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,960
available in pretty much every internet

851
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,559
any linux distribution

852
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,840
just search for inn and the inn website

853
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,520
has a step-by-step guide on how to set

854
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,000
it up

855
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,760
you basically just need a server with an

856
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,200
ip and a host name

857
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,520
it's it's it's more difficult than a web

858
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,880
server but it doesn't require much more

859
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,960
than a web server

860
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,679
we have any more

861
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,919
i would like to share a

862
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,600
curious thing about using it

863
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,000
around 2001 um

864
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,320
psych which is a hacker from us

865
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,600
and i we developed the

866
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,440
original concept for liquid democracy

867
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,320
and which we then 2004 we presented at

868
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,240
the european social forum

869
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,960
and um

870
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,640
at 2004 yeah and um

871
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,880
in our original concept since there was

872
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,840
no blockchain

873
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,519
we choose to use the usenet as a kind of

874
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,000
censorship resistant database

875
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,039
for posting the the signed

876
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,200
signed messages with structured

877
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,640
content which would be then parsed

878
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,720
by notes independent notes

879
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,880
which would then for example if there

880
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,000
was a vote about

881
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,360
some issue um a check

882
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,000
if the people who posted the messages

883
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,720
were

884
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,120
on the list like authorized for the

885
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,640
votes to be counted

886
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,880
and also what to do in the independent

887
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,320
processing

888
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,080
um and so late

889
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,360
unfortunately our original startup or

890
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,880
project

891
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,000
didn't didn't work late it was adopted

892
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,600
by the pirate party and then um

893
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,640
implemented in a different way but i

894
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,679
wanted just to

895
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,080
to share this because the usenet was

896
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,279
crucial for it to work

897
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,240
before later on the blockchain was

898
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,840
invented

899
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,320
um the same organization that paul

900
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,480
rosenberg wrote his book on

901
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,080
sorry was this the same organization

902
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,000
that paul rosenberg wrote his book on

903
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,000
uh paul rosenberg he wrote a book called

904
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,440
the the greatest

905
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,240
uh crypto story never told and it was

906
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,519
something similar to that so

907
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:57,840
i didn't read that book
