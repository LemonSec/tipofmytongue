00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,440
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,440
let me start with my presentation about

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,880
trustless technologies versus

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,080
intermediaries

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,040
and i will give you an example of

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,320
legislation

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,440
i know it is a topic which is

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,080
uh something not everybody is very happy

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,880
about

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,880
um and i want to give you a little bit

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,920
of background why

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
i am so interested and actually ended up

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,279
becoming or

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,840
where i became a lawyer um because i

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,359
started actually as a

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,320
tech person or i was always interested

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,440
in tech i

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
i i even tried to to code a little bit

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,120
of software but i'm a horrible coder

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,760
so forgive me but what i have is a basic

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,360
understanding of tech and i'm always

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,520
fascinated by new technologies

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,360
um and then i i

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,079
actually decided to say okay like i

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,840
understood tech like the rules how it is

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,960
working and and

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,760
even how you actually can imp like

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,960
implement it or like

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
how you can actually uh use technology

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,438
and then i said i want to learn the

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,680
rules how our society works and

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,760
um this piece of legislation in

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,360
dechensen is actually regulating an area

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,640
of technology which started

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
on behalf of the idea like we don't need

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
any regulation and we don't need

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,759
intermediaries

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
because you saw what was happening until

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,600
2008

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
so um and now we ended up with having

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,439
regulation

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
but i will try to give you uh

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,799
our or at least the view i have on this

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
why on in certain areas

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
it still makes sense or it it makes

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
sense to have

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
regulation and intermediaries and in

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,280
other parts

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
it makes sense to use only technology

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,159
because technology does a better job

51
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,079
and this is what this presentation is

52
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,559
all about

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
so um you already heard a little bit

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,680
about my person

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,880
i want just to uh that you know what is

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
lichenstein i will keep it very very

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
short i will just tell you

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,080
that liechtenstein is in the heart of

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,680
europe we are between switzerland and

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,480
austria

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,040
um and we have a strong financial center

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,080
the only message

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
i want to give you there is actually

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,440
that liechtenstein

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
had no reason or no need for a specific

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,959
regulation in the blockchain area

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,800
to attract new businesses that that that

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,319
was not the starting point of it

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,200
the starting point was actually a work

70
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,840
group

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
built by the government of liechtenstein

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
2016

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
and i was i was a part of that work

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,800
group and

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,560
what i want to point out about in that

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
roadmap is that

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
this workgroup started to build up

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,879
knowledge before we thought about

79
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,720
crucial questions like do we need

80
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,920
regulation

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,599
um and i will not go into detail how the

82
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,000
the political process went and uh what

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,120
that took

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,680
us or the government actually to to have

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
that act in force

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,159
um what i want to to tell you there is

87
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,879
that we use

88
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,920
quite a lot of times uh in in really

89
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,599
focusing on understanding

90
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,040
this technology and um to understand

91
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
this technology

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,720
and to and and to answer the question if

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,280
we need

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
regulation and that was actually

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,640
different from other approaches i saw so

96
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,280
far

97
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,840
um uh in not not only in europe but

98
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,640
globally

99
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,760
uh because quite a lot of legislative

100
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,840
approaches they they said okay there's

101
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,680
new technology we have to stop that or

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,360
we have to regulate that or

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,760
uh because or we we will we will have

104
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
legislation to attract new business in

105
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,319
that area

106
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,720
um but the least in china and that's

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
what i call the leasing chain approach

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,319
was

109
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,920
actually to build up knowledge first to

110
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,519
understand what what's new

111
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,959
uh and then to answer the question is

112
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,640
regulation needed because uh

113
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,400
the the the prime minister asked

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
actually that work group

115
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,360
um shouldn't we just let it let it

116
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
just try to to to uh to have that in

117
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,840
liechtenstein

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
to allow it don't regulate it and see

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,959
what happens

120
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,439
um or if we have like the existing legal

121
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,599
framework is able to deal with that

122
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,640
um and i will try to to tell you why

123
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,120
it was actually in the end even in my

124
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
opinion a good idea to have

125
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,440
to have regulation in that area but

126
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,399
don't get me wrong

127
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,240
i'm of the opinion if technology alone

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,919
will provide solutions and you don't

129
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,759
need any intermediaries then don't use

130
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,000
any

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
intermediaries and because liechtenstein

132
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
is a part of the european economic area

133
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,440
we had to

134
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,919
think of if it is if it is even possible

135
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,800
for us

136
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,840
to have a specific legislation in

137
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,040
liechtenstein we answered that question

138
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,000
also with a strong yes but uh like uh

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,040
some some days ago

140
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,560
the european commission issued their um

141
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,639
me car proposal like a regulation for

142
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,199
marketing crypto assets

143
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,560
and um we all know how traditional bank

144
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
transactions

145
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,560
um work with intermediaries i think we

146
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,360
all know that

147
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
there are a lot of intermediaries

148
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
involved and why

149
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,919
these intermediaries are involved

150
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,639
because the parties they

151
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,800
they are not allowed to or that they are

152
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
not able to trust each other

153
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,199
and uh that's the concept of this

154
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
financial market transactions

155
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
is that you have intermediaries and

156
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
there's a specific regulation

157
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,440
uh that this that you should be able to

158
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,960
trust these intermediaries we all know

159
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,360
that

160
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,639
this works good and very bad uh

161
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
depending on uh the situation but in

162
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
general this works

163
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
uh and then uh we realized okay there's

164
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
this new technology

165
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,960
and um i will come to that point a

166
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
little bit later why i say

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
it's a new technology it's not

168
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,320
blockchain or dlt because uh what the

169
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,919
liechtenstein blockchain act

170
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,560
or this specific legislation actually

171
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,520
identified is that it's it's a new

172
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,479
technology

173
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,759
where um you you are able to interact

174
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,440
with each other without trust so it's a

175
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
trustless technologies that's why

176
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,199
uh the blockchain act has a specific

177
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,720
name it's not talking about blockchain

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
or dlt

179
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
so you will not find any blockchain or

180
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,240
dlt

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,360
in the legislation that's that's not a

182
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
term we use

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
to be as technologically neutral as

184
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,800
possible so

185
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,199
the idea was to say okay there's this

186
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,400
new technology

187
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,280
and um what we want to actually provide

188
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,880
is the legal framework

189
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,639
and actually i will come to that in a

190
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,400
minute later

191
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
that it actually supports uh this

192
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,680
technology

193
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,919
so we said okay we don't need uh to to

194
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,600
talk about blockchain or dlt it's it's

195
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,199
just a new technology

196
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,680
and uh so we even because in the

197
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,800
regulation

198
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,720
world like everybody was talking about

199
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
this classification approach that you

200
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,240
have securities and utilities and

201
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,479
and and whatsoever we didn't use that uh

202
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,919
term as well and there's no

203
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,520
classification within it

204
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,639
uh because uh we wanted to to to

205
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,800
let it like the idea was to have it as

206
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,039
flexible as somehow possible

207
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,039
so there's no classification approach as

208
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,560
well

209
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
what's in the center is trusted

210
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
technologies you can also call it

211
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,599
trustless technology

212
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,479
and and we all know that a trustless

213
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,800
technology actually allows you to

214
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
interact with another party without

215
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,479
without

216
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
trusting the other party and

217
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,319
that's actually i mean that sounds very

218
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,520
simple

219
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,560
but it is actually huge uh it is

220
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,880
even huge for the impact of of of the

221
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,319
legal frameworks

222
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
and um what is different or what is

223
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
special about the liechtenstein

224
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,199
blockchain act is actually that it's the

225
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,400
legal basis

226
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
for the token economy you see a lot of

227
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
people talking about

228
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,840
now every half a year a new buzzword is

229
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,479
coming

230
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,039
um the idea about the liechtenstein

231
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,840
blockchain

232
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,840
act is actually that digitalization

233
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,319
is anyway happening and the question is

234
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,360
which areas of law you have to address

235
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,599
to make it possible not to stop it not

236
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,400
to hinder it

237
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,360
but to foster innovation and to have

238
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
legally binding transactions

239
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,400
and i know some of you will think it

240
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,599
doesn't make any sense

241
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,759
because we don't need like the legal

242
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,520
part of it but i will try to

243
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,560
show you uh in which areas you still

244
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,280
need

245
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
regulation and you still need actually

246
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,039
to have legal certainty

247
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,199
i'm talking about this bridging function

248
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,479
i will come to

249
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,519
that in a minute um and what we

250
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,440
identified is actually which functions

251
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,479
tokens have

252
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,200
and um for these transactions i was well

253
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,958
we were talking about actually it's

254
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,958
the first is the legitimization part of

255
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,120
it um

256
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,680
like if you are the token holder you are

257
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,519
the person actually

258
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,320
who is uh the person who is allowed to

259
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
transact who is allowed to to

260
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
use this token and the rights

261
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
represented by the token

262
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,120
um and another very crucial function is

263
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
that if you use that within a system um

264
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,320
like an economy like a token economy

265
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,440
um the person if you claim something

266
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,279
if you claim one of your rights and the

267
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,560
other party actually

268
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,680
um you will use your token to to uh to

269
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,560
claim that

270
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,800
uh the other party if he pays once he

271
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,240
doesn't have to pay twice

272
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,760
um that's a very crucial function as

273
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,279
well and the third function

274
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,000
which is actually like the function

275
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,279
everybody was or

276
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,880
is thinking about when when he talks

277
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
about blockchain is the transportation

278
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,160
function you can easily actually

279
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,519
um sign transactions and uh like

280
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,160
move this tokens around without having

281
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,680
any intermediary in place

282
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,640
uh globally with only a little bit of of

283
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,839
of technology

284
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
and uh that's why it is so beautiful so

285
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,760
we said okay

286
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,120
um if we think about the token economy

287
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
and uh we think that uh you will have

288
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,839
not only um i mean currency is one use

289
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,240
case

290
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,680
so um did like how we actually pay for

291
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,640
things or

292
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,519
or how we store value is one use case uh

293
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,440
but if you think a little bit further

294
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,480
um and that's why this uh this

295
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,560
legislation is is actually crucial that

296
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
first of all this is going

297
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,200
to support the token economy and that's

298
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
the legal basis of the token economy

299
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,000
so you need a specific regulation for

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,120
the token economy

301
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,680
and what do i mean with token economy um

302
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,519
the concept is that you have a token

303
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,399
representing

304
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,240
a right may it be ownership maybe usage

305
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,839
right so whatever you write you can

306
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,560
think of

307
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,959
can be represented within a token this

308
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,000
actually allows

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,519
um tokenization of assets and

310
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,360
if you tokenize an asset you can easily

311
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
move it

312
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,680
very easily from from here to japan back

313
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,839
uh just with the use of technology

314
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,279
and because that part of of

315
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,040
of the technology works like a charm so

316
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,720
you don't need any intermediate there

317
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,079
and it doesn't make any sense

318
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,839
that you have intermediaries there if

319
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,519
the technology is able to provide these

320
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,560
solutions

321
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,440
but on the other hand there are parts

322
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,880
for example if you

323
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,959
tokenize the ownership right of a car of

324
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,560
a physical assets

325
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,800
you have to have a bridge between the

326
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,680
digital world

327
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,760
and the real world also known as the

328
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,279
digital twins

329
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,240
so we ended up with the token container

330
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,959
model

331
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,079
and uh what uh that's actually my idea

332
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,160
if you define a token and the functions

333
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,720
of a token um that's

334
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,560
what the token what the token is

335
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,760
actually able to do

336
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,839
um and that's actually crucial it

337
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,760
doesn't matter which technology you're

338
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,880
using or which

339
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
blockchain you're using or which dlt

340
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
technology you're using

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,839
um that doesn't matter it's just a piece

342
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,120
of information which is able to

343
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,399
represent something

344
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,079
and depending on the use case then you

345
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,839
have to define the functions so for

346
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,120
example

347
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
white listing or burning or whatsoever

348
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,959
but really depending on the function how

349
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,320
you're going to pla oh how are you

350
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,680
planning to use that token

351
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,959
so you have that token that's the

352
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,959
technological part of it and the legal

353
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,880
part of it so if you want to use these

354
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
new technologies to

355
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
tokenize things it's not possible to

356
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
have a physical object within a digital

357
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
twin but what you actually can do from a

358
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,000
legal perspective

359
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,800
is you will use the right one of the

360
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,399
right is for example that's the

361
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,079
the best right you can actually get is

362
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,920
ownership because that's the full right

363
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,279
you can do whatever you want with that

364
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,000
thing

365
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,920
is the ownership right or let's say use

366
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
it right so what you actually do is take

367
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,600
that usage right and let the token

368
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880
represent that

369
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,920
right and then what what uh what you

370
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,519
then do i mean then you have like the

371
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,480
flexibility of

372
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,959
every uh blockchain or dlt system you

373
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,959
can easily transfer it from a to b

374
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,360
depending on which rights you're

375
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,480
actually

376
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,800
which these tokens actually represent

377
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
you have

378
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,160
again the legal framework with some

379
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
mandatory laws you might have to follow

380
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,079
but this is actually case by case but

381
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,279
there are things where you

382
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,760
i mean for example bitcoin in in in the

383
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,680
literature and blockchain act

384
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,480
yeah if you uh transfer bitcoin from

385
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,680
person to person

386
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,040
that's not regulated um it uh so the

387
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
idea is really to regulate only where

388
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,000
you have to regulate

389
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,839
coming back to the token container model

390
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,519
so now you have like a token

391
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,040
representing a right

392
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,839
and then you have to answer specific

393
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,040
questions what will happen to the

394
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,000
physical object

395
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
and we have a solution for that i will

396
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
come to that in more detail

397
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,480
also a little bit later um but this

398
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
approach is very flexible from a legal

399
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,600
point of view because you can actually

400
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,440
use whatever right you have within your

401
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,560
existing framework

402
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,360
uh so let's say a utility a usage right

403
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
an access right

404
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,440
an ip whatsoever you can even have uh

405
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,160
like

406
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,240
your your your shares of a company

407
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,320
commodities ownership right so whatever

408
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,440
is is possible

409
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,839
what whatever right you can think of is

410
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,959
actually

411
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,880
you can actually let the token represent

412
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,000
that right

413
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
and that that's the that's the one part

414
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,920
of it the token and the concept of that

415
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
this token represents whatever right

416
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
yeah you you might you might use

417
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,839
and the other thing is that we have a

418
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
relay i refer to that as a relationship

419
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,360
model

420
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,240
we say okay there's something uh which

421
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,800
we call

422
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,440
tt keys so trusted technology keys uh

423
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,279
also known as private keys in

424
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,079
in most blockchains actually um and we

425
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,399
have an identifier

426
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
like the public key and um also

427
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,680
as technologically neutral as somehow

428
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
possible

429
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,680
and uh there you have a relation between

430
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,240
these two

431
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,440
from a legal point of view and so what

432
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
does that mean

433
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,040
now uh in general and that's what i try

434
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
to tell everybody it's just

435
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,760
it's just like a

436
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,279
very flexible way of digitalization and

437
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:41,760
it's a

438
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
like a way of how you can use the

439
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,000
technology and the blockchain act is

440
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,399
actually the legal framework

441
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,920
that you can make use of this technology

442
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,800
um you can also refer like i thought of

443
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,199
like

444
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,600
you can think of it as the sdk for legal

445
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,480
certainty

446
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,920
and what do i mean with that for example

447
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,000
if you transfer a token from a to b

448
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,959
you can have a 200 pages contract

449
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,839
dealing with all

450
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,480
of the consequences so the consequences

451
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,199
with that

452
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,040
or you use the lichtenstein blockchain

453
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,399
act which

454
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,440
actually solves specifically the civil

455
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,839
law

456
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,040
questions we have there so

457
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,920
yes you can you can use that technology

458
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,040
but where needed

459
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
uh you will you will this allows you

460
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,360
actually to use

461
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,759
the legal framework that you get legal

462
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,120
certainty because

463
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,160
um for example if you transfer

464
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,639
as i said the the example is the diamond

465
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,399
if you transfer the ownership token of

466
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,639
that diamond

467
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,560
you have to have a claim which is

468
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,160
enforceable

469
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,279
so you will have to have a way

470
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,600
because otherwise like the majority of

471
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,120
people will not use it

472
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,199
um i know that there are certain risks

473
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,240
involved with that and we

474
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,000
specifically talk about surveillance we

475
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,839
specifically talk about transparency and

476
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,560
that you don't have

477
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
any i mean if if you think about this

478
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,680
token economy and

479
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,040
and if everything is actually available

480
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,320
or on

481
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,600
on a center or a decentralized ledger um

482
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
you can you can think of a lot of

483
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,519
measurements we we don't want to have

484
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,880
from a privacy point of view

485
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,040
but there might be solutions there and

486
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,720
hopefully there will be solutions

487
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,839
developed in that direction but think of

488
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,079
it

489
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,680
as actually an sdk or a kit

490
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,920
to provide solutions where you have

491
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,360
legal certainty in the end

492
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,639
if you use blockchain technologies which

493
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,199
brings me to the point um

494
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,759
as i started you have a technology

495
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,759
trying to get rid of the intermediaries

496
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,440
and now you have a piece of legislation

497
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,079
which

498
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,560
claims to be the one who understood that

499
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,120
technology and came from

500
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,279
uh from a perspective where we said okay

501
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,880
let's try to understand what is good

502
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,560
about that and to foster innovation in

503
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,680
that area

504
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,759
and uh if we analyze the blockchain hack

505
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,440
we ended up with having actually some

506
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
new intermediaries

507
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,759
um so i will talk a little bit about

508
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,480
intermediary trust versus trustless

509
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,079
trustless systems how you actually can

510
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,400
have

511
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,959
trust one is trust can be derived from

512
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
technology trustless systems or

513
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,559
from regulated intermediaries you can

514
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,079
think of both

515
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,640
systems the way you want if the one is

516
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,240
perfect or the other is perfect i think

517
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,039
for both

518
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,240
versions you have good and bad um

519
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,880
or even i can think of of good and bad

520
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,480
um

521
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,320
let me come back to the ques like to the

522
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,080
example i had in the beginning with with

523
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,679
the trustworth technologies

524
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,000
so for that transaction between two

525
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,520
parties i mean you don't need an

526
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,400
intermediary

527
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,320
we have blockchain technology which

528
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,919
actually makes it perfectly well

529
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,919
you have no counterparty risk that's

530
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,280
that's that's actually

531
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,400
the beauty like one of the like i think

532
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,240
most of the people are the persons

533
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,600
understood that

534
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,360
the blockchain technology is able to

535
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,080
provide that without any intermediary

536
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,679
you don't need any bank nothing

537
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,400
that's fine that works like a charm okay

538
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,720
but

539
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,360
do we need regulated intermediaries

540
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,480
somewhere else

541
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,400
and the literature and blockchain act

542
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,160
said okay if you for example

543
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
store your own private keys if you if

544
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,360
you are able and you you you want

545
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,039
to do everything yourself then that's

546
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,440
fine but if you ask a professional

547
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
service provider and a professional

548
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,880
service provider takes your money to

549
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,720
actually provide services for you like

550
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,000
custody then yes you have the same

551
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,960
problem again

552
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,799
he will provide services for third party

553
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,080
that's an intermediary

554
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,760
and if there is an intermediary

555
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
providing these services

556
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
then you have to think about regulation

557
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,440
because why would you trust

558
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,600
such a person if you don't know him very

559
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,960
well

560
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,160
and regulation can provide trust

561
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,520
in that area the second part is um

562
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,840
the bridging of the digital and the real

563
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,919
world as i said

564
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,039
the digital twin so the token um

565
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,440
if it represents ownership of whatever

566
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,559
the problem is

567
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,000
um if you transfer the digital twin you

568
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,799
have to have

569
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,799
legal certainty that the right

570
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,799
represented within that token

571
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,160
is also transferred and

572
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,880
in most cases or in a lot of cases this

573
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,320
is possible without having any

574
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,120
intermediary

575
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,240
specifically for example in

576
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,400
liechtenstein with company shares that's

577
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
possible without

578
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,160
intermediaries um we can think of the

579
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,840
secondary market that's a specific

580
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,120
question but to issue tokens

581
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,840
on your own behalf you don't need any

582
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,160
intermediaries

583
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,200
there are actually legislation or draft

584
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,440
legislations or or

585
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,160
provisional registrations where this is

586
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,760
treated differently that even for the

587
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,960
emission you need

588
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,120
you need an intermediary but i don't

589
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,160
think that you need

590
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,120
it that respect but if you have physical

591
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,080
objects

592
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,440
um depending on the use case you might

593
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,400
need a person which actually uh built

594
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
the bridge between the real world and

595
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,280
the digital world

596
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,960
and third point i want to mention here

597
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,280
is abuse prevention and i'm not talking

598
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,200
but also talking about anti-money

599
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
laundering and cft

600
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
but also talking about order books and

601
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
the problem is coming back to the

602
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,960
question

603
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,559
you have to understand the technology

604
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,799
first as a lawyer you have to understand

605
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,159
the technology first as

606
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,760
a regulator you have to understand the

607
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,400
technology first i think

608
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,159
and for example if you look at order

609
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,640
books and the way of how exchanges and

610
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
cryptocurrency exchanges operate

611
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,960
i mean these are central institutions i

612
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,039
mean they have a central order book

613
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,280
it's basically a website nothing else

614
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,039
but they can actually do whatever they

615
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,240
want with that data

616
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,640
they can they can do fake orders front

617
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,520
running everything inside the trading

618
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
and there are decentralized ways of

619
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,200
doing that where

620
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,440
all of these issues are addressed but

621
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,120
you see that the majority they are

622
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,400
acting differently and

623
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,240
i mean who really understands if

624
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,840
somebody is claiming like we are the

625
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,640
next

626
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,039
uh cryptocurrency exchange and we are

627
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:05,840
secure

628
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,760
because we are decentralized and then

629
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,280
what is really decentralized is only

630
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,640
clearing and settlement but the other

631
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,000
book is not decentralized

632
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,520
and then you have all of these problems

633
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,200
again so yes

634
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,159
even there you might you might need new

635
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,840
intermediaries

636
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,679
or you might need regulation not new

637
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,520
intermediaries i mean these are anyway

638
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,440
already regulated um

639
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,000
and as i said for example like now we

640
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,880
say

641
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,440
we have let's call her lisa lisa says

642
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,400
okay i want to

643
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,720
use this technology but i don't want to

644
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,559
manage my keys because i just don't have

645
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,480
the knowledge i mean i

646
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,039
there are a lot of persons who just

647
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,000
don't have the knowledge

648
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,280
to use these technologies and so they

649
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,120
ask third parties to help them

650
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,720
and the problem is if you ask a third

651
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
party to help them you

652
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,440
you have the same problem again who

653
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,080
actually

654
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,520
you have to trust them and um

655
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,240
in a lot of cases i mean it's possible

656
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,120
to trust them

657
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,240
but you always have people who have like

658
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,440
who are not trustworthy actually because

659
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,840
they don't provide their services well

660
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,200
and you can say okay

661
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,640
that's easy because the market will

662
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,880
solve the problem nobody will go to them

663
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,440
and that's one part but the other thing

664
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,000
is like

665
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,240
for the person losing then their their

666
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,280
money or whatever they have

667
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
represented by the token actually that's

668
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,640
too late um

669
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,559
so if you ask a service provider who

670
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,080
will actually

671
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,880
use that technology for you because he

672
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,760
is able to

673
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,840
to manage your private keys for example

674
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,520
i mean

675
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,840
i i mean if you can manage your your

676
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
private keys yourself you know but there

677
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,799
are really a lot of people who don't

678
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,679
want to do that

679
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,280
so you have service providers again and

680
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
there you need trust again

681
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,799
and um therefore uh i mean for now

682
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,760
there's

683
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,600
actually i cannot think of a better

684
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,240
solution than than having a regulated

685
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,919
person if you do that

686
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,159
in a professional way and you ask for

687
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,360
fees for that

688
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,559
then that's that's one solution

689
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,919
and uh one specific uh

690
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,120
intermediary uh which uh actually the

691
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,559
lincolnshire and blockchain act

692
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,600
uh introduced is the physical validator

693
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,120
and i used a picture of that bridge

694
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,799
between the real world and did

695
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,280
the digital world coming back to my um

696
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,720
to my example with

697
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,679
the the physical object the ownership of

698
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,960
the of the diamond

699
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
if i actually issue a token representing

700
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,880
an ownership of a diamond and then i

701
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,200
will i will transfer that token to to

702
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,320
another party

703
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,440
um and i lose my for example and then he

704
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,480
will transfer it

705
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,240
again and again and again and actually

706
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,919
the final token holder will come to me

707
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,760
and say thomas please i am the owner

708
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,480
of that diamond please hand it over and

709
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,240
i lost it or

710
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,080
actually yesterday it was stolen you

711
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
know in the end

712
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,279
it is not enforceable anymore and

713
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,200
this will actually hinder adoption in

714
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,320
that area

715
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,400
so we thought of having an intermediary

716
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
when you have certain

717
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,120
where you have certain tokens

718
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,279
representing ownership rights of

719
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,400
physical things

720
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,039
where you have a physical validator

721
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,200
providing trust within that transaction

722
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,679
because again and you can tell me

723
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,240
otherwise

724
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,919
if you have a technical solution how you

725
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,240
do that fine then let's discuss

726
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,279
you know but um if you if you want to do

727
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:25,679
it

728
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,799
now and uh the only way actually in the

729
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,480
end you know

730
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,400
how you can do that now or at least the

731
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,159
lichen chain government had no other

732
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,760
idea of doing it that way and i don't

733
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,240
think

734
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,400
and i think it is a clever way it's uh

735
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
it's it's actually the best

736
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,279
uh way i ever heard of uh for for now

737
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,520
and um what does that mean or what does

738
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,320
that actually

739
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,640
help so why don't you use only

740
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,159
technology i mean

741
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,000
it's fine if you have a token and you

742
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,760
can actually transfer it freely from

743
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,440
from a to b without having any

744
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,559
intermediary

745
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,679
um but only

746
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,600
contract or even if if if

747
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,279
whatever you want to do you have to

748
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,039
think about enforceability

749
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,080
uh so you and the lichenstein blockchain

750
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,600
act is actually the legal framework so

751
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,559
that's actually

752
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
the bridge between what is happening in

753
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,159
the digital world

754
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,720
and uh what is happening in the real

755
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,520
world

756
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,320
so you have to have like something which

757
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,840
actually combined these two

758
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
we call it coordination of these two

759
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,880
worlds

760
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,080
and with that you're not only you don't

761
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,000
not only have like the digital world you

762
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,200
also have the real world

763
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,159
enforceability um and that's actually

764
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,200
the big thing about the leaking

765
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,159
blockchain act if you want to put that

766
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,039
on one slide

767
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,679
um it has a definition of a token which

768
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,240
is

769
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,360
um i think i mean that's the first

770
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,720
one i saw uh in a legislation actually

771
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,799
and it's very flexible it's a piece of

772
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,080
information on

773
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,919
a tt system an aka blockchain dlt system

774
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,360
and uh which can represent whatever

775
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,840
right

776
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,360
but it doesn't have to represent so for

777
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,440
example deletion blockchainx says

778
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,640
that um bitcoin for example

779
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,159
and bitcoin that's also something very

780
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:14,640
special

781
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
the liechtenstein government was aware

782
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,919
of the difference between coin and token

783
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,600
whatsoever but from a legal point of

784
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,080
view

785
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,559
it was uh it was useful and necessary to

786
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,120
define the token and even the bitcoin

787
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,080
one bitcoin is

788
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,720
a token so but bitcoin is not

789
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,320
representing any right i mean the only

790
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,679
thing you can do is you actually can

791
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,440
sign transactions but that's fine and

792
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,720
that's not regulated

793
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,080
i mean if you don't provide services for

794
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,200
bitcoin for example and as

795
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,880
that's what i already talked about you

796
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,320
have the token functions you have that

797
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,159
relationship model

798
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,080
and then as i said if you dispose over a

799
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,880
token

800
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,960
you also transfer the right represented

801
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,000
by the token

802
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
and this will allow you to tokenize

803
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,120
assets

804
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,480
and it's very very flexible so we can

805
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
talk about whatever assets

806
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,799
or whatever right you have you can

807
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,480
actually tokenize that

808
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,120
and the concept is representation of

809
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,400
rights

810
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,240
rather than something else and you have

811
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,919
service providers where service

812
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,320
providers are needed

813
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,840
this will lead to legal certainty

814
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,279
i have uh some minutes left and then we

815
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:23,679
have

816
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,080
some questions the question is if

817
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,520
everything is digital

818
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
uh do we end up in digital totally

819
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,120
aneurysm and that's actually

820
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,640
one thing um i think of

821
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,480
yes i mean you have as i said uh

822
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,640
you have abuse prevention which is

823
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,320
necessary on the one hand

824
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,919
but on the other hand uh you have the

825
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,840
risk of financial surveillance

826
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,600
and i mean we all know that that's not a

827
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,279
risk that is

828
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,960
what is happening and um the question is

829
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
and i think you know there there should

830
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
be a balanced approach between these two

831
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
and um that's one of the biggest risks i

832
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
actually think for privacy because

833
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,919
to be to i mean i don't want i mean

834
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,440
i think that it's legit to have privacy

835
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,159
not everybody has to know what i have

836
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,200
what i'm doing

837
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,279
but on the other hand i think yes for

838
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,799
sure there are reasons

839
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,240
um where uh where you have to prevent

840
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,799
abuse of these technologies but the good

841
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,600
thing is and

842
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,200
i mean that's actually something

843
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,600
i think we should talk about is that we

844
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
need a balanced approach and i think

845
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,960
with that technology

846
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,240
it is possible to to address abuse

847
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,520
prevention

848
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
but on the other hand keep the privacy

849
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,679
of the users and i think we should end

850
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,840
up there because

851
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,760
without any aml

852
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
abuse preventions in cft we don't see

853
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,279
mass adoptions because

854
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,600
i know everybody thinks of yes it's easy

855
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,840
to to to hold your own private keys and

856
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
i don't need anybody

857
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,240
to to help me yes that's that's maybe

858
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,840
you and all of your friends

859
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,360
but uh if you look um and talk to to

860
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,679
whatever to your family to to your

861
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,720
grandma i mean

862
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,240
maybe your grandpa knows better than you

863
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,720
but my grandma doesn't know

864
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,799
anything about bitcoin or about private

865
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,840
keys so

866
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,240
if if you think about what's the beauty

867
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,279
of it and

868
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,000
what what what will this uh actually

869
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
transformation to a digital world

870
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,520
will allow us um i think it's good

871
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,240
and it's it's useful to think about how

872
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,120
we can even

873
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,640
how we can uh keep our privacy

874
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,480
uh within that token economy

875
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,679
and so i will conclude with three points

876
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,919
deletion from blockchain act there's

877
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,440
regulation only there

878
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,799
necessary it allows you actually to

879
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,159
bridge the digital

880
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,960
uh with the real world and think of the

881
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,440
tvdg as the stk

882
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,360
to get legal certainty so you can

883
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,640
provide the technology

884
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,440
and that's like somehow of an api to

885
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
have legal certainty in the real world

886
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,120
as well and what i don't i want

887
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,039
i don't want to discuss that for now

888
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,600
because my 30 minutes are over

889
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,399
but there's a proposed regulation from

890
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,679
the european commission

891
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,320
for the european union and it's

892
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,360
marketing crypto

893
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,960
assets regulation and i actually will

894
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,080
share my slides i think

895
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,080
so you have links there with a lot of

896
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,120
information

897
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,520
and that something anywhere will happen

898
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,039
in the european union so you

899
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,039
see more and more regulation in that

900
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,919
area coming

901
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,840
thank you very much

902
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,070

903
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:48,829
