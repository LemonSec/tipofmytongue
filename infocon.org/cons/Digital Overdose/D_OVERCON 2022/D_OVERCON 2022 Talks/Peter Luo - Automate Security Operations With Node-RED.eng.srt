00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,439
i'm the co-founder of deton me and

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,359
i used to be to be the

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,359
lead security analysis for microsoft

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,519
offices five where we predicted hundreds

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,800
of thousands of

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,960
exchange servers sharepoint servers and

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
onedrive servers

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,800
uh i got my phd in computer science um

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
so today i'm going to talk about the

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,520
security automation which is loaded raid

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,239
uh if you don't know the red and you can

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,840
quickly google search it

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,399
it's a very popular uh no code

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,239
automation platforms and we are

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,120
basically embossed

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,559
[Music]

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,160
so here's a

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,600
here's a rough agenda um

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
so i'll talk about a couple of use cases

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,440
that we

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,240
we had in manchester operation centers

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,600
and work with

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,840
different teams on managers of secure

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,159
operation centers

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,840
and uh later i'll talk about the high

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
level overview of node raid and i will

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,159
i'd love to give a demo i will i will

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,840
provide a couple of demos interactive

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,040
demos to show how how it works and uh

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
and then we can deep dive a little bit

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,520
into little red it has been

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,439
lots of features but i will i'll try to

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,720
provide a comprehensive these features

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,479
that we think i

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
that will get you get started with with

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,798
notary

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,000
um feel free to ask any questions if

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,799
there's any channel um i look i look

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,600
forward to interact with everyone in the

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,720
uh

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,079
in the room

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,920
um

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,520
so um

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,759
so i'm i'm a determining guy i'm so uh

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,719
so i i'm i'm more focused on how to how

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,079
do you run defense how to run data

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,680
operations of course there are lots of

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
things we can do on the rating side uh

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,079
but here i think the uh these are the

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,239
tasks like we are seeing very common in

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,560
the uh in the blue team

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,360
um

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,760
so for example like uh we have been uh

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,520
looking at like how to monitor the dark

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,640
web right if you if you uh

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,080
if you come across best ping you can

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,480
cross ad hoc uir you will always want to

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,360
look for you look for to monitor those

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,520
kind of

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
data exchange uh in those kind of

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
website and see if there's kind of

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,319
things relevant to your companies

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,800
um uh i've been doing this kind of

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,160
insulin response every time i have

73
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,840
insulin response i always want to enrich

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,519
our enrich the informations right like

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,440
the original ibs which

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
um you racially threaten intelligence i

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,040
always want to

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,640
learn lots of tedious works right like

79
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,440
if there's a email phishing email my

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,519
analyzing i always want to

81
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,840
parse those kind of emails if there's

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,599
any kind of communications i always need

83
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,440
to write emails to address different

84
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,239
things different dlps different

85
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,200
different phishing scenarios um so

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,040
there's i mean the uh

87
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
we are used to working microsoft and the

88
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
way like we deal with otherwise we have

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,879
to write down all those kind of steps in

90
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,599
the in one note we love one note by the

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,519
way uh we have to write all those kind

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,760
of steps and we have to do all this and

93
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,560
those kind of things manually um

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,159
and um

95
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,920
uh compliance and audience is always

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
well

97
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,519
takes time consuming it's always like a

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,519
takes lots of our efforts to

99
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,120
differentiate them

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,799
so especially in this kind of cloud a

101
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,440
year there's uh when you have users when

102
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,959
you manage like thousands of hundred

103
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,799
thousand users you want to

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,959
uh autism you want to make sure every

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,440
every user has the right password policy

106
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,360
you want to make sure every user have

107
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,239
the part uh have the right mfa enabled

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,560
you want to make sure the password

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,799
was

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,959
designed to rule out every three months

111
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,080
or those kind of things there are lots

112
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,920
of policies you want to make sure they

113
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,640
they they are they are strongly enforced

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,120
um and you and i don't want you to learn

115
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,000
manila

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
i i i

117
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,159
i i it's it's going it's it's probably

118
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,200
impossible to deliver newly um

119
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,640
let's talk about the security controls

120
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
let's talk about like a dlp

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,079
verifications let's talk about this kind

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,238
of email phishing uh training

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,639
simulations right and so

124
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,479
um you want to make sure those kind of

125
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,560
the ap are always uncontrolled you

126
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,199
always want to make sure whenever

127
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,600
there's a phishing and your system was

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
able uh

129
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
your system will design to catch it you

130
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,800
should be able to catch it and you

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
should always make sure that your secure

132
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
system is secured as you expected um you

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
know administration so we have been as

134
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,120
as as a stock team like we have you

135
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
manage different software's like even

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,919
like a small companies you have uh for

137
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,160
example you have a uh

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,560
we like you have new users

139
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
it's very new employees right you have a

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,919
you need to assign them to different

141
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,240
systems right uh different software

142
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
different tools for example your team

143
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,039
using the sims you are two teams you're

144
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,720
using like microsoft offices five

145
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,600
defenders if that team is using like uh

146
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,479
uh

147
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,600
using um uh using like uh maybe like

148
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
virus totals you need to assign those

149
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,680
kind of people uh into those kind of uh

150
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,720
uh

151
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,520
system granular permissions right and

152
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
you play limitless teams you always want

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
to make sure they they got off uh

154
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,039
completely from your systems they got to

155
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,160
cut out from systems completely so as a

156
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,240
as i was managing team i always feel

157
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,080
like dd is like i have to

158
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
manually add everyone i mean i have i

159
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
have a checklist i have to go through uh

160
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,800
this is a google data this is a google

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,280
this is the g suite uh this is like uh

162
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,600
uh this is like a developer tools like

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
bit bucket or something i go through

164
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,919
every tools and add them one by one uh

165
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,639
so this is not my main job to as

166
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,759
a blue team

167
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
my main focus should be focused on the

168
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
the different people rather than like

169
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,000
managing those kind of data tasks about

170
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
reporting right reporting uh

171
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,479
i mean security is a lot of aspects of

172
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,880
the building that's super important um

173
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,360
um better one one very important thing

174
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,280
maybe not a relevant to uh how you

175
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,759
defended people but this is a relevant

176
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,520
to how you uh getting your funding

177
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,120
getting getting you guys funded from

178
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
your upper management how to get

179
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
uh get a visibility across your

180
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,400
organizations how to get availability

181
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,840
across the

182
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,600
world across community right the

183
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,000
reporting so as we have mentioned using

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,400
different tools edr tools in er tools

185
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,880
you are using vulnerabilities and

186
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,400
lots of details in the security

187
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,240
university teams and that as i know like

188
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
elixir teams and every security people

189
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
security analysis has to deal with lots

190
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,639
of things but uh

191
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,319
no matter how complicated like why we

192
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,639
need to be able to like uh create a nice

193
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
report using like popular power bi tools

194
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,319
uh popular like data data uh data and

195
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,479
that analysis tools like power bi like

196
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,639
do their studio or whatever uh to

197
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,160
showcase to uh to all others to sell

198
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
what you have been doing you can

199
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
communicate the values that you have

200
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
been uh working on to them i mean those

201
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,599
kind of things it takes time uh it's not

202
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,599
it's taking this takes away time like

203
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,720
for us to focus on how to uh better

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,639
detect how to better respond to those

205
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,680
kind of

206
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,639
issues

207
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,360
and

208
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
what if we can ultimately i mean not a

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
lot unless you automate everything but

210
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,840
what if we can quickly ultimately

211
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,160
as much as possible so that we can focus

212
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,240
on the most important things i mean

213
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,840
automation is a

214
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,680
important task and then one thing when

215
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,199
we talk about automation i mean probably

216
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,720
everyone can talk about like

217
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,520
uh using like a uh writing writing code

218
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,280
right writing python script codes or

219
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,039
those kind of things i think i think

220
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,560
it's doable i mean like using bachelor

221
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
scripts or using a powershell scripts

222
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,280
using uh uh using whatever scripts uh

223
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,720
you know python script or whatever you

224
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
you like it right i mean it's doable i

225
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,479
think i think the chinese there is that

226
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,360
uh

227
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,039
there's uh um

228
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,400
let's definitely time consuming and

229
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,759
they're definitely lots of these lots of

230
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,919
things it's time for me there definitely

231
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
is a lot of uh there's a little bit more

232
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,520
skills right you have to learn how to do

233
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,759
programming uh

234
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,080
and write programming is not as

235
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,639
it's not a it's a fun stuff but it's not

236
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,400
like the most the easiest job for

237
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,479
everyone to do um there are different

238
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,479
challenges to get things right right um

239
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,280
um

240
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,840
uh uh plus like unless you if you write

241
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,599
code you have to you have to maintain it

242
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,960
right you have to make sure it's always

243
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,080
right side runs correctly um so there's

244
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,759
a lot of challenges like doing this

245
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,559
writing uh scripts uh uh but i think as

246
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
as um as a from the education point of

247
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,880
view i do encourage everyone to uh to

248
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,200
write or to write to learn how to write

249
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,958
programming uh

250
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,240
but now we have

251
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,399
we possibly have a better tools like uh

252
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,279
like enable you to write less code not

253
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,279
like a it is a little bit ambitious to

254
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,640
say no code but

255
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,920
but we will

256
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,760
with the help of the community with the

257
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,000
help of the uh um

258
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,519
of the technology probably you can write

259
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,920
this code i mean this is a this we find

260
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,480
already which is open source uh

261
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,080
uh uh open source automation tools uh so

262
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,399
no real was meant for like uh

263
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,800
iot iot automation i mean it has been

264
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
there for like over 10 years over 10

265
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,880
years it has a lot large pop large

266
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,360
community it's already have 33 more than

267
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,680
3 thousand integrations and people are

268
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
actively contributing to you due to this

269
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,200
kind of tools

270
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,480
um

271
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,399
from what we see is that so it's brought

272
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,160
the best editing you have flow editing

273
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,839
you have the you can get the flow you

274
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,720
can

275
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,959
i'll show you guys in demo in a couple

276
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,640
of minutes very

277
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,399
engine on high level you have a browser

278
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
level um

279
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,600
flow editing and it's built on node.js

280
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,680
based on their popular even loop

281
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,959
architecture

282
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,120
so and it's easily shareable with with

283
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,480
between different teams between

284
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,399
different

285
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,880
uh and contributed by community so you

286
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
can you can leverage whatever uh it's

287
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
already there

288
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
um

289
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,160
so

290
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,040
um

291
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,440
this is a little high level overview of

292
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
the of the of the way that you have all

293
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,560
these kind of

294
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,040
uh integrations on the left side and

295
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,800
that you have uh you have a you have

296
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
your

297
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,320
your lovely canvas where you can create

298
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
your automations and you can have a you

299
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,800
can create your automations from here

300
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
and you have you can have a detailed

301
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,560
instructions like what's input what's

302
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
output and how to use these kind of

303
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
integrations and you have you have menu

304
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,279
you can manually kind of work those

305
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,399
um okay speaking with that i think i'll

306
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,959
just quickly uh quickly get you a demo

307
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,079
uh uh to just to should let you guys

308
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,279
know

309
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,680
what i'm talking about here

310
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,720
um

311
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
can you see my

312
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,959
see my

313
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,200
browser

314
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
yeah okay great so this is a quick

315
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,279
example so let's say like we i want to

316
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,040
do some

317
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
uh

318
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
so on the left side there's a bunch of

319
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
functional integrations with different

320
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,800
subsequent tools us

321
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,959
let's say

322
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,839
let's say aws let's say arju claustra

323
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,040
crosstrack

324
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,240
uh

325
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,800
hybrid analysis uh jira those kind of

326
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,680
things

327
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,720
so

328
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
what i'm showing here is uh is this

329
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
canvas uh so what i'm doing here is that

330
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
i basically uh showing you i i include

331
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,720
an ip ip is called is a google defaulter

332
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,760
d4ip 8.8.8.8

333
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,399
and i want to go through a a note that

334
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,240
we call like ipg

335
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,399
uh fpga uh

336
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,000
information like at least one is

337
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
basically a parcel

338
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,560
parser ip uh and extract elective

339
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,959
information and then

340
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,000
i'm going to show you how to uh when i

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,760
run this one you will see the geo

342
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,680
information get outputted

343
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,240
uh on the right side so you can see

344
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
i uh basically at least take the input

345
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,560
of the 8.81 and then go through the go

346
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,200
through the the building integrations

347
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,959
and give you the information about this

348
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,360
ip versus what's the geo information of

349
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,480
this one

350
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,360
um

351
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,279
so this is a

352
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,600
a quick example of the geo i mean

353
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
there's lots of things we can do with

354
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
eyepiece for example especially in your

355
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,200
investigations right like you go to 3g

356
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,800
you go to survivor total you go to

357
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,720
through hyper analysis you go through

358
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
maybe essence you go through

359
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,560
um

360
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,040
abuse abuse ipdb right i mean lots of

361
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
things i can kind of quickly get like a

362
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
setup let's say let's just say let's put

363
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,480
your verse photo

364
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,600
and uh

365
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
and let's say

366
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
this one and

367
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,720
then uh

368
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
and uh for versus though you want to get

369
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
a versatile uh key right and you can get

370
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,920
a free premium uh version of keys

371
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
and keep yourself and then you can run

372
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,839
it and it will automatically create a

373
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,040
rush total

374
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,120
give you information about this these

375
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,839
ips has been detected

376
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,519
and who what are the engines are you

377
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,839
detected and who is the owners what's

378
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,920
the resolutions uh

379
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
so and so forth

380
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,560
all the hosts like result to this ips

381
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,079
let's say let's say i want to go to

382
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,200
abuse ipdb and i can go to abuse ivdb

383
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,839
and then i can

384
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,279
go to this one

385
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,839
so you see like it's give you errors

386
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,079
like api keys is not existed so i need

387
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,320
to make sure i have api

388
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,560
key here

389
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,120
uh so you can just go through uh abuse

390
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,440
ibdb and it's give you all the

391
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,839
information from uh builds ipdb give you

392
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,399
the hostname uh yeah there's definitely

393
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,920
some overlap with uh with other

394
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,279
information on authorizing invasions

395
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,519
let's say if you want to using a

396
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,360
crosstrack

397
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,199
thread thread crop you want to put your

398
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,040
three crowd and you can check the story

399
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,079
clock here

400
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,360
and you can do this one i think this one

401
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,680
is one

402
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,079
and if we write

403
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:12,959
uh

404
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,040
you can see you can see this crosstrack

405
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,639
at least a stray crowd they give you

406
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,160
information whether it's deny or

407
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,680
malicious

408
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,720
um

409
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,199
yeah so let's uh just give you a

410
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,439
first impression about the movement

411
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,560
so

412
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199
let's get a little bit deeper into the

413
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,839
lure stuff yeah so so movement has uh i

414
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,920
think you have seen a similar notes

415
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,399
right uh the the notes here uh some

416
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,800
nodes have like uh uh

417
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,120
we call like four types input nodes up

418
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
nodes utility function node and

419
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,480
third-party action node

420
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
so the input node has uh essentially

421
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,959
there are two two types of input so one

422
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,120
is once we call like uh

423
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,560
injector node one is the http endpoints

424
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,360
and

425
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,040
this inject knowledge enable you to run

426
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,199
like things periodically or enable you

427
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,639
to run uh or run adhoc and http is http

428
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,040
endpoints so you can uh you can quickly

429
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,279
create a rest api endpoints that can

430
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,880
connect to any kind of platforms you

431
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,519
have and then after they have the debug

432
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,880
or http response correspondingly so

433
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,920
uh

434
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,720
so

435
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,560
so for example this one is this one is

436
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,399
the inject this one is inject nervous

437
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,800
so this one is the inject node injects

438
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,880
best trigger you can see this one the

439
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
trigger has uh uh you can specify in you

440
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,240
can input different things input like a

441
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,120
timestamp or uh or content and you can

442
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,279
repeat you can repeat them at uh extreme

443
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,360
interval so you can specify like it runs

444
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,279
everywhere once a day or or runs uh uh

445
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,279
or at this time like

446
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,639
tuesday monday tuesday hour and uh at

447
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,160
different different different um

448
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,519
fine

449
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,360
and then you can use like a http uh

450
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
http endpoints so this http endpoints

451
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,079
get you you have you can see all kinds

452
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,560
of methods uh get poster put a deleted

453
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,880
patch you can quickly set up this one

454
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,079
you can give a url something some uir

455
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,519
and uh they have a

456
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,600
and uh and as a as the output you can

457
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,759
correspond is set up after you can go

458
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,759
you can do all kinds of things uh in

459
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,320
between and at the end you can set up a

460
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,560
response like is that the 200 is that

461
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
400 and based on your

462
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,480
uh your

463
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,720
your

464
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,519
requirements so this is the input and

465
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,440
output so two ways one is proactive one

466
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,279
is possible for proactive ways uh you

467
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,519
can you can schedule them you can and

468
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,160
for passwords you can uh you can build

469
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,720
up quickly quicker speed up uh api

470
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,600
endpoints and for any kind of systems uh

471
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,959
to connect with you for example you have

472
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,720
a servicenow team i know and lots of

473
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,680
companies have a uh servicenow team uh

474
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,440
if you if you want to

475
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
connect to the to the new raid i think

476
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,799
that's just super easy

477
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,679
um

478
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
so a little bit deep like uh down

479
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
here is uh how it works in within the

480
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,760
red so essentially anything anything uh

481
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,839
any node that basically is taking input

482
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,199
and output

483
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,480
adjacent format

484
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,400
in the the json format

485
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,880
the json values is getting passed

486
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,640
between different nodes

487
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,679
uh so whenever the winner operand

488
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,640
is basically json

489
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,880
just some type of uh

490
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
content and use with the default value

491
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,240
like payload

492
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,160
default value

493
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,960
default values payload msc dot payload

494
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,640
so that's the that's the main like

495
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
information carrier but you have other

496
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,600
attributes that you can you can specify

497
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
um

498
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,960
so and the fold

499
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,320
it has so

500
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,400
when you when you write automation you i

501
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,480
mean you probably have to write a lot of

502
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,760
other functions you want to like

503
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,440
flexibility in terms of pilot functions

504
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,760
you can just like javascript only so uh

505
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,919
if the nodes if the integration is not

506
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,160
here i uh so you probably probably want

507
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,240
to uh run some kind of

508
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,400
write some kind of your own functions so

509
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,679
it's also have integration with

510
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,280
javascript or you had integration with

511
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,080
uh with python um so that those kind of

512
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
functions enable you to uh smoothly uh

513
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,640
or even like a reuse or ui existing code

514
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,400
for example you have you already write

515
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,160
some code would write like python you

516
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,799
know to do some uh scraping or or

517
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,240
scanning i think those kind of things

518
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,160
you can always

519
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,480
fit in fitting here that combined with

520
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,440
them compute your own your own new logic

521
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,320
um

522
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,080
and in terms of logical functions either

523
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,520
already have a bunch of things like give

524
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,960
you like a split joints which uh uh for

525
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,280
example is like a parts like getting

526
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,679
data like getting one by one switch is

527
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,760
that that you can do if else right you

528
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,120
have multiple conditions you can have

529
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,480
multiple conditions

530
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
if something happens something happens

531
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,679
and let's do this if something happens

532
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,960
as you let i mean that's very common

533
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,840
logic

534
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,919
uh in in the data operation data

535
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,360
operations and then no really have all

536
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
this confidence building

537
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,480
um so and also it has like a third-party

538
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,320
third-party integrations and lots of

539
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,039
third-party third-party integrations uh

540
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,559
with different different security

541
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,480
different security tools qualities rapid

542
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,760
saving and

543
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,000
service now so and so forth uh so those

544
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,760
kind of things basically is api based so

545
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,600
you have a uh all this platform they

546
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,280
have api and now you have you can

547
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,960
connect to their you know connect to the

548
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
apis and um

549
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,240
uh

550
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,480
connect connect to the apis and uh and

551
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,679
uh and

552
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,919
and you complete your your tasks like

553
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,679
for example you have a crosstrack and

554
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,960
you can always pull data from the

555
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,400
crosstrack whether that's detection

556
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
without the instance or whether you want

557
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,160
to close a crosstracking instance or

558
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
where you want to uh analyze getting the

559
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,080
host information of the crosstrack and

560
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,960
so

561
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,799
the api is already there you don't need

562
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,280
to rebuild the viewer wheels and the api

563
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,320
will get you to do the slow stuff

564
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,600
um

565
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,039
and then and in terms of workflow

566
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,799
management once we have the workflow in

567
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,799
place we can we can we can save them

568
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,400
into the we can save them into the

569
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,600
playbooks we can save them into the uh

570
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,520
we can save them into the playbooks a

571
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
variety of different kind of playbooks

572
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,120
you can drag and drop and if you have

573
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,000
already reviewed a bunch of things

574
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,480
this is a somewhat complicated some of

575
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,120
uh some are easier uh so you can always

576
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,720
save them uh the good thing is you you

577
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
can you can because you can

578
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,720
share them with the community and

579
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,039
leverage whatever community with build

580
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,760
so you can yeah you can share them with

581
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
is essentially just some format you can

582
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,919
share them with with your colleagues

583
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,520
like just copy paste this kind of json

584
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,280
format and then they can they can import

585
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,360
it into their environment center and run

586
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,678
as well

587
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,360
[Music]

588
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,400
so

589
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,720
uh so i'll i'll get two demos i'll get a

590
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,080
two more demos uh why is let's see uh

591
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
uh so besides i can look at eyepiece

592
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,120
let's see like there's some uh

593
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,720
um

594
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,960
there's lots of time-consuming part is

595
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,720
really like a part of the data data

596
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,080
parsing uh so we have uh

597
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,840
it's a little bit more like uh

598
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,799
um uh the utility functions like the

599
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,480
target for security teams like for

600
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,039
example extra urls especially like when

601
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,200
you analyze something like let's let's

602
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
just write some

603
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,960
random text here uh so it's getting

604
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,320
parsley

605
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,039
random text

606
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,080
something else

607
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,360
and you want to so there's some tasks

608
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,960
you want to analyze these these emails

609
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
right like analyze these urls so

610
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,159
uh so you can you can always go through

611
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,400
this kind of automation and and get you

612
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,960
back the page back the uis do the ioc

613
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,679
abstractions uh you have the host name

614
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,320
if you have the ips if you have urls and

615
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,880
those kind of things or can go through

616
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,640
these kind of utility functions and

617
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,200
let's get to the last demo so we have

618
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,080
the we have ip enrichment here and we

619
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,480
have the uh we have the parsing here and

620
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,400
now let's go to the phishing and you if

621
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,919
you remember phishing when you have the

622
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,919
emails and you you need to parse the

623
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,760
headers and you pass the urls you get

624
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,360
attachments you need and then you need

625
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,280
to correlate it with uh with virus flow

626
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,200
you need correlated with hyper analysis

627
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,720
and you based on different information

628
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,240
you will need to send out different

629
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,760
different notifications

630
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
so here this this automation basically

631
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,080
is taking you taking the personal emails

632
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,799
and uh and go through parsley parser

633
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,919
email read emails parse emails and uh

634
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,400
and go through the

635
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,360
aristotle and you have two conditions

636
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,039
you will check if also give you

637
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
information if it's malicious if it's

638
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,400
malicious let's send the email let's

639
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,960
send an email to say oh this one is uh

640
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,039
this one is the phishing emails if not

641
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,559
let's send it let's send an email saying

642
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,080
there's nothing no you should find these

643
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,120
emails

644
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,760
so and in our testing environments i'll

645
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,840
say i'll show you

646
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,480
uh that we have uh

647
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,080
essentially we have a

648
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
uh

649
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,600
we have two we have two emails here uh

650
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,799
anyways

651
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,919
two emails

652
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,080
we have two two emails here uh i'll

653
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,000
quickly run this one so and then you can

654
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,559
you should expect to see the we can send

655
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,480
emails here notification here let's

656
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
quickly run this one

657
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
so now it's it's connecting to the

658
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,240
emails uh and

659
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
you can see we even have red red limited

660
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,400
control here there are two emails it's

661
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,880
doing uh so why is uh so why it's

662
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,760
parsing now and then once it's done uh

663
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,520
you can see it's connecting to the web

664
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,919
api so it's text time uh but these kind

665
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,280
of things already once you once you see

666
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,639
the result you start automatically

667
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,159
and you see like it's give you status

668
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,120
it's done

669
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
is done and then let's look at

670
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
the inbox here

671
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,000
so you can see i received the email

672
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,400
phish email was detected so you can see

673
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,919
it's getting it run automatically

674
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,520
um okay

675
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,320
so

676
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,440
um yeah i think that's yeah i have 25

677
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,640
minutes uh done um so this is all i have

678
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,120
and uh i'm ready to take any questions

679
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,480
yeah thanks for the time thanks for

680
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,480
organizers organizers again here

681
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,600
so i think skelly had a question

682
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,679
i did and i remember to unmute this time

683
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,480
yeah so um question for you peter how

684
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
difficult is this to learn and what are

685
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
some other use cases that it could be

686
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,679
useful for

687
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,640
um

688
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,000
so how

689
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
okay that's that's a good question here

690
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,960
so

691
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
so it's uh so getting started it takes

692
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,200
like uh one second probably it's taken

693
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,559
one second you can get started with your

694
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,840
first uh first baby workflow um and the

695
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,840
use cases as i mentioned all these kind

696
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,480
of use cases is doable we have been

697
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,159
using them and we have been

698
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,679
working with different teams on this

699
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,120
stuff yeah so

700
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,279
uh all these use cases we have we have

701
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,000
hands-on like implementation stuff yeah

702
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,480
it's it's almost i mean it's almost from

703
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,400
all these kind of aspects yeah even like

704
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,640
going goes beyond the blue teams to

705
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,559
rating stuff here

706
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,480
awesome yeah yeah

707
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,960
thank you so much that was great um

708
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,400
mikos do you have any more questions for

709
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,080
peter

710
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,440
i mean

711
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,840
i was wondering a little bit uh how one

712
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,720
could extend it for example okay so we

713
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,760
have some

714
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,440
some form of uh

715
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
automation could we eventually hook in

716
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,200
uh elastic as a service for this to then

717
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,600
perform operations on an elastic

718
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,320
yeah so yeah so you actually we have uh

719
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,240
uh the let's the platforms already have

720
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,320
uh have you asked this integration uh

721
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,679
you know talking to the talk to the

722
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,840
index and that is this goes beyond the

723
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,120
usage goes to uh raza goes to uh you

724
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,520
name it spanx it goes to uh

725
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,600
yeah how well goes to every opposition

726
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,000
another the exam being all those kind of

727
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,080
things here

728
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
awesome

729
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,600
we're just a bit curious so yeah

730
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,960
fantastic

731
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,919
um

732
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,520
we don't really have that many questions

733
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,480
uh

734
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,840
actually in chat

735
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,279
as uh

736
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,200
i'm actually uh

737
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,919
uh pleasantly surprised um i think the

738
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,520
word is

739
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,240
excited that the live demo worked

740
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,799
perfectly

741
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,950
that's always a challenging part

742
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,400
[Laughter]

743
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,200
oh we did uh just get a question aha uh

744
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
would it be possible for the workflows

745
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,120
that you showed to be designed in the ui

746
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,440
like you did and then be

747
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,679
executed from a command line interface

748
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,679
exactly in command yeah so i think the

749
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,279
the way to do that is really like you

750
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,240
have you set up a workflow with

751
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,120
api and api endpoints and you rather you

752
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
you just call your api inputs from your

753
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,039
command line okay

754
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,880
awesome

755
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,320
that sounds

756
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,520
interesting

757
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,200
new perspectives for security automation
