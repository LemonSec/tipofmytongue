1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,120
okay thank you thank you everyone so

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,640
good day so

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,240
for today we'll be talking about the

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,599
trifecta of email authentication

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,639
so before that let me introduce myself

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,880
so my name is dee nice i'm just kidding

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,560
it's dennis

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,039
and i am a service worker security

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,840
analyst i've been in the industry for i

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,519
think almost a year now

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,320
my anniversary would be next month if i

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,640
can if i recall that perfectly

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,558
so quick background on how i got in

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,280
cyber security i was listening to this

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,320
podcast on spotify it's called darknet

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,559
diaries i think most of you know about

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,440
it

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,920
so i listened to all the episodes and

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,320
one episode really stuck with me

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,039
is the episode 30 which is the

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,559
shamoon if yeah that's correct so the

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,520
guest speaker there was chris kobeka

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,719
and after listening to her story i got

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,640
really really inspired

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,039
and i told myself oh i want to be like

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,920
chris i want to be like her so from

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,799
there

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,280
i got in touch with her i messaged her

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,799
and i connected with her and i asked her

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,000
the things

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,680
on what should i do

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,159
to be in cyber security then she gave me

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,759
different points

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,759
i tried the red teaming and the blue

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,799
teaming side and eventually like i

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,799
kind of fell in love with the defending

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,840
side

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,400
so fast forward year 2021

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,040
i got my first insect job so i got i got

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,720
it through twitter

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,439
so i never thought of that

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,600
and

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
but before before in cyber security i

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,799
was working in software testing

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,920
for about seven to eight years if that's

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,280
correct

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,159
yeah seven to eight years then moved to

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
cyber security

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,560
and also people told me to include the

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
fun parts about myself i just thought

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,200
these are the fun parts about me so

52
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,119
in our family i'm the only spokesperson

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,360
of my dog and also i'm a huge fan of

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
drinking water so

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
this is a reminder to drink your glass

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,480
of water

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,319
okay

58
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,319
so

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,599
portug today's agenda

60
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,080
we'll be talking about the spf dkm and

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,239
dmarc why they matter and the online

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,440
resources you can use to check if these

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
three are implemented in your

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,959
organization

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,280
before we start we know that phishing

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,879
attacks are really common especially

67
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,680
today at some point we might have

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
received emails from domains

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,280
from different and or malicious entities

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,680
that pretending to be someone else so

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,760
how do we protect our domains from being

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,840
spoofed by cyber criminals

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
so today you will learn how these three

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,560
things work together to secure and

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,159
protect your organizations to me we'll

76
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,359
start with spf

77
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,720
spf what is spf so spf stands for sender

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,239
policy framework

79
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,040
it is a text record that you published

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,599
in your dns server

81
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,319
it lets you configure ip addresses

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,799
or third party services that can set in

83
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,440
behalf of your organization

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,879
this could be the

85
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,879
third party services that your marketing

86
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,560
team uses

87
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,519
it lets you protect from cyber criminals

88
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,599
trying to spoof your domain

89
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,440
so if you have this in place it will

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
lessen your email

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,480
to be marked as spam

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
so how does spf or center policy

93
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799
framework work so for example here i

94
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,799
have deep's company for example i have

95
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,640
my own company

96
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,680
and in this company i have published a

97
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,120
tns the spf record in my dns server

98
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,599
and someone from my organization

99
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
sends an email outside

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,720
my organization so what happens is the

101
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,200
recipient mail server receives that

102
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,959
email and will check if the spf record

103
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,358
matches the one that i published in my

104
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,880
dns server

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,680
so once it matches what happens is the

106
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
recipient will receive the email that i

107
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
have sent out or

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,280
my employee

109
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,360
sent out

110
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
what happens if it fails

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,759
so what happens if it does not match the

112
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,560
one i publish in my dns server

113
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,520
so

114
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,440
what happens is it will be

115
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
rejected

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,000
or it will be marked as spam

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,080
next slide we'll be talking about

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,680
spf what does an spf record look like

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
so here this is the

120
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,120
text record that you publish in your

121
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,100
then a server

122
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,840
[Music]

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,479
we have here the these equals to spf one

124
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,039
this is the standard standard one

125
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,960
this is the version we all use so it

126
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
cannot be changed

127
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,440
and the ipv4 is the list of addresses

128
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
that are allowed to send in behalf of

129
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,720
your domain

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,039
this could be

131
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,639
ipv6 or ipv4

132
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
and the include one is again the

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,280
dimension the third party services

134
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,120
and the dash all

135
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,800
this is one of the mechanism which we

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
will discuss later

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,960
this just means reject all emails that

138
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,560
do not match the

139
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,360
spf record that i published in my dns

140
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,759
server

141
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,639
spf mechanisms so as previously

142
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,960
discussed in the previous slide

143
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,840
we have the different spf mechanisms so

144
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
we have the pass

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
soft fail and heart fail

146
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240
so the hard fail again just means reject

147
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
all emails that are not

148
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
authorized to send in

149
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,080
my behalf

150
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
and the software this means that

151
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,000
suspicious emails

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,960
are not really rejected but put it in

153
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,080
the in quarantine

154
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,960
and the past one this

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,520
this means that accept all emails even

156
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
if the hosts

157
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,800
the hosts are not allowed to send for us

158
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
so this is not really recommended

159
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,160
because you're just letting anyone to

160
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,039
send

161
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,400
in behalf of your domain

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,560
so we have discussed

163
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,039
what an spf record and what it looks

164
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,000
like

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
next we will proceed to

166
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
dkm

167
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,560
dkim

168
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,639
or dkim stands for domain ts identified

169
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,160
mail

170
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
dk dkim uses public key cryptography

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,000
this method

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,080
allows us to know if the message was

173
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,160
altered during transit

174
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,360
and

175
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,120
as we all know the cia tried the

176
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,240
confidentiality integrity and

177
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,800
availability so dkm fulfills the

178
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
integrity part for

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,400
the cia triad because as we all know

180
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
integrity just means that

181
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,639
making sure that the data was not

182
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,880
altered in transit

183
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
and

184
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,840
it went in news and during story

185
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,049
[Music]

186
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,599
so

187
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,240
next one we will discuss

188
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,520
how

189
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,840
dkm

190
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,359
works it's a bit complicated but

191
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
let's get into it

192
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,759
so when you send an email the server

193
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,759
generates a hash encrypted with a

194
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,039
private key

195
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,039
this private is only available and

196
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,720
accessible to you

197
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,599
and along with its corresponding public

198
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,879
key that is published in your dns server

199
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,560
so once received

200
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,120
the receive recipient mail server

201
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,560
will look up the sender's public key

202
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,199
and will verify if it matches the one

203
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,759
that you publish in your dns server

204
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,599
so once they match

205
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,479
you

206
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,080
it will use the key to decrypt the

207
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,759
signature

208
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,840
and

209
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,440
lastly the receiving mail server will

210
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,039
generate a hash

211
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,440
based from the email received

212
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,400
then it will compare the

213
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,360
decrypted hash and the freshly

214
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,840
generated hash so you have two things

215
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,759
here for the game

216
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,080
they say who they say they are

217
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
and

218
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,679
you have verified that the message was

219
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,120
not altered

220
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,080
during transit

221
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,159
so what does a game signature look like

222
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,760
so here we have the game signature

223
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,720
that

224
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,560
we use

225
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,959
here is we have the face equals to one

226
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,240
this is the

227
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,880
standard version i'm just including all

228
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,640
the mandatory fields for the dkm

229
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,959
signature but you can also

230
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,120
look up the optional tags you can use

231
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,240
depending

232
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
on your

233
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,519
organization

234
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,080
we have here another one is the

235
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,200
algorithm used to generate the signature

236
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,880
so we have the

237
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,000
rsa-256 this is the most commonly used

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,240
and the d is the

239
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,519
domain the domain of the sender

240
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,440
and the s

241
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,839
indicates the selector record name to

242
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,240
locate the public key in the dns

243
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,720
and the b the b ph is the body hash

244
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,440
and the b is equal to the this is the

245
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,839
actual signature of the content both

246
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,320
headers and the body

247
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,519
so again

248
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,519
for dkim you can verify two things

249
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,839
that they are who they say they are

250
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,880
and

251
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,560
that the message was not out there

252
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,920
during transit again it fulfills the the

253
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,760
integrity in the cia trial

254
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
next one

255
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,839
next one is dmart

256
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,920
so what is the mark

257
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
dmarc stands for domain based

258
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,120
authentication reporting and conformance

259
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,519
mark policy started appearing in year

260
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,959
2012

261
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,519
so it instructs the receiving mail

262
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,399
servers how they should process

263
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,959
emails from that domain should they fail

264
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,519
the spf and the kim

265
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,000
or should if spf and the game are not

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,040
aligned

267
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
then the email the email will undergo

268
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
depending on the

269
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,519
policy that you have set

270
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,399
so

271
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,640
dmarc also gives reports

272
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
about the insides of your

273
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,839
domain how your domain is being used

274
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,800
it also includes the

275
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,959
it also includes malicious actors or

276
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,200
cyber criminals that are claiming or

277
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,040
pretending to be you

278
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,480
next time

279
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
so

280
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,800
we were talking about the policies so

281
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,480
how will it work

282
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,839
for example you have checked

283
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,560
spf record and the game you have checked

284
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
that they are both passed then the

285
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,200
recipient will receive the email

286
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
but what if it does not what if it fails

287
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,160
it depends on you so

288
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,480
the mark has three different policies

289
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,360
the

290
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,800
quarantine

291
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,240
none and rejected

292
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,600
so

293
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,560
we'll go first with quarantine so

294
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
quarantine

295
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,880
if the dmarc authentication fails it

296
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
tells the receiving mail server to

297
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,120
quarantine the email

298
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,560
and none

299
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
just means no action taken

300
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,360
but the email will still be delivered

301
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,839
to the

302
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
recipient and reject

303
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,560
this means to reject all unauthorized

304
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,760
emails

305
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,600
so just to add reports our reports are

306
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,200
sent daily for the mark

307
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,399
so

308
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,040
the dmarc policy

309
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,480
this is what

310
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,200
the mark policy looks like so

311
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
this equals to the mark 1 this is the

312
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,040
standard version

313
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
so

314
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,959
it should not be changed or else

315
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
the entry

316
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
will be discarded and the p is equals to

317
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,720
policy again

318
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,760
you have three things the quarantine

319
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,040
none and reject and the pct is the

320
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,240
percentage how

321
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
it depends you can set it

322
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
either 50

323
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,560
will require 50 of the email will be

324
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,160
quarantined

325
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,440
or 100 percent of the emails will be

326
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,079
will get rejected

327
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,200
and

328
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
we have here the rua this this is where

329
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,920
the reports are sent to

330
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,279
so

331
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,200
every day again

332
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,720
reports are sent daily

333
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
i think as of now you are wondering if

334
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,560
your organization has this in place or

335
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,839
if your organization

336
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,600
have this implemented

337
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,079
and if not you can tell your security

338
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,920
team that hey

339
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,320
we can use this tool to

340
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,639
secure our domains

341
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,120
to avoid cyber criminals from spoofing

342
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,680
our own domains

343
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,920
you can let your security team know

344
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,199
using this

345
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,639
different tools

346
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,720
so first we have the spf so for example

347
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,560
i have here

348
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,680
the one that google uses

349
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,680
so for google they use the software

350
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,440
in their spf record so this is what is

351
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,920
what's published in their dns

352
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,519
server

353
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
the next one again

354
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,279
if you do not have the spf record

355
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,279
in place in your organization you can

356
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,760
use this still this tool

357
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,959
to generate your own spf record

358
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,320
the next one

359
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,279
this is the dkim generator

360
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,399
again like the previous slides this will

361
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,240
help you generate your

362
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,199
dqm record for organization and you can

363
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
also use this tool to

364
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,839
look up if you have valid or

365
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,000
you have implemented this in your

366
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,800
organization

367
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,680
and here we have the dmarc record

368
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
generator as you can see i'm a huge fan

369
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,399
of

370
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,880
mx toolbox

371
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,079
and

372
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,279
so if you use mx toolbox for example

373
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,079
i

374
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,199
included google here again as an example

375
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,560
so mx toolbox lets you know how to

376
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,360
create the the mark record so they ask

377
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
you different things

378
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
and then for example how do you want

379
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,160
that

380
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,320
how do you want mail that fails the mark

381
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,399
to be treated by recipient again it's

382
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,320
funded rejected quarantined or none

383
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,120
and the email addresses

384
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,560
where the reports are sent to

385
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,880
and

386
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,720
lastly

387
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,519
these are this is what mx toolbox will

388
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,720
suggest

389
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,759
should you not have the dmarc record in

390
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,320
place for your organization

391
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,279
so

392
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,480
this is google's current record in the

393
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,440
mx space from

394
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,519
mx box

395
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,360
next oops i think that's it

396
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,279
okay it was that quick

397
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,160
okay so i hope you learned something

398
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,759
from this talk

399
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,279
and if you

400
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,360
if you do not have all these three

401
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,160
things in place

402
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,800
you should let your security team know

403
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,320
that

404
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
these three things are important to

405
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,959
secure our domain and

406
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,440
to avoid cyber criminals or malicious

407
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,480
actors

408
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,440
from pretending to be our organization

409
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,160
or

410
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,079
pretending to be us

411
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,199
so

412
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,680
if you wish to contact me you have i

413
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,720
have this twitter and discord

414
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,959
and

415
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,000
i think that's it

416
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,880
awesome

417
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,199
we have had a bit of engagement um on

418
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,399
it is

419
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,959
quite interesting uh

420
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,600
do we have any questions in chat

421
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,639
let us see

422
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,240
so

423
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,279
oops

424
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,000
was having a stroke

425
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
um there we go

426
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
i had a question for you

427
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,959
specifically

428
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:01,759
this

429
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,519
implementation

430
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,599
so if you were to

431
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,000
go through the trifecta and try to uh

432
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,520
bring an organization up to the standard

433
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,679
right so that they can

434
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,359
be safe

435
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,160
who would take care of this in a company

436
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,919
would it be the security team would it

437
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,160
be assist admin would it be both

438
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,880
i mean i think they

439
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,240
they

440
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
those teams should work together that's

441
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,120
what we currently do in our company so

442
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,520
we consult each other

443
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,400
and

444
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,520
we also

445
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,880
for our

446
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,799
for our spf

447
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,000
because there are sometimes the

448
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,640
third party services that we do not use

449
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,960
anymore so we have to remove that so

450
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,559
they let us know hey this specific

451
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,840
third-party services that we use to use

452
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
are not

453
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,880
are not

454
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
with our company anymore so we remove

455
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
that so

456
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,679
it prevents them from

457
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,919
trying to send email in behalf of us

458
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,640
even if they're not connected with our

459
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,039
company anymore

460
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,039
uh we've had one question um on twitch

461
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,679
and one on discord i'll start with the

462
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,679
one on discord scribblydo asks uh what

463
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,559
misconfigurations can happen with spf

464
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,840
dkim or

465
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,320
dmarc sorry can you please repeat it

466
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,200
what misconfigurations can happen with

467
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,120
spf dkim or dmarc

468
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,919
so

469
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,360
well

470
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,600
so spf record so

471
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,679
what i've noticed what i've experienced

472
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,120
the

473
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,320
the standard version was changed then

474
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
the recipient mail server did not

475
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,480
acknowledge that one so

476
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,679
for

477
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,280
spf and the game the versions should not

478
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,679
be changed and

479
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,400
data or the one the ip addresses should

480
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,840
be

481
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,320
should be correct

482
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,840
that you publish in your dns

483
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,679
server awesome

484
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,760
and the next question is

485
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,919
uh do you find this was easy to

486
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,280
implement at work or did you have any

487
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,799
pushback from any other departments

488
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,960
perhaps

489
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,840
yeah

490
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,160
so what i have experienced so we

491
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,320
consulted the

492
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,280
marketing in our in our company so we've

493
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,240
cons

494
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,760
consulted them

495
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
on the regarding the third party

496
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,480
services that they use

497
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,200
and the third party marketing services

498
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,960
that are

499
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
published in our records so there are

500
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,360
times that

501
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
the marketing team will let you know

502
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,679
that hey we're gonna use this anymore

503
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:49,920
so

504
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,280
[Music]

505
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,840
it's also important that you connect

506
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,480
with other teams regarding this so for

507
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,039
accurate in information

508
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,600
and again for

509
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,959
protection of your domain
