organizers for uh for this opportunity

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,320
to tell you more about the next

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,880
generation of peace builders but before

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,960
i do so let me tell you a few words

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,119
about the cyber peace institute

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,519
the cyber peace institute was created in

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,760
2019 in geneva switzerland by our

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
founding partners microsoft hewlett

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,720
foundation

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
mastercard among others

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,840
and

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,640
assist them we now count 27 staff of

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,320
different nationalities and coming from

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,760
various backgrounds

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,719
and our mission is to build cyberpeace

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,960
now how are we doing that

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,559
the way we do this is uh i apologize

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,239
the way we do this

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,559
is by working together across three main

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,160
teams here at the institut the

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,480
assistance analysis and advancement team

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,399
in assistance we assist humanitarian

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,960
ngos with their cyber security needs

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,280
when we do so we collect stories stories

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,479
that we then share with our colleagues

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,200
in analysis to document to research and

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,680
to analyze to then inform our colleagues

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,600
in advancement who work to create

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,439
policies policies at the u.n and

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,920
international level

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,680
now

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
why are we doing this like what's the

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,799
rationale

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,960
behind doing all this what's the need

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
actually so as some of you might know

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,840
before covid 740 million people lived in

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,439
extreme poverty

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
now with kovit with the pandemic this

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
number is going to

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,119
rise by 150 million people

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,640
these people

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,799
encounter huge barriers in terms of

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,000
social economic sanitary uh political

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,240
life due to conflict natural disasters

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,200
and the least so long it can go on for

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,720
the rest of my talk um now

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,640
these people they depend on the critical

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,799
services offered by ngos by humanitarian

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,680
ngos who in turn they depend

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,560
on donations donations coming from

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
different institutions private public

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,878
from government and from private

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,038
individuals

58
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,160
now

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,239
we did some research and we realized

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
that humanitarian organizations actually

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,599
raised around 30 billion dollars

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,720
annually

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,920
now i do not know if you knew that

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
but cyber criminals do

65
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,520
several criminals also know that only

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,920
one in 10 ngos train their staff on

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,000
cyber security matters

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
only one in four ngos monitor their

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
network for any kind of suspicious

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
activity and only one in five has any

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,959
kind of cyber security strategy or plan

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,360
now

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,840
you see attacks on humanitarian ngos are

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
not something new

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
however since there is no protections

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,720
his protection is so low and there is

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
nothing really put in place these are

78
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,680
easy attacks that imply very low risks

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,480
for

80
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,200
uh

81
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,760
for for for for the perpetrators for the

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
cyber criminals and also a big payout if

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,840
you refer to the slide before where we

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,760
saw how much money this humanitarian

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
ngos raised annually to help vulnerable

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,040
people

87
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
now according to our research

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,200
around 500 attacks were committed since

89
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
2016.

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,560
each one of them are different

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,400
intensity or severity as you can see

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
depending on you know the money or

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
the data stolen and the damage

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,319
now because of this we realized that

95
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,760
cyberpeace begins with the most

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
vulnerable the most vulnerable being the

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,239
people this humanitarian ngos help

98
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,200
but

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,560
in order to

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,879
in order to be able to support them we

101
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,480
realize that it's important to protect

102
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,239
this mantra and ngos to be able to carry

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,400
out their their job to deliver critical

104
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,159
services to these people

105
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,599
and that's how

106
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,040
the cyber peace builders came to be

107
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,400
that's our solution to this challenge

108
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,799
now what are the builders

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,799
what do they do what do they offer

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,640
now the cyber peace builders are cyber

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,280
security experts coming from all trades

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
and they are employed by local and

113
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,840
international companies

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,720
uh thanks to them we can offer um three

115
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,239
different types of services three

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,200
pillars

117
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,279
the first pillar of services that we can

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,440
offer are pre-incident uh we can do

119
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,320
security assessments of ngo systems

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
we do cyber security training for all

121
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,639
staff to render them more aware of all

122
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,560
cyber security threats

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,240
we help them with their security policy

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
cyber security policies and we also do

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
vulnerability scans of their emails and

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,440
websites now let me give you an example

127
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,800
last year

128
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,919
in summer end of summer 2021 uh one of

129
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,919
our beneficial organizations the union

130
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,600
for international cancer control got

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,919
their instagram account hacked

132
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,040
um

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,320
they

134
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,080
they got it they got this account hacked

135
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
because they received a phishing email

136
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
claiming that um um

137
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
they had some sort of copyrighted

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
infringement and of course when you see

139
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,919
something like this you say oh no this

140
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,199
is serious let's you know take care of

141
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,560
this we didn't want to do any kind of

142
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,680
copyright

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,520
but they fell in the trap and then two

144
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,120
days later on the cyber criminals

145
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,199
contacted them via whatsapp

146
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,960
telling them yeah we have your account

147
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
and if you want to get uh access

148
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
if you want to regain access you have to

149
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,960
pay this many thousands of ranks in

150
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,199
bitcoin by following this link

151
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,440
uh the union for international cancer

152
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
control or uicc they did join the

153
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,039
therapist builders and we managed to

154
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
help them with this issue but we also

155
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,720
managed to improve the overall

156
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,120
cybersecurity infrastructure

157
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,919
the second pillar of support

158
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,000
that we offer is a

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,680
post incident

160
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,160
um here we can we can do open source

161
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,520
intelligence as we recently did actually

162
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,199
not in the context of the cyber business

163
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,720
part in the context of the ukraine

164
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,199
conflict where we developed a ukraine

165
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,280
timeline of cyberattacks

166
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
we also do darkway monitoring to inform

167
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
attack notification but we also do

168
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,680
recovery and investigations to be able

169
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
to properly notify our beneficiaries the

170
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,400
humanitarian ngos we work with now just

171
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,160
to give you an example in terms of uh

172
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
investigations

173
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,039
um in december last year um the

174
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,280
institute has discovered this

175
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,880
um this uh phishing campaign that uh it

176
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,720
was targeting specifically ngo

177
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
humanitarian ngos by working with some

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,919
private partners we realized that the

179
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,599
cyber criminals they were leveraging

180
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,520
a gap security issue in outlook and they

181
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
were sending phishing emails containing

182
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,479
malware

183
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,400
after all this research after all these

184
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,160
open source intelligence uh

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,560
dissemination gathering uh my colleagues

186
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,199
informed all our ngos all the all our

187
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,800
partner ngos

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,600
that not only about this trap

189
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,160
um the last pillar of support is just

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,680
general support

191
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,960
where we do uh coaching uh for managers

192
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
um more precisely how do we talk about

193
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,880
cyber security

194
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,840
um

195
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,759
how do we talk about

196
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,599
a cyber attack in case especially in

197
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,759
case if we get one

198
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,199
how do we position ourselves is cyber

199
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,280
security only managers responsibility or

200
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,759
is it everybody's responsibility and

201
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,919
it's everybody's responsibility we do

202
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,520
tend to take a very human-centric

203
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,160
approach when it comes to this

204
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,280
the other services we offer legal advice

205
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,800
in terms of data protection and data

206
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
privacy uh marketing and design of

207
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,919
publications related to cyber security

208
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,479
issues or creating resources for these

209
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,680
ngos

210
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,520
to be able to access quickly and

211
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,479
implement them themselves easily and at

212
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,039
no cost whatsoever

213
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,639
now going back to what i said before

214
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,240
about the builders who are cyber

215
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
security experts employed by local or

216
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
international companies so these

217
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,199
builders they volunteer between 20 hours

218
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,840
to 40 hours a year to protect ngos

219
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,960
online

220
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,039
on the side of the ngos after we connect

221
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,560
with them we discuss what their needs

222
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
are then we create missions missions

223
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,319
that are listed on our cooperation

224
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,000
platform

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
the purpose of our cooperation platform

226
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
is twofold let's say

227
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,039
on one side it's for this humanitarian

228
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,520
ngo to have a safe space to be able to

229
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
share their experiences their worries

230
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
and to get the necessary help they need

231
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,919
but also on the other

232
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,759
is to ensure that the builders get

233
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,759
access to a community of professionals

234
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,000
they get access to training and they get

235
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,639
access to uh to concrete

236
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,160
help to improve their skills and to

237
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,680
maintain their certifications as well

238
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,159
now

239
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,839
just to give you a quick

240
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,279
overview of where we stand

241
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,479
we launched the program in october 2021

242
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
since then now we count more than 40

243
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
humanitarian ngos

244
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
uh to be more precise with you we have

245
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,440
around 44 right now uh from almost all

246
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,160
over the world actually um and uh this

247
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,800
far we managed to create 87 missions

248
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,360
out of which 52 are completed or about

249
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
to be completed

250
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,160
and um 35 are still open now new

251
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
missions are being added weekly um the

252
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,800
demand for this service it's for this

253
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,959
partnership actually it's it's big and

254
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,680
we're very happy to see that that uh it

255
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
it adds such a huge value to the work of

256
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
the humanitarian jobs

257
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,360
now

258
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,160
just to give you a quick overview of uh

259
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,080
the company supporting us

260
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,680
you will certainly recognize some of

261
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,399
them such as microsoft uh telefonica

262
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,040
probably logitech spelling team

263
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,959
and um here is what our ngos have to say

264
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,399
about us

265
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,360
now

266
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,120
um

267
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,760
we got these testimonials

268
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,279
at the end of each mission actually what

269
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,640
we do at the end of each mission is to

270
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,279
create a survey that we share to measure

271
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,240
satisfaction but also to see what we can

272
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,680
improve in the program

273
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,519
and these testimonials actually show the

274
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,959
added value and the impact of the

275
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,320
program and we are very happy to

276
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
continue to work with our beneficiaries

277
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,000
and to expand even more

278
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,760
now to be completely transparent with

279
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,720
you

280
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,880
the server piece builders is free for

281
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,200
ngos and it's going to stay free

282
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
but the program has fixed and various

283
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
costs and that is why we run on

284
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,240
philanthropic and corporate donations

285
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,760
from the companies that you have

286
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,519
previously seen practically the way it

287
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,360
goes these companies they do provide us

288
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,680
with financial support and also people

289
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,480
the builders when we um

290
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
when we look for builders these people

291
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,839
must have been working for the company

292
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,600
that we are talking to for at least a

293
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,360
year before being able to join the

294
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,040
program but when they join the program

295
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
they represent december peace builders

296
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
they they are a cyber peace builder

297
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,959
working for mentoring new jobs

298
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,000
um

299
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,880
that's

300
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,320
all on my side

301
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,279
um

302
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,440
i hope um it was it was clear and um i

303
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
am open to your questions thank you very

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,040
much for your attention and

305
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,800
awesome thank you so much for that

306
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,880
presentation i think nikos has just

307
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,279
dipped um but you do have some questions

308
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,399
in chat

309
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
so uh first question is what are the

310
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,399
first steps that ngos should do to be

311
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,560
more protected

312
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
well the first steps an ngo should do to

313
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,839
be more protected is to literally take

314
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,920
the time to invest in the training of

315
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,680
their staff

316
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
cyber security it's on one side about

317
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,279
technology and on the other it's about

318
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,480
people

319
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,120
and people are at the forefront

320
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
of most of the cyber security issues

321
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,959
ngoc counter

322
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,880
uh so what

323
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,200
so and humanitarian ngo the first thing

324
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,720
they can do is to really invest into

325
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,800
training people and developing their

326
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,839
security and protection

327
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,240
measures

328
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,639
awesome thank you so much and another

329
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,800
question just came in and it says

330
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,680
uh

331
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,320
also can anyone become a builder is that

332
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,680
like uh something that's open to the

333
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,880
public

334
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
uh as a matter of fact uh just as i

335
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,600
mentioned at the end of my presentation

336
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,800
um

337
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
well the person who like to become a

338
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,399
builder has to be employed by a company

339
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,760
and they must have been working for that

340
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,320
company for a year unfortunately we

341
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,519
cannot um we cannot work for the time

342
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,120
being with people who are self-employed

343
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,959
or working individually

344
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,760
um i hope that answers the question

345
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,399
that it does and someone else followed

346
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,480
up with what scope is there for people

347
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,200
to get involved

348
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,440
well

349
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
if people get involved into this program

350
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,320
let's say there are two benefits on one

351
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,480
side is the benefit of actually helping

352
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,880
humanitarian ngos working in different

353
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,439
fields in health education peace

354
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,839
and so on to actually strengthen their

355
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,760
cyber security posture

356
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,000
to improve their systems and then to be

357
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
able to deliver their critical services

358
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,079
to the vulnerable the vulnerable people

359
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,279
i i mentioned at the beginning of the

360
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,480
presentation and then secondly you see

361
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
the builders are not in a position just

362
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,600
to give

363
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
we designed this this program in such a

364
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
way that the builders yes they do give

365
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,040
time

366
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
um they do give their knowledge that we

367
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,360
give their expertise but in return there

368
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,200
is a community they can tap into they

369
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
can access a community a training um

370
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,440
training let's say on diversity and

371
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,240
inclusion on victimology on this whole

372
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,519
universe of humanitarian ngos and how um

373
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,480
how they work and how they operate so

374
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,839
there is another benefit and scope to

375
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,000
that

376
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,399
awesome thank you so much uh miss root

377
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,800
asks do you have to work specifically

378
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,560
for cyber security company for a year or

379
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,399
can it be like another company is there

380
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,839
any like uh

381
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,920
like leniency around that

382
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,760
uh there is there is a leniency for as

383
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,160
long as the job is actually in cyber so

384
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
it doesn't have to be necessarily a

385
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
technical job it can be on cyber but on

386
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
the marketing side on communications in

387
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,880
legal so we are open to

388
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,959
a lot of profiles because that's what

389
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,160
actually going to

390
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,600
make the whole experience that make the

391
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,079
whole program richer and to be able to

392
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,680
actually provide more more support and

393
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,240
help

394
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,680
awesome thank you

395
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,240
and um another question came in

396
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
which is what could convince ngos to get

397
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,880
more involved in cyber security training

398
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,040
any opinion um

399
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,160
well first of all ngos when when we talk

400
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,440
about cyber

401
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,160
the first reaction is what

402
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,279
so they they just don't know they they

403
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
they need to probably be more

404
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,320
uh exposed to the topic first of all

405
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,040
um probably uh um

406
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
they need to be first okay so first of

407
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,760
all they need to be more exposed to the

408
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,600
topic and the topic has to be maybe a

409
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,399
bit more bulgarized if that's the right

410
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,120
word to be more accessible to

411
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,279
these people working harmonious ngos who

412
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,800
just to give you an example we will work

413
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,360
with ngos who have five or six or ten

414
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,079
staff but they have no i.t person and

415
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,600
they

416
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
they realize cyber security it's a you

417
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,279
know it's a serious matter but they just

418
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,480
don't understand

419
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,800
and the way we do it on our side is to

420
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
make to have a very structured concrete

421
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,120
approach

422
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,360
that we explain things we don't just do

423
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
things without uh you know explaining

424
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,440
them and also we do it at the face of

425
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,800
ngo

426
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,120
um so i think to to answer the question

427
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,920
to sum it up it's very important to

428
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,519
render this field maybe a bit more

429
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,639
accessible to ngos and also to

430
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,759
that the industry invites ngos to

431
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,639
conferences to talks to to open a bit

432
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,880
you know the gates uh on both sides

433
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,519
yeah awesome thank you and then um yeah

434
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,600
another question has come in to look

435
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,880
back on the previous point can any kind

436
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,199
of ngo join

437
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,399
uh

438
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,720
yes so um the most

439
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,160
the most important criteria for us is

440
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,680
that the ngo

441
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,480
is uh delivering critical services it's

442
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
a humanitarian ngo

443
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
what does this mean

444
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,880
delivering critical services such as

445
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,000
health

446
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,079
nutrition education

447
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,399
peace

448
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
sometimes it's a bit difficult to

449
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,720
distinguish uh between maybe a charity

450
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,519
and a human ngo a charity probably works

451
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,079
more locally they do an amazing work and

452
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,160
it's it's it's very important why they

453
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,600
do but maybe they don't have that

454
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
international reach or they don't have

455
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,560
that critical services aspect to it

456
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,240
and that's why we focus right now only

457
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,880
for my own humanitarian ngos at the

458
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,639
beginning i hope i hope it answers the

459
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,560
question

460
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,399
definitely did thank you so much for

461
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,000
your time it was a fantastic

462
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
presentation

463
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,240
atomic any other closing remarks

464
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,480
i quite enjoyed it um

465
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
it's also quite uh quite fun you know

466
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,639
that we're literally like i think what

467
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,680
20 kilometers away from one another

468
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
so it's

469
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,559
pretty nice

470
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,000
one more last minute question came in

471
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,959
how can people support this project

472
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,599
well first of all people can start uh

473
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,799
sharing

474
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
the cyber peace builders on their social

475
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,959
media

476
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,119
in an individual capacity

477
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,959
start the conversation a bit about what

478
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,439
we're doing and how we're doing it and

479
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,959
then if

480
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
in terms of a company they would like to

481
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,960
join just drop us an email at assistance

482
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,080
cyberpsinstudio.org and then we can have

483
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,720
a discussion um see what we can put in

484
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
place and how you can support how they

485
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,039
can support the program um

486
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,400
and and and to help united ngos

487
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,559
thank you so much for this entire

488
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,720
presentation this was well put together

489
