1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,680
right i'm told we're live and i can see

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,440
us live so

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,040
welcome to the panel

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
uh nice improv chaotic panel just chat

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,160
away i've got a few questions to throw

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,320
at you and then we will just blather and

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,119
fill up time after that if we have any

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,000
so

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,080
let's kick off with a simple one first

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,480
you know really easy question for both

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
of you and let's go in alphabetical

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,080
order but why did you choose to go down

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,960
the route of cyber technology security

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,680
in particular

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,360
well

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,200
i was very lonely

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
and i found lots of friends on the

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,200
internet

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,600
i

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
see i messed around with computers a lot

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,280
and

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
i got a job messing around with

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,399
computers

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,640
because it was fun i got to learn stuff

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,239
and i didn't really have to get outside

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,640
much which was nice and easy for me

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
then

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,559
i looked at the pay grades for security

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,080
and i went yeah sure i'll do that

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,439
very much motivated by money going into

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,720
it but then i met a really nice

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,159
community full of people i wanted to

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,920
stick around with and that's why i'm

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,159
still here instead of like hopping jobs

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,360
every six months

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,040
again i've always been kind of really

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,360
interested and drawn to computers and

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,439
also how they work and like all the

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
stuff behind it and then that kind of

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,560
developed

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
as i got older into programming um

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
learning how that sort of stuff worked

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,200
and then it

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
went into how

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
that stuff was then secured

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,320
and it kind of just kept going from

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,439
there

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,439
so

49
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,399
brilliant

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,640
and since we've had the job hopping

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,439
mentioned let's go for a

52
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,880
non-controversial question next

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
do you think security is compensated

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
fairly do you think people are paid

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,479
properly there's

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,240
a lot of conversations around pay

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
there's a lot of companies trying to

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,560
crush any conversation about pay

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,159
do you think it's a discussion worth

60
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,598
having and how do you actually have that

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,878
conversation

62
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,040
so let's go in reverse order this time

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,879
just to throw it off

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,640
i think it depends where you're working

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,120
some places will pay fairly but then you

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
get the other places that don't or

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,959
there's long hours and they don't pay

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,120
you enough for certain things

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,080
um and also public versus private sector

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,800
there's a big difference in pay there as

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
well

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
so

73
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,360
and i am an advocate for discussing pay

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
rates

75
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,519
um

76
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,400
when they are particularly egregious

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,360
so i did a year in the public sector

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,040
where they paid me 18 000 pounds a year

79
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
to train

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,480
an incident response team

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
and to in my spare time also manage

82
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,400
social media for that organization

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,440
because

84
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
that's how that works for some reason

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,800
but it was a lot of fun and i learned a

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,440
lot of things unfortunately

87
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,560
it probably should have paid a little

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,239
bit more

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,800
but this is a this is another problem um

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,760
pay geographically is very very

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,120
different obviously if you go to london

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,200
you have a massively inflated pay grade

93
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
because the cost of living around there

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,640
pretty high

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,840
and then where i live in cardiff

96
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,519
people don't pay anywhere near as much

97
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,760
for people who are local because the

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
cost of living in cardiff is really

99
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,120
really low it's like one of the cheapest

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
cities to live in really nice place by

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
the way

102
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,080
so

103
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
with remote working

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
we've now realized that you can go and

105
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
get london pay

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,959
and live in cardiff

107
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,159
so

108
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,720
yeah geographical pay is really really

109
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,480
unfair sometimes particularly if you

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,519
look at

111
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,760
even bigger disparities like if you're

112
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,120
in the us

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,760
and you're getting paid like 200 000

114
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,879
a year

115
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,080
and then you look at say a job in india

116
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,640
you could be doing exactly the same role

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,239
and someone will be being paid half of

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,840
what you're getting

119
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
so pay in the industry can be

120
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,320
some of the best around in tech

121
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,880
and it's fantastic and it's really like

122
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,520
something to aspire to and get up there

123
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,000
but uh sometimes you get trapped in this

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,759
little hole where people are like oh you

125
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,919
live in the wrong place

126
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,280
and because you live in the wrong place

127
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
it doesn't matter what your skill set is

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,880
we're going to pay you this super low

129
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
wage which is like scraping by in

130
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
comparison

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
i just i don't know how industry is

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,280
going to kind of meet that with remote

133
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,440
working coming in

134
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,120
i was actually going to ask about that

135
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,880
because we've got things like digital

136
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,120
nomad schemes coming in we've got

137
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,960
various ways that people can work not

138
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,639
just remotely from a different city in

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,960
the same country but halfway around the

140
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,479
world

141
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,039
i know i've seen some companies having

142
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
to adjust to that because they don't

143
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,919
have a choice

144
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,039
but are you finding anything if you're

145
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,560
currently working looking for work

146
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
seeing people being hired are you

147
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,600
finding people

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,840
being more scattered across the world

149
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,758
and demanding the same rates of pay

150
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,120
i mean i'm not seeing i'm not seeing a

151
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,479
hell of a lot because i'm not obviously

152
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,680
a hiring manager i'm not really

153
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
particularly involved in the hiring

154
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,320
process

155
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,639
but i am seeing

156
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,240
as i kind of

157
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,759
move around and go up the chain i'm

158
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,759
seeing a lot more people from different

159
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,759
places all around the world

160
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,360
and

161
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
while i'm not 100 sure what their pay

162
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,120
grades are we should be working towards

163
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,440
that kind of parity and

164
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
you know if managers won't do it then

165
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
you talk to your friends in the business

166
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,039
you talk to your friends in industry and

167
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,400
you start sharing some of that

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,960
information maybe that'll help you

169
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,199
even the scales a bit it's a win-win

170
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,759
situation when you do that

171
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,120
it's like it's not the person at the top

172
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,639
with the most amount of money sat there

173
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,840
like i have to hoard the information

174
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
so that no one else can like ask for the

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,039
same pay grade everyone wins because

176
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,759
what happens when you get paid fairly

177
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,000
is you don't burn out as much i know a

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
lot of people who like hot jobs because

179
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,400
they want the experience

180
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,520
but they can't afford to live on the

181
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,800
amount of money they're being given for

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
it

183
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
i think also so

184
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,440
i haven't been actively working with him

185
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,520
for in within him for i always keep an

186
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
eye on the different jobs that are going

187
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,360
because i'm in university at the moment

188
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
but i have definitely seen a difference

189
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,199
recently after clovid and everything

190
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,680
that's happened in more remote jobs

191
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,800
going

192
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,840
um

193
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,840
so i think it has definitely changed

194
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,880
because that you can see that there's

195
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,080
more going than there used to be

196
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
thank you

197
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,840
okay so you you both know something

198
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
about instant response properly quite a

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,639
bit about instant response and we've got

200
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,639
a question from lady b

201
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,639
how do you think cyber threat intel can

202
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,199
play a role in helping instant response

203
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,240
get ahead of threats

204
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,919
so i am a senior threat intelligence

205
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,360
well i'm not friends

206
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,919
i get my own job description wrong i am

207
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,720
a

208
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,680
senior

209
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,919
cyber instant response

210
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,000
team analyst

211
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,039
so

212
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,880
we work really closely with our threat

213
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,639
intel team

214
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,680
which

215
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,720
you know

216
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,960
ebbs and flows as things go

217
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,759
but

218
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,599
threat intel feeds in a lot of the

219
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,120
information that we need to prepare

220
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
things ahead of time we can have an

221
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
incident plan

222
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,599
ready for something weeks even months

223
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,680
before there is actually

224
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,160
a known instance of that in our

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
environment

226
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,319
so if you get things like log4j

227
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,919
if we get that information ahead of time

228
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,039
even by 24 hours by 48 hours

229
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,759
our response plans look so much more

230
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,520
professional and so much more well put

231
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,800
together

232
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,560
because no one is scrambling and no one

233
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
is panicking

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,280
or the panic is like halfway subsided

235
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
by the time we actually get around to it

236
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,080
so

237
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
threat until it's kind of essential to

238
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,960
our jobs

239
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,039
it's not all just reactive on the back

240
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,479
foot

241
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,520
i don't know what you've done with that

242
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,160
chloe so

243
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,840
um i don't really have a lot to add to

244
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,878
what you said to be honest

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
yeah i mean

246
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,279
and do you with the stuff that you do on

247
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,000
the side and stuff that you do

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
kind of in your time do you find perhaps

249
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,039
that threatens intel would be

250
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,519
like threat until this kind of

251
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
helping lead the way

252
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
yeah definitely

253
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,680
um

254
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,279
and i think also

255
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,680
we're seeing

256
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,040
a lot more happen within it and you can

257
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
i don't know

258
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
sorry

259
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,839
because i think

260
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,959
i think one of the things we can get

261
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,880
from that is maybe

262
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
when we get that threat intelligence as

263
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,760
well a lot of things follow similar

264
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,920
patterns

265
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
so if you see

266
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
like if you see an apt do it like

267
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,680
hitting

268
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
two businesses off to the side of you or

269
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,120
like starting to hit your suppliers

270
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
and it's not come around to you yet you

271
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
have that extra time to prepare it's

272
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,640
really useful

273
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,640
i'm going to

274
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
give a question for chloe you to have

275
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,480
more to say on this one

276
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,519
yeah so

277
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,839
brace yourself

278
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
you're obviously a student so you're

279
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
studying but you're quite involved in

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,519
the general

281
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,440
let's call it security community so i

282
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,120
don't get into whether it's cyber

283
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,440
information data whichever security

284
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,200
how are you finding the

285
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
overlap between what you're learning and

286
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,519
the skills you're learning is with what

287
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,839
people are talking about you needing in

288
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,360
the industry

289
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,080
i think some of what we're taught is

290
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,079
slightly outdated but

291
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,760
some of it also overlaps with things

292
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
that we do actually need to know

293
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
um some of the software that they use is

294
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,839
outdated or they don't have

295
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,040
um

296
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,959
certain things

297
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,399
um

298
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
like new open source um software and

299
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,279
everything that's always coming out that

300
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
other people speak about within the

301
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000
industry

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,839
um

303
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,320
isn't always used at the universities

304
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,440
um

305
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
but i think also

306
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,760
a lot of it can be

307
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,320
used no matter what it is

308
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,279
so

309
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,120
say something from one tool could be

310
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
used from another because it's all about

311
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,120
how something works rather than

312
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,880
just using a tool if that makes sense

313
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,560
if you could get the university to buy

314
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,399
one software license for all students

315
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,040
what would it be

316
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,160
i think it depends in what module as

317
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,839
well for the ethical hacking probably

318
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,160
burp suite pro purely because

319
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,200
it's got everything in built within it

320
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
good choice

321
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,920
yeah

322
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
i love the pet you've already learned

323
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,800
the most important answer in security

324
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,640
okay

325
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,959
general question about security as a

326
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,200
whole again you're both

327
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,640
not new but

328
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,360
still early enough to be optimistic

329
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,279
about the industry

330
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,360
do you think organizations do you think

331
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
countries are improving in their

332
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
security posture are there common

333
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,920
mistakes that you see made or hear about

334
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
whether it's being made by security

335
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,880
people being made by companies ignoring

336
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,959
security people that could easily be

337
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,440
prevented and let's not with chloe on

338
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,959
that one because i'm interested in the

339
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,560
perspective from

340
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
your course and what you've seen and

341
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,959
then we'll go to abby's

342
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,519
actual painful experience of it not that

343
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,519
it was painful

344
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,040
um i think

345
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,880
there's always going to be people within

346
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,120
a company who don't listen to advice

347
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,639
from security teams and

348
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,920
a lot of people don't actually know what

349
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,399
they're talking about so

350
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,760
you might give them advice and they'll

351
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,279
be like oh no it's fine brush it to the

352
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,279
side and then something will happen and

353
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
they'll be like oh why don't you tell me

354
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,639
um

355
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,519
but

356
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,680
i think also it's becoming more people

357
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,000
are becoming more aware that security is

358
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
definitely a massive

359
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,279
risk factor within

360
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,120
the companies with all the new data

361
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,360
breaches and passwords getting leaked

362
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,279
every day and

363
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,800
i think

364
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
it's become people are becoming more

365
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
aware of it and are starting to listen

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,040
more but

367
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,560
it's still not where it should be

368
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
i mean that's

369
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
that sounds about right for me for

370
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,680
particularly like a lot of small and

371
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,440
medium enterprises

372
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,720
one of the things i will say is actually

373
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,079
i'm going to go and plug one of

374
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,000
yesterday's talks we have greg berkland

375
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
did hack your boss

376
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,279
very good talk and has some relevant

377
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,279
points on this one actually because the

378
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,600
landscape has moved and people are

379
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,079
getting better at things there are less

380
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,800
grumpy guys in it who are multitasking

381
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,440
as security and sat there like oh well

382
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,959
you know what's the point if you're all

383
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,560
just going to break it and i'm blaming

384
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,760
users for everything we think we're

385
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,519
moving on from some of that blame game

386
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,519
that we used to play before

387
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,120
um but we still have this massive

388
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,959
resourcing issue

389
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,240
i can't say the same for my current

390
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,639
company because uh we are kind of like

391
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,160
on top of things i'm much more happy

392
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
there than i was my previous one don't

393
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,160
go looking at my linkedin however i am

394
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,760
going to slate my previous employer for

395
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,399
20 minutes now

396
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,680
no um my previous employer had a couple

397
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
issues with the fact that they didn't

398
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,240
quite size the team correctly

399
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,480
and the budget didn't match

400
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,800
so because there wasn't this kind of

401
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,639
element like greg will talk about how to

402
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,880
get your boss to buy into things because

403
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
we didn't have the buy-in

404
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,800
and a lot of small companies don't have

405
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
that buy-in they're like oh you know why

406
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,079
should i spend 30 000 pounds on and you

407
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,760
know on a sock analyst why should i

408
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,880
spend 40 000 50 000 pounds on people to

409
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,519
like build help build out my team

410
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,959
and

411
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,600
no one knows what they've lost until

412
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,279
they've lost it

413
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,720
so everyone's like oh there's no way you

414
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,240
know we'll lose a bit of data what's the

415
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,079
worst that could happen and then the ico

416
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,279
comes along

417
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,160
and issues one of its very rare fines

418
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,399
for breaching gdpr and you're stuck

419
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,920
there with like

420
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,480
a massive portion of your income just

421
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,040
gone as a fine without all the other

422
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,480
things you had to do to get your data

423
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
back in the first place

424
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,800
so

425
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,000
i think we i think we're moving in the

426
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
right direction

427
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,839
we're very very far from being where we

428
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,040
need to be

429
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,160
particularly with

430
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
smaller companies with smaller workflows

431
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,959
and

432
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,720
kind of more hierarchical structures

433
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,160
sometimes

434
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,519
where the person at the top doesn't

435
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,360
understand the value that's being driven

436
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
by security

437
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,519
because we are always a cost center

438
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,440
rather than we are

439
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,399
rather than being seen as defense and

440
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,800
protection of assets i find

441
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,639
thank you and leading on from that

442
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,480
because there could almost be some

443
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,720
relationship between these questions

444
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,519
uh it's not often that a week goes by

445
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,760
without someone in the security twitter

446
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,399
community burning out and saying i'm

447
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,600
going to quit or quitting or wanting to

448
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720
quit

449
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
even more often if you talk to people in

450
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,160
reality so

451
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
have you come across peers who were

452
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,120
stressed either in industry or during

453
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,839
your course or just

454
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,120
socially and

455
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,959
have you picked up anything on how

456
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,800
people could manage it or whether there

457
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,519
are

458
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,199
ways to manage it or how do you manage

459
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,279
it

460
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,210
i quit for six months

461
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,519
[Laughter]

462
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,279
infosec twitter was getting a little bit

463
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,800
too much for me

464
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,560
a few too many people were having a few

465
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,959
too many spicy takes

466
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,160
so i decided that the uh the extra intel

467
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,680
and the community spirit that was going

468
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,759
on wasn't quite what i wanted i took a

469
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,600
break got my head down did a little bit

470
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
of work

471
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
um

472
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,120
honestly one of the best things you can

473
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,959
do i find personally obviously it's

474
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,720
gonna work different for everyone else

475
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,199
one of the best things i found was just

476
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,920
turning off and resetting

477
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,199
if you get to that point where you're

478
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,639
like oh

479
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,399
i can't deal with this anymore someone

480
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,240
has crossed a line or someone has gone

481
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,320
beyond what they should

482
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,279
just

483
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,880
shut it all down

484
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,720
carry on with your job keep talking to

485
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,079
your co-workers keep talking to your

486
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,519
colleagues

487
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,079
and people that you trust

488
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,680
bring that circle back down to something

489
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
more manageable

490
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,639
and then you can creep out again as time

491
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,160
goes on

492
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,839
i find that that helped me a lot but i'm

493
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,839
not 100 sure if that works for everyone

494
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,880
though

495
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
yeah i agree it's i think it's always

496
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,399
important to take time for yourself as

497
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,639
well because absolutely

498
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,519
where

499
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,959
everything's always changing within

500
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,320
infosec and you're constantly having to

501
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,559
learn and

502
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,760
keep updated i think it can be hard to

503
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,359
make sure that you also keep time to

504
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,039
yourself right and

505
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,720
not just constantly

506
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
be within the community or talking to

507
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,439
people

508
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,119
and constantly learning um but also find

509
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,959
some time to

510
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,280
sit down and relax

511
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,160
yeah

512
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,599
so i think a lot of us are kind of

513
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,919
introverts or ambiverts like at best i

514
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,120
don't think there's a lot of us who are

515
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,679
extroverts who want to go out there and

516
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,600
constantly absorb energy from the

517
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
infosec community in whichever form that

518
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,320
takes

519
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,320
i'm not sure i'd want to deal with

520
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,960
someone who actively wants to absorb

521
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,480
energy from the twitter into a tech

522
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,480
community

523
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,160
there are good places there are

524
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,080
definitely good places and good people

525
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,919
one of the things i find is quite good

526
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,720
as well is branching out beyond your

527
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,280
security bubble

528
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,360
because infosec twitter can be quite

529
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,799
insular and

530
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
it likes to obsess over things that

531
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
perhaps aren't that big an issue or

532
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,960
aren't that big a problem

533
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,039
like we had these and we've had critical

534
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,880
cves that have come out and everyone's

535
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
gone into panic mode because it's like

536
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
oh you know we're all gonna die everyone

537
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
give up all your weekends and afternoons

538
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,600
to make sure that this gets fixed in

539
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,559
time

540
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,520
and

541
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,200
then we've actually looked at it and the

542
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,960
rate of exploitation for those

543
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
vulnerabilities as dangerous as they

544
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,360
might be is effectively zero because

545
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,080
it's only running on devices that are

546
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,600
well behind the dmz

547
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,240
and no one's really thought to take

548
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,080
stock and think about where all of the

549
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,240
threats and all of the big panic of the

550
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
day is hiding because it's a popular

551
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,320
thing and it gets you likes to say

552
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,120
everybody panic

553
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
i think also what you were saying about

554
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
branching out within

555
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
like your infosec bubble it's also good

556
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
for going to like in person conferences

557
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,880
and things

558
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,480
um because it's a really good way to

559
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,160
meet new people that you might not have

560
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
met otherwise

561
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,799
yeah absolutely

562
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,600
on on the infosec bubble i mean we use

563
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,480
the words infosec and cyber security and

564
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,440
security pretty much interchangeably

565
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,640
but i'm interested in whether you've

566
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,200
had any experience or spoken to anyone

567
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
in the security community but outside

568
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,720
the technical security community

569
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,840
so physical security biosecurity food

570
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,240
any of those whether you

571
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,600
actively look to have those

572
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,400
conversations

573
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,080
in breaking out of your bubble or if you

574
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,320
just want to go i want to talk to normal

575
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,480
people not more security people please

576
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,160
know more about risk management

577
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
i get along quite well with a lot of

578
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,559
people in risk management

579
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,799
but that's also because i am

580
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,000
an outlier and i love paperwork

581
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,039
i love documentation and if i could have

582
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,799
been a digital librarian

583
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,880
i would have been a digital librarian i

584
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,679
think

585
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,919
um it's really fun and it's something

586
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,200
that i enjoy personally so i've got a

587
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
personal stake with that and that side

588
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,799
of things i've had a few friends who've

589
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,000
been in physical security as well and

590
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,559
it's just really really helpful

591
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,720
to talk to people and contextualize

592
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,799
things in a way that you don't get from

593
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,360
a pure security view

594
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,520
also always talk to your developers

595
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,039
developers love it when you talk to them

596
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,080
about security

597
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
i think it's always really important to

598
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
spread out and learn about all the

599
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,840
different area of all the other

600
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,760
different areas as well rather than just

601
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,679
staying within

602
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,000
the whatever

603
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,520
job role or whatever it is that you're

604
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,039
in and

605
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,000
if you're

606
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
um only speaking to people within the

607
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
same infosec communities and stuff as

608
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,440
you you're not going to be learning the

609
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,640
stuff from other people as well

610
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,480
i think it's always really interesting

611
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,679
to know what other people are doing

612
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,520
because it can also help you improve on

613
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,039
what you're doing then

614
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,640
yeah absolutely because like if you talk

615
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,440
to um you know security people do a lot

616
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,720
of ctf wow

617
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,320
a lot of security people do a lot of

618
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,480
ctfs it's kind of like a big thing in

619
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,320
the community

620
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,440
but

621
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,120
you do need to talk to people who

622
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,960
understand systems administration you

623
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,559
need to talk to system administrators

624
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,720
you need to talk to people who

625
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,440
run like containerized

626
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
at like containerized assets

627
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
containerized like everything you need

628
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,720
to talk to someone who knows docker you

629
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,000
need to talk to someone who knows how to

630
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,760
run hypervisors

631
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,159
you need to talk to programmers

632
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,720
to get to a point where you can deliver

633
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,080
that kind of thing in the community in

634
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,640
the first place and you learn so much

635
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
from those people who are outside what

636
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,200
you would consider traditional security

637
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,280
just to do real basic things in the

638
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
industry

639
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,600
so

640
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,760
while everyone can go on about patching

641
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,559
and

642
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
the latest cbe on the market yeah you're

643
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,559
absolutely right

644
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,320
it's

645
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,000
super useful

646
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,400
to get that input from people

647
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,679
who have other technical and

648
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,400
non-technical skills

649
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,760
because you know

650
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,080
how to hack your boss isn't

651
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
necessarily something that's a pure

652
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
infosec talk how to hack your boss is

653
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,200
something that could apply to any

654
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,120
workplace any time it's about

655
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,600
stakeholder management

656
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
okay on that because we've now talked

657
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,640
about branching out

658
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,280
the whole specialization versus

659
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,480
generalism or generalist debate

660
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,559
where do you both fall on that and

661
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,360
what's your reason

662
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,720
that one's rough i'll let chloe go

663
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,200
faster now

664
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,400
so do you mean like specialized within

665
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,880
cyber security like a specific

666
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,600
so for example uh

667
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,720
pen testers doing ctfs doing the box

668
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,200
doing try hack me and focusing on those

669
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,799
areas

670
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,120
not to the exclusion of all else but

671
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480
i think it's always good um

672
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,880
to branch out your knowledge because it

673
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,760
means that you'll have more

674
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,799
understanding of what you're doing

675
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,320
and say

676
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,120
if you were doing hack the boxes and all

677
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,039
that other stuff you might actually come

678
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,480
across something where you need to know

679
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,360
the

680
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,960
um

681
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,919
other

682
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,520
say different types of programming or

683
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,559
different

684
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,130
um

685
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,240
[Music]

686
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,559
i don't know different scripting

687
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,559
just so that you know how to use it if

688
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,960
it comes to a point where you do need to

689
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,000
so i think it's always important to look

690
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,400
at the wider picture rather than just

691
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,320
what you specialize in

692
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,480
yeah absolutely because if you um like

693
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,080
for instance if you're in security and

694
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,240
you need to de-obfuscate some code if

695
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,880
you can't read javascript

696
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
you're a bit stuffed

697
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,520
but

698
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,200
you're not going to exclusively be the

699
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,440
security person who reads javascript you

700
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
know some people might you know

701
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,799
drop

702
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,679
powershell might drop bash scripts on a

703
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,840
system and being able to read powershell

704
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,440
being able to read bash being able to do

705
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,880
those system administrator tasks

706
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,120
are really helpful i'm very much like

707
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,880
i'm kind of with you on this one in the

708
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,039
more generalist camp

709
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,640
but that doesn't mean there isn't a

710
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,279
space for specialists because i rely

711
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,159
very heavily on people who have the

712
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,159
specialist knowledge in the field and i

713
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,480
need to know who to go to

714
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,159
so i think

715
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,720
if you if you personally on the other

716
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,799
end of the conference want to do either

717
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,880
feel free because there is a space for

718
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,600
you

719
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
there is a space for specialists and

720
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,120
there is a space for generalists yeah i

721
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,559
think it's just a preference to be

722
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,440
honest

723
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,640
absolutely and i feel like it's kind of

724
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,200
our job as in the more generalist fields

725
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,440
to

726
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,880
bridge

727
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,279
the skills that they don't have

728
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,480
it's like we enable a specialist to do

729
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,120
their bit really really well

730
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
because we can help take care of the

731
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,320
things that they don't understand in a

732
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,640
much more broad sense

733
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,559
and then they enable us to do our jobs

734
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,480
because if i'm like hey i need this

735
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,520
really really in-depth splunk query

736
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,640
that like cross-references three

737
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,159
different sources and has like 17 nested

738
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,679
if statements

739
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,080
then i can ask the guy i know who's used

740
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
splunk all his life for like as long as

741
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,679
splunk's existed

742
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,960
and he'll just pull that report for me

743
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,080
and just hand it over and be like there

744
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,840
you go

745
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,879
and that's super useful

746
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,120
okay and keeping them with the

747
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,600
controversy then

748
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,559
non non-technical roles in security

749
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,919
yes or no

750
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,159
yes

751
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,880
question over done

752
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,600
where do they fit in

753
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,640
i mean

754
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,600
i think

755
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,400
right yeah and also non-technicals can

756
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,000
sometimes be better at communicating

757
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,880
than

758
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,600
um

759
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,520
some technical people so they can also

760
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,360
bridge the gap between the technicals

761
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,200
and the

762
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,799
non-technicals um

763
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,159
because there's usually someone who

764
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,919
works between

765
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,440
both of them

766
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,279
and they can

767
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,840
basically translate the technical

768
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,360
people's

769
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,559
um

770
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,799
gibberish to some people

771
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,960
yeah um and a good example of that

772
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,919
actually

773
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,159
um so i used to work at a company that

774
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,840
had basically no documentation

775
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,600
um and then we decided we were gonna

776
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,440
have some documentation

777
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,360
it was written up by people who were

778
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,240
just a little bit more specialist

779
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,080
in nature um specialist in the

780
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,640
elitist kind of way they were like i'm

781
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,440
going to be in charge of technology and

782
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,120
people are bad and i will never do

783
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,880
people because people are a bit too much

784
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,480
for me

785
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,360
um

786
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,279
which you know is it's if that's how

787
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,880
they work that's how they work it's just

788
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,960
we kind of needed someone to

789
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,559
tie that all in so they would draw up

790
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,559
these big documents that were 25 pages

791
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,440
long

792
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,400
completely incomprehensible defined

793
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
every term with six paragraphs of

794
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,120
technical data

795
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,200
and we kind of had to go in and we had

796
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,080
to rewrite some of that

797
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,200
um

798
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,640
communication is one of the most

799
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
effective like one of the best skills

800
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,600
you can have in security even if you're

801
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,039
a specialist

802
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,480
even if you don't want to deal with

803
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,880
people effective communication skills

804
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,000
are essential because there will be a

805
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,320
time when you need to there'll be a time

806
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,279
when you need to communicate with

807
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,240
someone

808
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
that where there isn't

809
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,399
you know the people person in the

810
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,360
department around

811
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,679
so

812
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,880
yeah

813
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,640
guess some people skills

814
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,399
right i will find something

815
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,320
controversial at some point which will

816
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,760
actually work rather than get an

817
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,840
acceptable answer so

818
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,320
sticking along the same sort of thing

819
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,720
in the uk we've got the dcms doing

820
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,240
consultations at the moment about

821
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,399
professionalising the industry

822
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,159
and you've mentioned elitism already

823
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,919
is there such a thing as good

824
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,320
gatekeeping

825
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,720
and what would it look like if it is or

826
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,640
if it doesn't exist then why not

827
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,520
i might have i might have a spicy take

828
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,279
on this one but um i'll let chloe open

829
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,640
no you're welcome to go first on this

830
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
one

831
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,960
no you

832
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,039
so

833
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,960
there is

834
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,279
a massive

835
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,279
shortage

836
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,360
in the cyber security industry for

837
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,799
professionals

838
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,960
now i believe that shortage is primarily

839
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,840
driven

840
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,399
by gatekeeping

841
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,880
and it's absolutely

842
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,159
dreadful

843
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,440
so we are a in this particular country

844
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,799
at this particular time at this

845
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,559
particular maturity stage for the

846
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,320
majority of businesses

847
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,240
i think there is no such thing as good

848
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,480
gatekeeping

849
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,799
there is you know for security there is

850
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,000
no such thing because you can train

851
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,720
people and people learn on the job i was

852
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,480
very fortunate that i took a leap from

853
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,559
junior to mid

854
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,200
quite early on in my career

855
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,080
and

856
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,399
that leap

857
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,240
was someone throwing me a lifeline

858
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,480
basically they were like you know

859
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,279
you can deal with people so come on and

860
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,600
you know be our people person for a year

861
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,880
i did that

862
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,919
and i learned so much

863
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,679
that you don't get taught

864
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,440
in indus you don't get taught in like

865
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,919
industry approved university programs

866
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,799
you don't get taught in your college you

867
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,480
don't get taught in your secondary

868
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,399
school you don't get taught in the

869
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,000
comptia books

870
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
none of that

871
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,919
helped

872
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,320
in any meaningful sense when i moved

873
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,760
into industry and i started using

874
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,679
industry tools

875
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,200
because

876
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,799
it's a different world

877
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,640
industry and education aren't matched up

878
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,760
right now

879
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
so you can ask for 30 different

880
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,200
certifications

881
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,320
and sure someone who's done those

882
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
certifications might have a solid

883
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,600
understanding

884
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,679
of how to begin to understand those

885
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,600
industry tools

886
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,080
but also someone who's had none but is a

887
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,600
really good learner

888
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,360
can sit in front of those industry tools

889
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,679
and in six months time

890
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,799
they will

891
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,480
accelerate past that person who had

892
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,240
those certifications those you know

893
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,480
those degrees that kind of thing so i

894
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,640
think

895
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,240
we should be

896
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,000
accepting more people

897
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,679
with more diverse backgrounds into the

898
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,200
industry because we need the bodies

899
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,880
but also

900
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,720
because we don't have an education

901
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,520
system fit for purpose and security

902
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,600
and until we have that until we have a

903
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,679
system where we can teach people

904
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,840
good security practice

905
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,679
how to use tools

906
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,519
and how to

907
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,080
run you know how to run your sock how to

908
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,880
run

909
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,039
your application security team how to

910
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,840
run your incident responses

911
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,240
we should be letting juniors in and we

912
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,480
should be training them up

913
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,640
and we should be having reviews like six

914
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,559
months we should be having reviews

915
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,799
yearly and we should be like okay you

916
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,080
were a junior

917
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,519
it doesn't look like it anymore you've

918
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,440
just grasped all of the concepts we've

919
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,880
thrown at you in a really short period

920
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,120
of time

921
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,640
that's my take

922
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,919
also if they've got a more diverse

923
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,440
background they'll have different ways

924
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,279
of thinking so they might find things

925
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,360
that other people wouldn't

926
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,679
yeah i mean if you get an army of red

927
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,279
teamers in the chat

928
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,440
and you have them all talk about how to

929
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,000
get into a box you'll get a very very

930
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,840
different set of responses to having

931
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,000
like a group of blue teamers in the chat

932
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,960
yeah

933
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,840
then

934
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,679
put them together see what happens share

935
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,240
some ideas

936
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,880
okay we've got about 10 minutes left and

937
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,480
skelly's been wanting to ask this one

938
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,720
for a while so

939
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,120
have you been impacted by tokenism and

940
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
forced diversity in tech and what are

941
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,720
your thoughts on it and do you think

942
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,679
it's beneficial or harmful

943
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,320
this will be fun

944
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,039
so um i don't think i've been affected

945
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,919
by tokenization in technology that much

946
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,600
if at all really

947
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,960
um i have had people be incredibly weird

948
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,039
to me

949
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,279
which is less tokenization and more just

950
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,640
the fact that everyone accepts

951
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,200
discrimination in the industry

952
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,559
super common

953
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,320
uh i believe it is a third of employers

954
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,240
in technology

955
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,120
will turn around and say we are going to

956
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,120
break the equality act by um simply

957
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,159
not

958
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,320
hiring people who are

959
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,120
too

960
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,919
diverse for us

961
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:58,880
so

962
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,559
we have a little bit of a problem there

963
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,320
i don't necessarily think we're getting

964
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,080
tokenization

965
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,799
i i don't think we're elevating voices

966
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,880
above where they should be i think what

967
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,200
we're doing is we're reaching a point

968
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,480
where

969
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,799
voices that used to be suppressed

970
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,240
actively

971
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,159
are getting less

972
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,279
so

973
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,519
people are seeing that movement upwards

974
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,399
to an even platform as tokenization i

975
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,639
think

976
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,960
chloe do you wanna

977
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,519
drop in you haven't any experiences like

978
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,720
that i don't know what it's like in

979
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,039
university anymore because i know that

980
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,640
there are a lot of like girls who code

981
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,880
and women inside the things guys yeah

982
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,200
there's a lot of that sort of thing um

983
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,039
and you can get different opportunities

984
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,279
and stuff specifically for women to try

985
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,200
and encourage them to

986
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,399
go into tech

987
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,320
um

988
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,919
but again i think that's also because

989
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,039
there's yeah on my course there's a lot

990
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,159
more guys than girls

991
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,679
so i think they're trying to bridge the

992
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,919
gap between that still at the moment

993
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,399
yeah do you think that i don't know what

994
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
it's like for you as well do you think

995
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,918
that

996
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,159
the problem is that we can't

997
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,239
get people into the industry or do you

998
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,359
think the problem is like whether or not

999
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,599
they stick around like do you find that

1000
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,199
over uni there's a drop-off rate or

1001
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,879
something like that

1002
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,760
um

1003
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,280
i think there's a bit

1004
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
the problem that i have is that i've

1005
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,560
moved university so i wouldn't know

1006
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,079
do i do the same thing

1007
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,079
i did the same thing i hit i hit second

1008
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,359
year and i did my third year at

1009
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,879
different universities yeah that's what

1010
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,839
i've done

1011
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,960
yeah well

1012
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,320
yeah

1013
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,119
close enough yeah

1014
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,239
that is

1015
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,560
i do i do think that part of the problem

1016
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,239
with keeping

1017
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,839
we're going slightly off topic here i

1018
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,918
think part of the problem of keeping

1019
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,520
like wanna say minoritized groups in

1020
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,000
security is a lot of us just

1021
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,800
quit

1022
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,040
because in my last job i had a guy who

1023
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,359
would come up to me and we were remote

1024
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,640
working he would like come into my

1025
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,000
team's chat and he would call me on

1026
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,240
teams and he would start doing the

1027
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,800
absolute weirdest things he would start

1028
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,079
showing me

1029
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,520
comic books that he read which actually

1030
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,359
that's kind of cool right you know

1031
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,960
show me your special interest we can get

1032
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,720
to know each other and be friends the

1033
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,040
problem is he was showing me comics

1034
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,520
about a torture novel

1035
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,359
oh

1036
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,400
and he was just trying to like

1037
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,880
constantly do like the most gross things

1038
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,520
to like freak me out and i'm like

1039
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,760
i'm not rising to this bait but like why

1040
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
are you doing this

1041
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,400
i mean i've had people message me

1042
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,160
inappropriate things

1043
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,079
yeah and that was before i'd even turned

1044
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,599
18 so

1045
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,160
there was a lot of dodgy stuff going on

1046
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,040
but

1047
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,800
i think that's also

1048
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,599
a lot a lot of women in tech or women in

1049
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,720
general

1050
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,839
find that it happens a lot to them i

1051
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,079
think i think because like obviously

1052
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,079
when you're in infosec you have certain

1053
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,320
you know you have usually got like a

1054
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,880
skill set that allows you or enables you

1055
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,760
to do

1056
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,520
bad things if you want to do bad things

1057
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,280
and

1058
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,040
some people take advantage of that maybe

1059
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
not as many as you might think but it's

1060
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,880
enough for it to be a serious like

1061
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,520
annoyance like a thorn in your side when

1062
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,720
you're in the industry and you're

1063
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,079
constantly exposed to people like that

1064
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,160
and i think um

1065
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,920
maybe if more people took a stand

1066
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,200
against them

1067
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,280
rather than you know if people took us

1068
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,760
down against them then after a few years

1069
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,680
when things catch up and the buffer kind

1070
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,800
of

1071
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,680
hits its end we'll start needing

1072
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,160
less and less of this kind of signal

1073
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,320
boosting for uh like keeping us in

1074
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,760
technology

1075
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,440
because

1076
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,280
instead of like advertising for everyone

1077
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,440
like please stay please please stay

1078
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,960
we'll actually have like communities

1079
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,560
where people will want to stay

1080
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,839
i've i have noticed one particular thing

1081
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,480
um just to you know insert my

1082
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,079
underrepresented voice into this

1083
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,440
there's

1084
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
almost a thing in security that i've

1085
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,000
seen come up a lot where people are very

1086
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,079
against demographic surveys as part of

1087
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,280
hiring

1088
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,839
and say that they're being intrusive

1089
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,320
they're privacy violating why do

1090
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,040
companies need this data

1091
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,119
i do think there's a problem there in

1092
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,280
that the reason companies need that data

1093
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,720
is if you don't measure you don't know

1094
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,920
you've got a problem

1095
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,280
if you don't know you've got a problem

1096
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,040
you can't stop looking at solutions for

1097
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,160
that problem

1098
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,599
and nothing gets better so while

1099
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,320
there is a take that it's intrusive that

1100
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,880
seems very much weaponizing security

1101
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,280
concerns to try and stick heads in the

1102
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,520
stand and say there is no problem we

1103
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,240
don't need to do anything wrong

1104
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,119
diversity people just don't want to go

1105
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,480
into tech

1106
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,800
and just to stick my own as i said

1107
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,280
underrepresented taken there as well

1108
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,760
right we've you say it's an under you

1109
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,040
say i was gonna say you say it's an

1110
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,160
underrepresented um view and actually

1111
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,760
you say it kind of ironically i'm not

1112
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,560
sure that it is underrepresented

1113
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,680
um

1114
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,359
although it isn't underrepresented

1115
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,640
rather because

1116
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,240
you're kind of right

1117
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,599
there are

1118
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,280
i will say to anyone who does think that

1119
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,960
if you are watching the chat right now

1120
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,200
just remember that demographic surveys

1121
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,839
are

1122
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,280
optional you can simply choose not to

1123
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,680
reveal that data and like the company

1124
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,520
that wants to use that data for any

1125
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,079
reason do so it's a it you know it's

1126
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,320
your personal data

1127
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,720
you do what you want with that also

1128
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,640
try not to force other people

1129
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,920
yes

1130
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,680
all data if you are giving away

1131
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,599
demographic data obviously you do need

1132
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,440
the legitimate cons like security

1133
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,560
concerns of it being fully anonymized it

1134
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,520
being

1135
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,599
preferably like preferably in such a way

1136
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,200
that you cannot trace it's not like

1137
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,440
pseudonymizing fully anonymize data if

1138
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,400
you can

1139
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,640
always there are legitimate security

1140
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,800
concerns but you can't weave things in

1141
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,119
like well i don't want to give my

1142
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,880
information across because i don't

1143
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,400
believe in

1144
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,040
you know insert your own political take

1145
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,599
on what you think of diversity in the

1146
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,839
workplace

1147
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,839
and that means that no one else should

1148
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,400
it's like you can have your views but

1149
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,640
try not to force that

1150
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
you know try not to force data away from

1151
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,320
people who need it to make a positive

1152
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
change

1153
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,359
right we've got one minute left so final

1154
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,760
hot spicy take from each of you

1155
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,960
certificates yes or no

1156
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,359
i think it depends

1157
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,760
it's more personal preference to be

1158
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,200
honest

1159
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,000
because i know people who have gone into

1160
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,400
info cycle security roles and they've

1161
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,079
had no certificates

1162
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,040
yep

1163
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,560
so

1164
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,640
sometimes it can help be

1165
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,960
a shortcut but it's not necessarily

1166
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,040
needed

1167
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,079
yep

1168
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,040
at risk of um a risk of burning bridges

1169
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,000
um

1170
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,800
ec council please stop

1171
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,720
um

1172
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,520
no a lot of certificates are checkbox

1173
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,880
exercises

1174
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,119
until your certificate stops becoming a

1175
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,760
checkbox checkbox exercise

1176
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,960
no

1177
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,720
there is no need for them

1178
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,480
however

1179
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,560
i will caveat it for the certificate

1180
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,200
holders in the crowd i have a cloud

1181
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,480
practitioner with aws

1182
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,319
those checkbox exercises can actually

1183
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,720
get your foot in the door so

1184
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,800
does it build your skill set

1185
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,560
maybe is it a good place to start maybe

1186
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,119
