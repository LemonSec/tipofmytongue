1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,720
hi everyone daniel here i'm so grateful

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,720
i get to present this and combine two

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,400
topics that i like

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,559
science and cyber security

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
thank you so much digital overdose team

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,199
it's wonderful and helpful this thing

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,600
that you do for rookie speakers i

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,160
remember my first etf do was with

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,720
digital overdose and i remember being

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,800
teammates with denise so i'm really

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,039
thankful that a lot of my cyber security

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,720
first milestones are with digital

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,079
overdose

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,399
shifting careers it felt like foreign

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,600
territory being in the chemistry lab in

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
my undergrad days it felt like there

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,680
isn't much about cyber security that

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,800
would resonate or overlap with where i

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,320
came from

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
but in my journey as a beginner or as i

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,719
would probably say

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,120
a script kitty which is new to all of

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,760
these the overlap between those two

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
fields has been

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,640
really fascinating to discover

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
but before my presentation just a quick

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,760
introduction i'm daniel erkhon i'm a

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,400
christian from the philippines i majored

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
in biochemistry but i'm also

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
an enthusiast of cyber security

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,080
i really enjoy these shows some of them

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
make me wonder some of them make me

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,880
curious some of them make me laugh

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,280
and there's a chance you'd find some of

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,580
them

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,040
[Music]

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,520
among the slides

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,520
and yeah that's a short introduction

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,400
about me and with this cue from dr matt

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,439
jamie

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,479
let's jump to the main part

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,119
her presentation really is inspired by

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,079
biomimicry that is to save the emulation

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,600
of examples from nature environment and

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,759
basically the natural world

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,960
to solve complex human problems

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,759
we've seen humans take notes from nature

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,680
and copied solutions for our

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
architecture

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
fashion and biomedical engineering

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,759
velcro is among such examples mosquitoes

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,320
were also studied in research as models

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,360
for an effective needle in medicine

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
but there are a couple more examples in

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,560
the industry where commercial problems

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,480
are solved by mimicking nature

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,920
like

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,239
a new batch of solar cells have taken an

59
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,480
inspiration from plants

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,959
the solar cells mimic a mechanism used

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,280
by plants to generate energy

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
through photosynthesis so the dye

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,599
sensitized solar cells or dsscs contain

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,920
a porous layer of titanium dioxide

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,400
nanoparticles covered in the dye

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
and that absorbs incoming photons from

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
the sun just like the way plants absorb

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,360
light for photosynthesis

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,000
and these solar cells are generally

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,239
considered much more environmentally

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,280
benign to produce than traditional solar

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
cells because they use relatively

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,319
non-toxic materials that require only

74
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,800
little energy to manufacture

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,879
they're also able to produce the same

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
amount of energy as a silicon-based

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,280
solar cell while reducing their life

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,879
cycle environmental impact

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,319
and another example of biomimiky is for

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,560
their products harnessing the example of

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
coral reefs to sell eco-friendly

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
concrete

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,599
so the process of making salmon one of

84
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,720
the main ingredients for concrete

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,760
it's responsible for about six percent

86
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,040
of all man-made carbon dioxide emissions

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,959
so those gases absorbing solar energy

88
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
and they keep heat close to the earth

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,200
that's known as the greenhouse effect

90
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,560
and that leads to global warming

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,200
so this company fourth area

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,640
they mimic the formation of coral reefs

93
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,120
by using carbon dioxide emissions from

94
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,200
power plants which is then channeled in

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,000
salt water also waste and the product

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
that is formed is used as cement and

97
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,959
other similar products basically the

98
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,439
solution they contribute is that rather

99
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,200
than releasing

100
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,439
carbon dioxide with the production of

101
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,879
cement

102
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,360
they use it instead as an ingredient

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,519
they claim that for every one ton of

104
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,918
salmon they produce they remove one ton

105
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,880
of carbon dioxide that would have ended

106
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,840
in the atmosphere

107
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,160
and another example is that king fisher

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
inspired the shinkansen bullet train in

109
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,199
japan

110
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
the engineers looked to nature to

111
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,440
redesign the bullet chain so they

112
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,320
noticed how

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,880
the kingfisher birds are able to slice

114
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
through the air and dive into the water

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,840
to catch spray while barely making a

116
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,320
splash they then redesigned the front

117
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,000
end of the chain to mimic the shape of

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,759
the kingfisher's beak

119
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,759
and not only did this help to reduce

120
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,560
noise and eliminate tunnel booms it also

121
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
allows the train to travel 10 percent

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,039
faster using only 15 using 15 less

123
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,919
electricity

124
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,639
and there we've seen a few examples

125
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,199
about engineers and scientists copy some

126
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,600
notes from nature but what about in

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
cybersecurity when defense is a topic in

128
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,160
cybersecurity how is that similar by the

129
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,320
body's own line of defense the immune

130
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,520
system

131
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,240
as it turns out the steps of incident

132
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
response

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
in cyber security has some stuff in

134
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,560
common with their own anatomy's immune

135
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,840
response

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,080
when we are faced with a pathogen or an

137
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,520
invader

138
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,680
so simply put we can simplify the

139
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,400
immune response with this

140
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,960
four bullet points prevent

141
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,120
recognize counter

142
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,280
and then we recover and recall

143
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,120
when we say prevent

144
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,039
those are the protective measures we

145
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,840
have ready in place

146
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
to block and attack

147
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
physically we have these barriers like

148
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,479
our skin

149
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,560
and membranes to make a boundary between

150
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
external and internal environment

151
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,240
are saliva itself as antibodies

152
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,400
and with their tonsils location they can

153
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
stop germs entering the body through the

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,039
mouth or the nose

155
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,880
and of course we have several measures

156
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
as our lines of defense in place

157
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,319
to strengthen our own cyber security

158
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,720
posture

159
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,000
but

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,319
when that is bypassed

161
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,720
when our gates are breached when we need

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,319
someone to flag that we have been

163
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,280
adapted

164
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,919
despite the barriers pathogens may enter

165
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,840
the body through skin abrasions or

166
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,680
punctures

167
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,000
or by collecting on mucosal surfaces in

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,520
large numbers

169
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,080
we need someone to alert us about the

170
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
danger and despite the strength we think

171
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,360
we have in our cyber security policies

172
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,199
there might be a back door we do not

173
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,720
expect inside the body we detect protein

174
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
molecule signatures

175
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,440
of the invader and that distinguishes

176
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,319
them

177
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,720
as attackers

178
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
these are our markers because their

179
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,360
signature

180
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
differs from those on the whole on the

181
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,960
host cells

182
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,680
from our own

183
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
and that isn't

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,599
too different as well with us detecting

185
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,160
signatures with malware or malicious

186
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,639
files

187
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,400
so when that's done

188
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
once you already recognize that there is

189
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
an attack

190
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,479
beyond just detection we react

191
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,560
now depending on your incident response

192
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,160
plan your act doesn't get it on the

193
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
context you can isolate the server you

194
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,039
adjust routing policies or delete

195
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,440
monitors software or artifacts that were

196
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,360
left you get rid of it

197
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,000
and as for the body our cells ingests

198
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
the enemy

199
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
and kills that

200
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,560
kind of the way we see

201
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,440
phagocytosis taking place here

202
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,759
and here

203
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,560
but it's not just important that we

204
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,120
recognize and then we reap we should

205
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
also prevent the same invaders from

206
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,680
causing huge damage again

207
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
our body learns from those and adapts we

208
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,400
classify that as our adaptive immunity

209
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,120
we have memory lymphocytes and they

210
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,599
react faster when an attack repeats

211
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,760
because they've also encountered in the

212
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,919
past who they're dealing with

213
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,039
we also learn from events so detach

214
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,880
machine learning is also frequently

215
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,360
mentioned as a helpful solution

216
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
you and his colleagues suggest parallel

217
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,399
adversarial network

218
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,800
they propose they propose a pan the

219
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
parallel adversarial network that

220
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,240
accompanies the operation network

221
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,519
because that would share the same

222
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,160
physical network resources by using

223
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
network slicing techniques

224
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,680
and in the pan

225
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,279
they can proactively introduce

226
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
controllable attack and viruses

227
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,839
they can also use machine learning

228
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,839
methods to make attack and viruses

229
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,480
mutate automatically

230
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
and by doing that it is possible to

231
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,640
observe identify evaluate and assess

232
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,480
network vulnerability

233
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,959
so ultimately they can produce network

234
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,399
quote unquote

235
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,560
vaccines for defense similar to vaccines

236
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,760
in the immune system

237
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,160
and during times of povid

238
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,800
we also hear about herd immunity being

239
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
mentioned quite often in terms of

240
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,480
vaccination and the gist basically is

241
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,200
to use the influence of quantity to

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,279
minimize their risk of the disease on

243
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,880
vulnerable groups

244
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,959
so when there are more individuals with

245
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,160
immunity

246
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,800
this indirectly protects other at-risk

247
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,519
individuals within the vicinity too

248
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,880
and the same goes with cyber security

249
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
cyber attacks demonstrate especially

250
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,399
with supply chain attacks that

251
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,920
businesses

252
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,519
are connected

253
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,920
cyber risk is not just a them problem

254
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,480
it's a we problem no matter how strong

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,200
we think we are the recent strain of

256
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
high-profile ransomware incidents have

257
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,160
taught us that even the most astute

258
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
analysts

259
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,200
hunters or best-in-class technologists

260
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,959
cannot fully protect networks alone

261
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,440
defending alone isn't enough anymore

262
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
it's vital for organizations

263
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,240
to act proactively to better position

264
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,800
themselves for staying ahead of cyber

265
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,959
attacks and that starts

266
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,480
by investing in the right network

267
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,040
detection response solutions and joining

268
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,320
forces

269
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,959
with industry peers especially fellow

270
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,279
targets of the same attacker to improve

271
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,640
the clarity of the threat landscape

272
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,680
we have seen the rise of numbers in

273
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
cyber attack during the pandemic and

274
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,959
perhaps

275
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,800
just like those engineers and those

276
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
scientists we can copy some of nature's

277
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
notes too

278
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,160
because we are profoundly connected such

279
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,959
that we are most protected when we also

280
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,000
protect others

281
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
so the reason i wanted to talk about the

282
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,880
intersection of immunity and cyber

283
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,600
security isn't just because the guy

284
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,480
playing mr robot would apparently

285
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,240
make a convincing doctor

286
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
not because i wanted to talk

287
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,240
about the obvious

288
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
because none of this is novel

289
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,959
information machine learning cooperation

290
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
among industry experts and different

291
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,440
adversarial networks are already known

292
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,160
and

293
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,720
those are not new concepts some of those

294
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
you probably already know much matter

295
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,440
much better than i do

296
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,600
but i wanted to talk about

297
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,240
the overlap in the fields of science and

298
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,800
cyber security because despite the

299
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
polarizing opinions or big differences

300
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,240
we might have we still have more common

301
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,760
that we think

302
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,480
or notice

303
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,959
we're used to the word

304
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,160
network

305
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
but i hope we never get numb to the

306
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,720
beauty of that word in nature

307
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,639
our ecosystem

308
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,760
is an intricate beautiful network that

309
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,440
helps sustain our survival where even a

310
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,120
small insect can affect the food chain

311
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,600
that affects animals greater than a

312
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,480
hundred times its own size

313
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,760
networks in our own body in our own mind

314
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,920
that look even better than science

315
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,120
fiction

316
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,279
and of course the human network

317
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,639
the human network where some would say

318
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,440
many cyber security errors come from

319
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,920
the human element of breaches others

320
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
would like to call it

321
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
but nevertheless the same

322
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,279
human element that uses machines

323
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,120
as a transformative instrument to

324
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
connect

325
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,639
empower one another

326
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,440
and as this digital overdose event would

327
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,480
show it links people no matter how

328
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,440
different

329
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,600
from across the globe in

330
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,720
varying time zones you and i to talk

331
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
about shared passions

332
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
and what we have in common

333
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
thank you so much everyone thank you i

334
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,680
really appreciate the fortune talk about

335
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,959
this thank you thank you
