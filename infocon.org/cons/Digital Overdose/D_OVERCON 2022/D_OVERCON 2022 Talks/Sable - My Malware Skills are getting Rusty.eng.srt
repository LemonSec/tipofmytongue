00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,319
hi my name is sable and uh welcome to my

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,600
presentation

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,519
um

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,679
the presentation is as you might have

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,360
gathered from the title called my

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,280
malware skills are getting rusty

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,439
[Music]

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
if there was no description or it just

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
hasn't been posted or maybe you didn't

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,039
see it

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,160
this presentation is going to be about

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,359
the use of the rust programming language

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,239
in terms of malware

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,239
basically has it been used how would you

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,840
use it and why might you use it

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,239
[Music]

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,960
thanks for being patient it is my

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,440
first talk and i did have to pre-record

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,039
this because

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,719
i wasn't able to

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,640
make it to any of the talks

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,440
i just want to make it clear before i

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,680
start i don't condone actually

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,520
making viruses for any reason other than

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,840
learning nor should you ever use them on

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,120
anyone

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,040
if you make any use them on yourselves

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
in a controlled environment

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,600
and yeah

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,200
sounds cheesy without further ado let's

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,840
get into the presentation

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,560
uh so what is rust um

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,479
for starters it's

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,759
not the game

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,600
although that is a cool game that i'm

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,920
sure some of you are

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,960
a little too familiar with

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,119
we're not talking about the game

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,200
we are actually going to talk about the

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
rust programming language

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,400
you may have heard of it before

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,119
it's gaining popularity and in stack

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,320
overflow surveys it was being rated as

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,880
one of the most loved languages

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,479
um

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,640
and it's what people want to rewrite

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,479
parts of the linux kernel in

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,680
so

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,399
we'll move on to exactly what it is

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
it's a memory safe programming language

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,079
there's a little thing on the side so

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,360
you can get a little bit i'll show you a

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,880
little bit more later

54
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,640
it's a memory safe programming language

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
that when compiled produces a small

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,759
binary size

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,878
and yes it's compiled and it runs on

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,120
native code so you're not using

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,879
something like the jre to run byte code

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,200
it has speed that rivals c or c plus

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,239
plus

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,599
for the following reasons because it

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,959
uses llvm under the hood

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,400
and llvm stands for low level virtual

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
machine

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,360
the compiler is very aggressive

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,920
it performs aggressive optimizations and

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,959
can get even more aggressive when you

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,480
allow it to

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,879
and it is very strict with what it

71
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,980
allows

72
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,680
[Music]

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,519
it doesn't even let you

74
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,760
use certain naming conventions unless

75
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,319
you disable those warnings

76
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,400
the compiler also works with custom

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,920
linker scripts

78
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,959
and any llvm target that there is

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,760
and llvm is obviously like i said

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,239
earlier low level virtual machine and it

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,239
provides an intermediate representation

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,920
which i'll show you in a bit

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,440
of

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,360
what code is so that it can be compiled

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,800
to any platform

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,480
you may guess what that will be used for

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,840
we'll talk about that later

88
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,120
um but what does some rest code actually

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,560
look like

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
right now i'm just showing you

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
some of my own rust code

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,280
it's nothing too big nothing too

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
important but it does demonstrate some

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,360
of the interesting syntax that rust may

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,879
have

96
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
it has things called macros which you

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,200
can imagine as macros in c plus or

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,920
macros and c

99
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,840
it has interesting syntax as you can see

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
with the pub crate on the function get

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,799
banner

102
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,760
and you may see a lot of dollar signs a

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,799
lot of exclamation points and

104
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,439
normally in rust code you'll probably

105
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,959
see a lot of

106
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,040
colons as well

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,920
but you don't see them as much here

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,519
pretty simple language once you get used

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,799
to it but

110
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
it is rather complex and daunting for

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
beginners with a steep learning curve

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,319
how can this

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,200
actually relate to malware that's a good

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,320
question

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
um

116
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,358
currently

117
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,840
most malware is being written in c or c

118
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,280
plus plus

119
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
very popular languages c is what makes

120
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,479
up

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,560
the linux kernel and c plus plus is what

122
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,680
makes up

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
a large portion of other kernels in a

124
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
lot of applications

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,479
where people worry about binary size

126
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,800
or embedded applications

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,479
where they have limits on a lot of

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,240
things

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,800
rust has a low overhead because it's not

130
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,360
a garbage collected language um but

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
you're also not managing memory yourself

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,440
it's ownership based

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,880
which long story short means each

134
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,320
variable has an owner

135
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,199
yada yada yada that can't be breached

136
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,960
except for certain ideas anyways

137
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,360
um it's unique compared to most

138
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,880
languages and allows you to write

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,759
complex codes safely and easily and it

140
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,759
can get very low level

141
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,280
um

142
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
and if you need to get any more low

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
level than it already can which you

144
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,080
shouldn't have to

145
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,320
you can use something called unsafe and

146
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,720
you can even use inline assembly just

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,039
like in c or c plus

148
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,120
although that does obviously expose your

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
program to being

150
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,960
unsafe um

151
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,240
rust utilizes llvm like i said earlier

152
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
meaning it can easily be cross compiled

153
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,280
to any llvm target that has been adapted

154
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
by the rust team

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
which is why rust is being currently

156
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
used in some embedded projects as it can

157
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,280
go to any x86 64 platform x86 platform

158
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
you can go to arm it can even go to the

159
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
new apple

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
m1

161
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,000
it can go to a lot of things

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,319
it's also memory safe

163
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,120
and can help avoid common bugs

164
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,199
that strain common programmers

165
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,039
can also make things a little bit easier

166
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,639
program when you're avoiding those bugs

167
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,600
making it faster

168
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,919
why would i want to use

169
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,720
rust

170
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,859
[Music]

171
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,840
well

172
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,840
when you use the rust it'll change the

173
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,720
signatures um because it's

174
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,919
different

175
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,120
obviously i mean it's going to change

176
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
the signal because it's not the same

177
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
so it the signature isn't going to be in

178
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,440
the antivirus database or whatever

179
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,800
they're using to recognize it

180
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,080
it can also make your virus more secure

181
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
in terms of like

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,599
you're not going to find any paths

183
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,759
laying around in the executable those

184
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,680
will be stripped you can make your

185
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,400
strings not be built into the executable

186
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,400
so you can't just grip an executable

187
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
it can also speed up the production of

188
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,479
viruses with it being right once and

189
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,319
then just compile to any platform you

190
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,520
want

191
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,599
um

192
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,560
and it can pretty easily make your virus

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,599
cross platform with uh

194
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
layers of abstraction with no real

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,800
sacrifice and speed or binary size

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
although there have been a few issues

197
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,240
with embedded development but usually

198
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
that's not a huge concern for virus

199
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
developers unless for some reason

200
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,360
they're targeting

201
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,120
embedded systems maybe cars

202
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
i'm just showing you a little bit of

203
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
what this looks like on the left you

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,879
will see the intermediate representation

205
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,000
on the right

206
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,199
you'll see a hex editor and yes i know

207
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,160
it's

208
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,199
a png that it's disassembling just bear

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,599
with me i couldn't find a clean photo

210
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,000
of rust and

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,599
i didn't have rust on my device when i

212
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,000
made this

213
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,720
but you can see that

214
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,840
everything

215
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,400
is

216
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,840
looks a little bit

217
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,680
like slightly more complex java byte

218
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
code but

219
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,000
it's not very

220
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,759
machine dependent um

221
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,520
and then the triple is what tells the

222
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,960
compiler

223
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
after the ir

224
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,479
on what to target so that means if you

225
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,640
save the ir you can recompile it to

226
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,000
anything you want

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,479
very nice and then on the right

228
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,080
you'll see what hex code would look like

229
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,839
it would look pretty similar to that

230
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,919
probably with less zeros and you might

231
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,919
see some more strings

232
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,800
in the png i mean in the program instead

233
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,279
of the png

234
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,120
overall not a huge difference

235
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
but so what what does this actually mean

236
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,240
um

237
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,160
well so a lot of people it probably

238
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
means almost nothing

239
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
um

240
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
but

241
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
for those that well it does obviously

242
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,560
mean something it means that the viruses

243
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,680
can go

244
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
cross-platform

245
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,200
very easily which can possibly cause a

246
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
lot more destruction

247
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
[Music]

248
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
but the other big thing is that it can

249
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,279
also speed up virus production virus

250
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,399
production

251
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,440
as people aren't

252
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,200
going to

253
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,839
have to write it multiple times

254
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,120
because of platform dependent code or at

255
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,560
least it isn't going to have to be as

256
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
bulky you aren't going to have to

257
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,560
rewrite the same thing three different

258
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,920
times to target linux mac and windows

259
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,839
you write it once and rust takes care of

260
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,839
it

261
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,200
big issue is that it makes virus

262
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
production much more approachable for

263
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,399
beginners

264
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,360
um

265
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,600
almost as approachable as those little

266
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,360
batch scripts that you might see on

267
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,519
windows where they're like haha prank

268
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,839
your friends

269
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,920
which is an issue because when you give

270
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
beginners

271
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
a lot of power with ease of use

272
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
they can pretty easily turn

273
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,959
pretty destructive

274
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
and that's not good to leave that much

275
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,200
power in beginners hands

276
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
thankfully rust has already patched

277
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,279
most of its issues with opening

278
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,120
protected files without actually

279
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,880
escalating your privileges

280
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,399
although it has been proven to not be

281
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,920
super difficult to escalate your

282
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,079
privileges via

283
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,680
rust programs

284
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,399
and rust is even actually somewhat good

285
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,200
at self modifying programs so

286
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
that's another creative issue you could

287
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,959
have

288
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,320
virus creators can also get more

289
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,600
creative like i said with a self

290
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
modifying program

291
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,600
with the same level of flexibility as c

292
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
or c plus plus

293
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,839
while being easier to develop and not

294
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,839
spending nearly as much time having to

295
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,800
learn

296
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,279
the ins and outs of every little bit of

297
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,560
the compiler in the language

298
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,320
so

299
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,240
big deal

300
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,079
but not necessarily the worst thing in

301
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,479
the world

302
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
but why would we actually want to choose

303
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
rust i mean like i mean there are a

304
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,760
couple other languages like some of the

305
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,279
ones that i picked out off the top of my

306
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,200
head for this are golang

307
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
nim you might have not heard of that one

308
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,279
or d lang also a little bit smaller

309
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,120
um

310
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,800
i mean some people might just choose

311
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,279
rust because they like the package

312
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,320
manager

313
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
uh that come cargo namely which allows

314
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
you to install a lot of packages they're

315
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,279
called crates very easily just cargo

316
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,240
install

317
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
or even just put it in your uh

318
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
manifest file

319
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,000
which is called cargo.tamal

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,839
and it'll automatically download this

321
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,079
great so you build it

322
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,160
and it has a nice project structure

323
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,680
already laid out for you every time you

324
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,959
start it you might just like that uh

325
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,399
or it should be totally honest you might

326
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,240
be like me and you just like the rust

327
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,920
syntax better than d lang nem or golang

328
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
because i mean they're all cool but i

329
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,600
just personally like how explicit it is

330
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,279
with uh rust

331
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,600
um

332
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,560
i mean some people simply don't really

333
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,120
like golang or d-lang it's not a huge

334
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
deal um

335
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,600
it might just not be your language um

336
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,959
even though both could be compiled

337
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,519
across platform very easily

338
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
you might also not want to use nem since

339
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,279
instead of really compiling it more

340
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,279
transpiles down to c or c plus plus

341
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,440
so

342
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,399
if you're unlucky your virus might end

343
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,720
up looking too similar to a previous

344
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,040
virus and get detected

345
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
almost immediately

346
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,040
which would not be very good for a virus

347
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,399
builder now would it

348
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,680
um

349
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,120
although it is convenient because since

350
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,639
it transpiles down you can change it to

351
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,320
whatever you want

352
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
which you can't really do as much with

353
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,360
golang or rust because editing the ir is

354
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,600
a little bit of a nightmare

355
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
personal experience

356
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,920
um

357
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,720
so

358
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
do we actually have any examples of this

359
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,880
and yes we do um we have a few uh i

360
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,279
picked out my two personal favorites

361
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,040
because they're a little bit cool

362
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,320
um

363
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,800
in the past there was a virus called

364
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
viewer b-u-e-r

365
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
and it was basically spread through

366
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,279
emails and would take hold of people's

367
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,399
computers taking sensitive information

368
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,760
and it would always go through word

369
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,440
documents or excel spreadsheets or

370
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,360
whatever um

371
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,120
but eventually was caught and basically

372
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,360
made obsolete because

373
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
well you know

374
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,519
it was known everyone could deal with it

375
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,600
but recently i mean not that recently as

376
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
of now but when i made this recently

377
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,839
there was

378
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,079
a new variant that came out called rusty

379
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,199
viewer

380
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,519
which was essentially viewer but

381
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,320
rewritten in rust with a few small

382
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,560
changes that didn't

383
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
change it overall

384
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
if you couldn't tell by the link on

385
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
screen it was discovered by proof point

386
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,360
we're going to open it and

387
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,399
you can see that it's a new variant

388
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,360
key findings rust

389
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,160
malware can better evade

390
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,240
um it was delivering cobalt strike

391
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,440
beacon

392
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,360
access as a service

393
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,000
they would just sell access

394
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,560
we'll see all these photos later malware

395
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,880
analysis of how it actually works

396
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,560
you can see your rust dependencies and

397
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,040
everything

398
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,880
this is what the bytecode would look

399
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,240
like when you actually opened it

400
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,199
so

401
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,720
this is what the virtual

402
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
it even has its own virtual machine

403
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,399
checks it's got a whole host of things

404
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,360
that are

405
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,199
very impressive but because it was

406
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,680
rewritten in rust it wasn't neces it

407
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,199
wasn't caught as it was in

408
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,479
c um

409
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,320
so going back

410
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,519
these are the photos that we skipped

411
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,360
over earlier this is how it's going to

412
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,519
be delivered to someone it'll be sent

413
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,279
into email

414
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,240
in this case it was delivered by

415
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,959
dhl parcel

416
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,560
or supposedly

417
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,240
and it was an excel spreadsheet although

418
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
you'll see it masquerades itself as a

419
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,360
word document

420
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,920
and it's just got some basic info

421
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,519
saying you don't have to call blah blah

422
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,560
blah

423
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,160
supporting your needs just trying to

424
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,079
bait people into opening the file or

425
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,399
downloading the file

426
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,959
because when you move on you'll see that

427
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,160
it says

428
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,639
it's a secure document it's a protected

429
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,759
document

430
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,199
and

431
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,199
there's no previewing online protected

432
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,639
documents

433
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,880
you have to download them and click

434
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,480
enable editing from the yellow bar above

435
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,079
a little bit tricky hopefully people

436
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,160
would see past this but unfortunately

437
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,040
not everyone does

438
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,880
but of course it's not the only example

439
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,600
we have a few other examples

440
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,959
we have

441
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,479
black cat which uh

442
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,399
on forums they're going by alfv a lphv

443
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,639
they're following the revo model of

444
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
offering ransomware as a service

445
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,680
and black cat was actually the first to

446
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,160
deploy viruses made with rust

447
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,040
in a professional cyber crime cartel

448
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,600
you can see this with this slightly

449
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,160
sketchy link but has nice information on

450
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,319
it

451
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,399
you can see that they're on forums they

452
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,399
have cheesy wording but

453
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,160
you can see that it's slowly moving to

454
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,839
rest and there's a whole lot going on

455
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,279
and you can see that this is the site

456
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,120
that people went to it's got a whole

457
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
host of things telling you what to do

458
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,040
and what they're doing

459
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,600
it is ransomware so

460
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,880
people do

461
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,680
have issues with it

462
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,880
when we move on to what it actually

463
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
looks like this is what it looks like on

464
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
the forums they're saying that they need

465
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,319
experienced pen testers

466
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,720
they're bragging about how people have

467
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
not seen

468
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,319
such a level of

469
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,240
creation before

470
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,439
and if they want to find out all the

471
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,319
details they need to contact below as

472
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,520
you can see it was written by alve

473
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,760
online and with the activity namely

474
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,840
being virology and malware

475
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,760
and they're looking for search

476
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,360
this is what the file will look like

477
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,960
once they

478
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
steal all your data this is how they're

479
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
going to ransom you

480
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,160
you'll see it's pretty generic

481
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,960
but it has worked and obviously

482
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,280
they have their own tour links so

483
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,640
you never know

484
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,559
you got to be careful because it's

485
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,480
becoming more common even in

486
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,280
professional use

487
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,520
so is the malware world

488
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
actually going to move to russ are these

489
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,000
guys just kind of the exception

490
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,799
personally i would say absolutely

491
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
i wholeheartedly believe that the

492
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,200
malware world is going to move to rest

493
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,039
um the speed at which it's moving to

494
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,360
rust is

495
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,679
a little bit slower than most people

496
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,080
would imagine

497
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,960
but

498
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,360
it's definitely moving

499
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,840
and we're seeing it

500
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,159
um

501
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
so now that we've getting over the basic

502
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
parts um we want to go over story time

503
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
right because what's a presentation

504
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,799
without a few stories i'm going over my

505
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,720
experience with rust how i would use it

506
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,360
and how i've applied it in areas that

507
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,520
could be applicable to virus making if i

508
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,000
really wanted to

509
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,760
my personal experience with rust um

510
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,080
personally i love it um it's very

511
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,360
explicit

512
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,440
it's a language where i write once and

513
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,520
run it anywhere which is why

514
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,320
for my own little project which

515
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,960
i'm ironically abandoning in favor of c

516
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,679
plus um which was making a game engine i

517
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,760
chose it very easy to cross compile can

518
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,160
go to anything

519
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,440
but sometimes the rest is a little too

520
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,200
explicit like for a game engine

521
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,200
if we want to talk about how i might use

522
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
rust to make a virus

523
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,640
its file system abstraction is very nice

524
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
very calm

525
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,520
so

526
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,200
i would probably use it to access files

527
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,960
and you can work with the files very

528
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
easily

529
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,840
it also has a good interface

530
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,600
to actually work

531
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,320
with operating system specifics

532
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,240
so with a few directives and using some

533
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,640
nice little blocking in my code

534
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
i can

535
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
even

536
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,760
interact directly with the operating

537
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,520
system to escalate my privileges for

538
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080
each operating system in a unique way

539
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
and if one fails you can even make it do

540
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,679
it another way

541
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,240
very easily

542
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,360
but enough of me just talking about how

543
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,919
i might have done this or how i would or

544
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,440
i have

545
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,000
however i applied rust in a way where i

546
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
can say that

547
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,240
i personally can confirm it could be

548
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,640
applicable to virus making

549
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,799
so

550
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
if you check my github which would be in

551
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,159
my speaker card you'll see it's

552
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,000
cluttered with a whole mess

553
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,840
but if you look for something called os

554
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,919
dev tutoring you will see the beginnings

555
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,919
of a little kernel that i never updated

556
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,880
but

557
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,520
i have made a slightly small working

558
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,679
kernel in rust

559
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,320
um it's pretty mediocre basically just

560
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,520
boots but the point is that you can

561
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,440
directly manage memory and you can get

562
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,360
extremely low level

563
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
and you can even work without the need

564
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,440
for an operating system

565
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,080
it's no std is very good which means it

566
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,840
works for embedded systems um

567
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,600
i also have never pushed them to github

568
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,960
because they are a horrendous mess of

569
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,440
code but i have

570
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,760
attempted to change some of the linux

571
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,240
kernel modules into rust following after

572
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,000
the footsteps of some other very smart

573
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,280
programmers

574
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,039
i never made it but a few people have so

575
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,280
the point is that it can easily be

576
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,760
applied to linux meaning

577
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,400
some sensitive systems do run on linux

578
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,559
and can be targeted by rust very easily

579
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,039
but that is just one of the issues that

580
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,200
i've run across and something that i can

581
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,520
prove

582
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,640
now that we have a few closing thoughts

583
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,760
i'll just go over them i do think that

584
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,080
everyone should learn

585
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,400
a little bit of rust

586
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,640
there's no need to be an expert

587
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,440
because i doubt anyone is going to well

588
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,600
i doubt most people are going to need to

589
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
be an expert unless maybe you're using

590
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,480
it for your job

591
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,360
but

592
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,039
you should be aware of what might be

593
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,720
coming

594
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,640
it might become a common language or it

595
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,360
might become common at least for virus

596
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,760
making just like c and c plus plus kind

597
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,559
of took off for virus making

598
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,080
although it might also die and just

599
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
become a language like ada which most

600
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,799
people have never heard of

601
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,640
even though its use in professional

602
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,559
environments is happening slower than

603
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,159
say the adoption of java or c plus

604
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,880
it is clearly being adopted

605
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,039
some of the companies that used rust in

606
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,240
production

607
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
include dropbox

608
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,360
yeah

609
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,039
coursera

610
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,559
figma npm yeah the package manager

611
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,039
um they even brag about it on the rest

612
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,640
site how npm uses it um microsoft

613
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,480
cloudflare yeah

614
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,280

amazon

619
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,600
and even discord which is what this con

620
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,840
is being planned on a very convenient

621
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,200
little site

622
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,799
um

623
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,280

slightly informative or

647
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,720
[Music]

648
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,480
slightly helpful or even just amusing to

649
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,320
listen to

650
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,200
ciao
