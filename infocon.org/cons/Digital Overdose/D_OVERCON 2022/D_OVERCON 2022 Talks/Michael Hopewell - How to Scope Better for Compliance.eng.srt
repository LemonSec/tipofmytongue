1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,799
thank nicos hope everyone is having a

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,640
fantastic day today

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,839
so

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,120
what we're going to be talking about is

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,360
how we can get better security and how

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,080
we can get better at compliance and i've

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,079
been a security assessor for a very long

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,119
time now and i kind of specialized in

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,400
credit card debit card security uh

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,119
mostly pci dss a pci's payment card

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,439
industry but also i've been doing um

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,000
other security standards like cis the

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,238
top 18 and isf

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,399
standard of good practice so really all

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,760
the principles i've gained from this

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,680
time have learned from mostly the pci

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
space and all the security assessments

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,600
but what i found is that when doing the

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,680
kind of security assessments

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,480
these principles also apply to any kind

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,559
of business and i find that most

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,480
businesses i've actually gone through or

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,800
have helped and

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,399
helped them look at the way they've

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,520
structured their business and their

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,800
information

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280
they just don't get this one step right

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
and that means it can lead to some

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,000
serious big holes

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,360
so i'm going to go through this quite

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,119
quickly so i can give as much value as

32
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,080
possible so let's dive right in so let's

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
give us a bit of context right now

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,320
you know in reality

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,000
most organizations um focus on sales

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,119
marketing

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,479
and of course delivery they're here to

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,880
make the profit reduce the cost and

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,560
optimize

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
the survival of the business but where

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
are you right now

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,640
so maybe you're a new a new business or

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
new to security you're a growing

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,640
business you're in your early years of

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,400
survival and you need to know you need

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,079
to do security

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,720
you don't know where to begin or who to

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,479
believe

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,799
well you've had to go to security

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,960
not so sure how it applies to your

51
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,759
business not so sure if your policies or

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,119
procedures are effective

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,200
or maybe you do have some compliance

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,320
overhead

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,759
and you know that you're not meeting

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,759
those obligations right now and those

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,719
deadlines are coming up

58
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,399
or you have been bridged

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,960
data theft or other you don't know how

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,280
it occurred i'm not starting to worry

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,959
right now because i'm not sure if you

62
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,200
heard the news it can happen a second

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
time

64
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,480
but imagine where do you want to be

65
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,920
maybe you want the right teams the right

66
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,319
processes um with these processes you're

67
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,480
able to identify vulnerabilities from

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,560
the monitoring and you're able to react

69
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
quickly and what would that mean that

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,920
means you're able to

71
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
uh basically minimize damage because in

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
a lot of cases when you're reacting it's

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
about damage limitation so you're trying

74
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,040
to minimize the cost and ultimately

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,200
optimize the profit and for some cases

76
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
you know especially if you do get

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,920
breached sometimes it's about survival

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,000
or in some other situations as we

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
mentioned before maybe you are

80
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
undergoing some kind of compliance audit

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
and you want to stay compliant year two

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
year three year four

83
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,360
so am i talking about all these

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,159
situations on the left hand side

85
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
well no matter where you are on your

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,440
journey right now

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
i think in most cases you are where you

88
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,480
are

89
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
based on your decisions and based on

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
your processes to date

91
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,120
so if you're not getting to where you

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
need to be right now in security

93
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
would you agree that you need to follow

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
a different kind of path would you need

95
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
to agree to follow a different kind of

96
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,640
methodology

97
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,800
so you need to follow proven methods to

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,959
protect your business so and that's why

99
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,319
i'm here to talk to you about is one

100
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,080
thing that can help you improve your

101
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,640
security no matter where you are on your

102
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,799
security journey right now

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,560
and it's a very straightforward step to

104
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,680
help you to help prevent a breach

105
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
especially in this digital age we're all

106
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
connected there's lots of business

107
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,879
information and lots of customer

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,360
information oops

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,400
so

110
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,920
what's the number one asset in the world

111
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,200
right now

112
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,120
it's not oil it's not gold and of course

113
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,599
we're honest talk because we are focused

114
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,920
and we specialize in data and the thing

115
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,519
and the reality is right now we've got

116
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,840
legislations especially in europe or

117
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
european customers we've got things like

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,879
gdpr

119
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,720
um if you are taking payments then of

120
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
course there's pci dss

121
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
you've got hipaa you've got socks etc

122
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
and there's more legislations are coming

123
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,159
out and the standards are changing all

124
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:12,840
the

125
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,000
time and when i've gone into with you

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,079
um um a lot of

127
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,839
customers right now a lot when i

128
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,000
actually start asking and probing these

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
questions a lot of the companies

130
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
actually are on the back foot

131
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
and but maybe you've heard the phrase

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,479
prevention is better than the cure and

133
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,840
it's so true

134
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,520
and it reminds me of a story about one

135
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
of my clients who failed badly on this

136
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,199
one thing we're going to be discussing

137
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,759
in this talk

138
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,479
it's january 2011.

139
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,000
so it's in the winter time in the

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,080
northwest of the uk

141
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,759
i'm at the sitting

142
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,000
in these i'm standing in this toy store

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
in the warehouse at the top floor under

144
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,600
a tin roof

145
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,919
the rain is hitting this tin roof and

146
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,160
this large dome white these kind of

147
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,639
lighter warehouse lamps

148
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
to my left and to my right

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
there's metal shelving

150
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,720
on the left shelving there's the airfix

151
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,360
toys like cars and airplanes

152
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
i remember the time we used to glue them

153
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
together and make these models

154
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
on the right hand side there's humvee

155
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
railway sets but in front of me there's

156
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,840
simon

157
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
he's got a suit on he's got a bald head

158
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
with a thick ring glasses

159
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,960
he looked more like a banker than some

160
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,440
kind of managing director of a store and

161
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,800
simon says to me

162
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
hey mike thanks for coming back i know

163
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
you warned us this could happen and i i

164
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,520
didn't really believe it and i said to

165
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,720
simon

166
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
what's the matter simon well the bank is

167
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
starting to charge us uh penalties and

168
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,880
fines for non-compliance for our credit

169
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,639
debit card security

170
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,199
we we've had a go we've can't implement

171
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,600
the tech controls to fix everything it's

172
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
costly it's too much times too much

173
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
overhead too much tech jargon i just

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
need something simple please help

175
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,960
and this is a classic example of

176
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
throwing money at technology solutions

177
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
with all the bells and whistles because

178
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
it's just not right for the business

179
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,560
they were actually

180
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
over optimistic about their security or

181
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,120
when we looked at it lack of security

182
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,280
when we really reviewed their systems

183
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
and their environments and that's what

184
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,479
we did i sat down with them we looked at

185
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,560
the environments and as you probably

186
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,680
imagined

187
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
as a toy store they had a front desk

188
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,080
where customers come in so they

189
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,759
processed and captured

190
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,080
um car data on the retail point of

191
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,400
systems upon the cell systems

192
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
that went and flow through to car dating

193
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
the back end databases

194
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,639
there was backups of the databases

195
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,880
archives with card data and not just

196
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,800
that they've got a call center

197
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,440
um whereby customers can call up on

198
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,319
their voip that the network telephone

199
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,759
systems

200
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,120
so we're capturing that way on our

201
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,280
network and the agents are writing down

202
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,440
the card data because as a toy store you

203
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,840
often don't deliver immediately so you'd

204
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,759
write down the card details in the books

205
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,000
it's shocking

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
and with the point of sale systems i'm

207
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
not sure if you know but usually as a

208
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,599
customer you get your customer receipts

209
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,759
but also on the merchant side

210
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,919
the merchant gets a copy

211
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,919
and especially things are changing now

212
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,080
but still there's lots of places where

213
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,759
the merchant receipt has your card

214
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,720
details the long 16 digits 16 to 19

215
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
digits depending where you are in the

216
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,319
world and your expiry date you can do a

217
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,880
lot of damage with that

218
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,639
so i gave them some recommendations to

219
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,120
change the way the business operates

220
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,240
i get a call a week later no sorry mike

221
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,960
we can't do your recommended changes

222
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,479
this is a family business we've been

223
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,240
doing the things the same way the same

224
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
process we just

225
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
don't like change and i said sam this is

226
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
kind of what you need to do because if

227
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,759
you don't do this and if you don't

228
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,680
persuade them um

229
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,280
otherwise the consequences could be

230
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,360
quite dire as you know based on the

231
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
letters your fines are only going to get

232
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
bigger and bigger and bigger and as i

233
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,599
said if nothing gets done they will

234
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,400
shoot your card facilities

235
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,000
how would you feel

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,120
if you were

237
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,680
a toy store or retail store

238
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,520
collecting these details

239
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,840
over the retail

240
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,440
internet over telephone how would you

241
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,039
feel if they said we're not going to be

242
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,680
taking car payments anymore

243
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
for most businesses you would have to

244
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
shop

245
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
anyway they got things done they changed

246
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
they did the things we recommended they

247
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
changed the business process and it got

248
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,520
compliant quicker and easier without

249
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,000
less technology and they're a lot safer

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,479
as a consequence of that but remember we

251
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,159
don't get secure from compliance

252
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
compliance follows good security

253
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,000
and i thought to myself there's got to

254
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,880
be a better way to help these small

255
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,800
medium enterprises without going to too

256
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,160
much technical

257
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
uh jargon and focused money operation so

258
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
i put my programming hats on use my 20

259
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,720
years in security plus over 10 years in

260
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,640
audit risk to come up with something and

261
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
it came with my framework so this is the

262
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
protect protocol and i don't have time

263
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
to go through right now but what i want

264
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,839
to focus on is one section which is

265
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,519
about planning

266
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,440
the business secure blueprint

267
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,720
and in the business secure blueprint

268
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
this really allows you to kind of like

269
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,399
assess your security policy in your

270
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,240
business and the very first thing that

271
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
you need to do is understand your scope

272
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,160
so what do i need or mean by scope it's

273
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
really about what needs to be included

274
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,800
as part of your security assessments

275
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,720
because without this without the the

276
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,200
correct scope if you do have incorrect

277
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,279
scope assets may not be identified

278
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,519
assets may not be protected

279
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,440
information may be forgotten and of

280
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,760
course that consequently could lead to

281
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,560
theft or loss because reality is is that

282
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
you don't know what you don't know

283
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,920
and if you don't know what you don't

284
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
know how can you protect the info

285
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,920
but when you do get this right you

286
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,399
better understand what information uh

287
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,320
what assets you have in your business

288
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,839
which means that you can better control

289
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,920
you know introduce better controls to

290
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,600
protect those assets

291
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,040
and hopefully in a more pragmatic and

292
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,600
cost effective manner but my scoping is

293
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
hard right

294
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
no i disagree with that the reality is

295
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,120
when i go into businesses we walk

296
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
through this process it's just primarily

297
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
because you need to follow a method to

298
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,120
scope most businesses don't have this

299
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,279
methodology or a methodology at least i

300
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,959
don't have a documented

301
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,880
that's really the truth and the point is

302
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
that if you don't have methodology if

303
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
the scope changes later on especially

304
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
when we're doing audits

305
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,600
you're kind of firefighting because and

306
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
then you'll have to go back and change

307
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,839
things upstream as well

308
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,399
there's um an ex-american president

309
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,480
called abraham lincoln

310
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
and abraham lincoln i'm not sure if

311
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,800
you're aware there's a news to me before

312
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,519
abraham was a skilled woodcutter before

313
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,279
becoming president

314
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,240
he said

315
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,040
give me six hours to chop down a tree

316
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
and i will spend the first four hours

317
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,279
sharpening the axe

318
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,880
so would you agree that it's important

319
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
to prepare and get the process right

320
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,600
first time because again if you fail to

321
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,399
plan

322
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,959
you plan to fail

323
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,800
so just quickly as well going to start

324
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,040
the scoping process on a very high level

325
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,360
so in scope i know there's a a gentleman

326
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,200
called bruce schneider and he

327
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,640
coined the term people process and

328
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,720
technology but i'd like to

329
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,279
include information so tip tippy

330
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,120
technology information people and

331
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
process and instruction in this way that

332
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
you know we're here to protect

333
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,120
information information is consumed and

334
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,920
processed in a way to get some kind of

335
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,000
desired output and of course supporting

336
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,120
the process we've got people and

337
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,640
technology in order to conduct those

338
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,120
whether it's manual or automated so the

339
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,560
objective here is to understand what

340
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,440
with information we have um so we can

341
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,200
choose what assets to protect as well so

342
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,959
that's our objective here is to get a

343
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,959
list of information and a list of

344
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,839
technology later for when you take on

345
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,160
the uh security assessment

346
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,440
so let's start with

347
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
process

348
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,560
so again we step away i mean a lot of

349
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,800
people can focus on the actual data

350
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,839
flows deep dive into data flows first

351
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,519
but if we just take a step back this is

352
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,440
one way to do it take that 30 000 foot

353
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
high level view what are divisions

354
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,360
what's our process in our business and

355
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,279
then what you can do from that is and

356
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,040
drill down into these high level

357
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,680
processes into the sub processes find

358
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,120
out the people and what kind of

359
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,560
activities are they doing what kind of

360
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,639
tasks are they performing

361
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
so one of the things you you can take

362
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,920
from this and maybe look an

363
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,480
organizational chart of your business to

364
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,279
help have that starting point

365
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,959
so once you look at the processes so

366
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,120
processes tasks etc then you're trying

367
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,639
to look at the types of information and

368
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,000
this is just a

369
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,560
very high level overview of the types of

370
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,360
information so you may have some

371
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
business information so things like

372
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,560
business plans

373
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,959
you could use um

374
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,440
also uh maybe some mission statements

375
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,760
potentially you may have some economic

376
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,920
things and maybe some financial data

377
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,000
financial forecasting cash flow profit

378
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,399
loss things like this and that's

379
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,000
especially important if you are a public

380
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,760
limited company

381
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
you may have things like admin so things

382
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,680
like maybe uh your

383
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,480
hrc might have some employee files and

384
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
maybe you have some legal things with

385
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
legal values so maybe things like i've

386
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,680
done it if you do but some some

387
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,160
businesses value their patents because

388
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
you don't want to get that or

389
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,639
intellectual property in the wrong hands

390
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,279
so ask yourself what kind of assets do i

391
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,680
want to protect um

392
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,360
focusing on the people and technology

393
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
sides here's just a quick whistle stop

394
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,079
tour think about sites so what doing buy

395
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,320
sites so things that um support your

396
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,440
business

397
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,000
maybe the availability of information so

398
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,440
things like your server room and your

399
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,279
air conditioning what happens if that no

400
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,279
that goes down will the server room

401
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,279
overheat will the systems break

402
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,040
you may have your cctv that supports

403
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
your security may have a call center

404
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,399
where information is processed

405
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,680
applications

406
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,519
in most cases people and businesses are

407
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,279
very good at identifying the web apps

408
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,040
that might be in scope they tend to

409
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,800
forget the technology supporting it so

410
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,320
things like your web server apps

411
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,680
behind the scenes

412
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,560
um things like databases as well

413
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,720
um and backups of those databases and

414
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,880
client-side apps

415
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
endpoints that businesses are pretty

416
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,399
good at this so usually identifying

417
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,399
their endpoints like laptops and

418
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,839
desktops

419
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,320
servers they're very good at they tend

420
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,639
to fall behind things like the backups

421
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,000
and the disk drives that might be lying

422
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,920
around especially disk drives because a

423
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,680
lot of people just

424
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,240
try to physically destroy it without

425
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,680
removing the actual electronic

426
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
information

427
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
and think of things like your security

428
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,800
systems like access systems that might

429
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,959
be in the scope for certain controls

430
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,279
people businesses are very good at

431
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,360
identifying the users in scope

432
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,880
sometimes you know there might be some

433
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,720
security assessments whereby you need to

434
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
speak to developers or decision makers

435
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
as well because there might be things in

436
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
your software secure development life

437
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,160
cycle ssdlc you may want to speak to

438
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,480
project teams because change control is

439
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,199
interesting and how you especially um

440
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,040
how you implement change control in

441
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,839
projects because a lot of projects you

442
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,160
introduce new technologies you take our

443
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
technologies and that can really affect

444
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
your scope

445
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,120
third party as well is very important

446
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,959
for um

447
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,480
that if they were compromised how would

448
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,720
it compromise your company and finally

449
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,480
of course networks that support your

450
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,600
business process for data

451
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
so what are these opinion what are my

452
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
tangible assets

453
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,040
so next we get this information about

454
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
the processes we talked about first and

455
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,079
from the proceed to talk about

456
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,000
information and the people in technology

457
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
we put it down in some kind of asset

458
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,320
list so i'm not going to go into through

459
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,079
all this for the interest of time but

460
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,600
we've got this information about the

461
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,040
processes the information that's

462
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,399
collected

463
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,079
with speaking to the people what

464
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,920
software are they using to process

465
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,560
information and the underlying systems

466
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
so let's talk about systems you're going

467
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,759
to be evaluating now so

468
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,680
this is something that especially in pci

469
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,279
you need to do but

470
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,639
you need to play in your business as

471
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,839
well and this gives you some kind of

472
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,160
methodology so first of all there are

473
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
systems that directly process store

474
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,320
transmit that data

475
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
so what is that data is it credit cards

476
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
debit cards names emails any kind of

477
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,600
gdpr so those kind of systems will form

478
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
the data environment

479
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,240
you got category 2 devices which are

480
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,399
nothing to do with the processing of

481
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,800
that data but they happen to be in the

482
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,959
same environment or they're connected to

483
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,560
the data environment

484
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,079
and we'll talk through this shortly as

485
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,240
with some examples or number three

486
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
security impacting systems this could be

487
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,759
things like your firewall systems your

488
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,759
access control systems things to do with

489
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,959
antivirus

490
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,959
etc etc

491
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,360
so how do we apply this

492
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,079
so

493
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,440
i'll be applying this to some kind of

494
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,600
network but just for some kind of

495
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,440
analogy i'm trying to use a bank

496
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,759
environment uh just for simplicity and

497
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,120
you won't find this any bank because

498
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
that'll be quite ridiculous i have seen

499
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,160
in the past when i've been reviewing

500
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,639
some banks but things are changing so

501
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,160
just imagine that you've got a bank it's

502
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,040
one huge building on here and let's say

503
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,600
for example our data it may be credit

504
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,400
cards debit cards or maybe even cash

505
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,520
so the

506
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,359
the the customers come through this door

507
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,559
right here

508
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,559
and it's stored in the safe so this

509
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,559
there's a flow of the assets through

510
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,480
here which means this is our data

511
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,160
environment

512
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,240
so what about these yellow things these

513
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,319
daughters these category two items why

514
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,559
are these important because hopefully

515
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,959
these are all locked no one can access

516
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,799
it no one can compromise it but if they

517
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,319
were compromised

518
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,160
if they if people were allowed through

519
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,000
these doors this could be used as a

520
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,640
jumping point to start attacking our

521
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,320
critical assets

522
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,520
so i'm not sure if you've seen things

523
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,919
like movies whereby they try and

524
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,720
compromise entrances doors windows but

525
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,919
not just that they may even go to

526
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,679
through the ventilation shaft classic

527
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,799
right

528
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,200
the connected areas but also they may

529
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,440
decide to impact these gray ones these

530
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,120
category three items so again in the

531
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,679
movies to try and compromise the cctv or

532
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,600
access control system

533
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,840
to let them

534
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,120
in so let's see how we can take this

535
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,559
forward

536
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,880
so think about in terms of network this

537
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,720
flat environment maybe you've got a

538
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,039
website with a web machine

539
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,760
so

540
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,160
customers can access this information or

541
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
um enter this information because the

542
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,000
information may not be stored but even

543
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,320
just processed or transmitted this

544
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,799
becomes our data environment

545
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,400
and because these machines aren't in the

546
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,520
same environment these are connected to

547
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,120
inherently

548
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,200
and because maybe you may have some

549
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,720
security systems hopefully you don't

550
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,320
have it in the same area but if you do

551
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
have some security systems in a flat

552
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,280
environment and i've seen this time and

553
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,559
time again

554
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,840
these are always in scope because

555
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,760
they're security impacting

556
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,840
so i hope that makes sense so far

557
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,880
because you're going to take it forward

558
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,080
next

559
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,919
and this is it often the case when

560
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,840
you're reviewing say for example this

561
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,280
bank analogy they come in maybe cash

562
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,559
or cards

563
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,400
they are handled maybe in this public

564
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,640
area and maybe their staff who take it

565
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
to the back room

566
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,240
to store in some saves and this is very

567
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,679
very common

568
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,400
so

569
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
the information or assets flow through

570
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,400
here so this these red areas become our

571
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
data environments

572
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,600
inherently you've got connected two

573
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,960
devices because they're in the same

574
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,240
environment

575
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,600
what about this area over here there's

576
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,400
no

577
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480
data being transmitted

578
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,080
but maybe it's for example a finance

579
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,360
team and the finance team has some

580
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,480
entrances

581
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,880
who whereby they could enter and it's

582
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,360
connected to the data environment so

583
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,559
these are

584
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,240
points of being in scope because if you

585
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,559
compromise this you could get into the

586
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,840
data environment

587
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,000
and of course you got your areas of

588
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
systems whereby they could impact

589
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,520
security

590
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
so with that in mind um let me quickly

591
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
move on is that

592
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
um

593
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
what do we do we need to basically get

594
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,760
this information we need to try and

595
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,520
categorize it as you mentioned category

596
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,840
one category category three and i've put

597
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,280
in some extra information that you

598
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,440
probably have for when you've identified

599
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,600
the systems examples of serial numbers

600
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,840
what did it do what's the model etc but

601
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
the most important thing is the

602
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
categorization

603
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,480
first you've got to document it

604
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
formalize it and then identify the

605
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,880
category 1 category 2 and category 3

606
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,200
items

607
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,280
so what next you would identify the

608
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,440
process of the information and the

609
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,960
people and technologies but in this case

610
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,039
we focus on systems

611
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,039
now well what are we going to uh going

612
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,720
to assess in our security system are we

613
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,120
going to assess everything in most cases

614
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
especially large environments you just

615
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,039
can't securely assess everything it's

616
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,960
just not practical

617
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
in some smaller cases small environments

618
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
you can and you can

619
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,919
assess pretty much the entire

620
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,840
environment but if you can't this gives

621
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,120
you some kind of rationale and

622
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
methodology and that's to do some kind

623
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,720
of sampling

624
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,200
so if you take a representative sample

625
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,799
that will you know at least give you

626
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,080
some kind of level of assurance that

627
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,679
your security

628
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,000
processes are right

629
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
and the more you can standardize the

630
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,799
better

631
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,559
for example if you standardize the way

632
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,480
you build machines

633
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
maybe you can reduce the amount of

634
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,919
sample you you want to security review

635
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,600
if you've got um

636
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,080
five two or three or four different ways

637
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,880
across the world to build systems then

638
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,640
maybe assessing one will not be

639
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,400
representative of the other so you need

640
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,240
to kind of think about that so let's say

641
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
for example in our sampling approach

642
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,360
there's

643
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
in our example 100 servers you could

644
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,960
take a hell of a protein set i'm just

645
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,360
going to sample 20.

646
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,720
okay it's not great but give your

647
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,840
starting point ideally the more it get

648
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,000
the better is for your um security

649
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,679
reviews so let's say you could take this

650
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,919
100 servers make it maybe say there's 20

651
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,120
linux type systems maybe 80 windows type

652
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,480
systems

653
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,919
then you can take that for and say maybe

654
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,520
i'm going to sample 12 linux and maybe

655
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,400
18

656
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,640
windows for example

657
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,159
but when we do audits usually when we

658
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,840
we are asked as security assessment

659
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,159
auditors we try to get a representative

660
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,159
sample and that means um

661
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,480
especially under compliance we go on for

662
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,240
kind of role base because depending on

663
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,400
the role of the system they can it can

664
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,520
be different kind of security

665
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,400
configurations some might be in your dmz

666
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,480
or public zones which may be more at

667
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,679
risk

668
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,520
so for example in this case if we break

669
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,919
down these 100 servers maybe got five

670
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,559
web and we've got a few apps domains

671
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,280
emails and say for example the remainder

672
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,520
or other servers we then say what's a

673
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,120
representative sample of five web

674
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
servers is it two was it three maybe

675
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,960
three because it's over fifty percent as

676
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,240
an example

677
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,559
and we take that on board we take um a

678
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,559
number that we feel is representative

679
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,559
but it's all based on the methodology

680
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,480
that we document for the business

681
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,080
so let's summarize what we've done so

682
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,320
we've gone through the high level 30 000

683
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,159
foot view of the business to identify

684
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,480
the processes the sub processes the

685
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,520
tasks

686
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,280
we've gotten to try to find out the

687
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,360
types of information in within the

688
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,960
business the business information

689
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,280
customer information

690
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,520
we've looked at maybe the data flows to

691
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,960
identify the

692
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,440
systems that are connected to

693
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,960
that are directly processing or

694
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,880
transmitting storing information or

695
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,200
maybe the category two three systems

696
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,360
which are the security systems so when

697
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,760
you are in compliance you need to do all

698
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,840
this for example pci you need to think

699
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,200
of all these kind of category one

700
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,360
category two and category three items

701
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,799
but if you haven't got that kind of

702
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,679
security burden then at least focus on

703
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,480
your

704
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,400
category one which is your critical

705
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,240
systems and the category fee which is

706
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,799
your security systems that could infect

707
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,880
your environment and most importantly

708
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
you need to document your scoping

709
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,240
methodology i know that a lot of

710
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,200
businesses go to is that they don't have

711
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
a scoping methodology and secondly they

712
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,000
don't document it and if it's not

713
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,919
documented it's not kind of done and you

714
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,159
need to get it done so it's consistent

715
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,679
so it doesn't matter if i do it you do

716
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,600
it anyone else does it you kind of get

717
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,960
to the right kind of point for scoping

718
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,880
so i know of which through that try and

719
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,240
give you as much information as possible

720
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
and allow for q a

721
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,000
but here's my uh details if you want to

722
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,919
connect with me and again thank you so

723
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,840
much to the team at digital over this

724
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,679
it's really you know fantastic

725
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,279
conference and thanks for the

726
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,200
opportunity to share

727
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,720
uh what i have with you

728
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,600
so that's the end of my presentation uh

729
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,080
ready for q a

730
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,320
that was fantastic

731
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,360
great way to kick off the day

732
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,240
um

733
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,120
so

734
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,240
we do

735
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,159
we have had one question for the moment

736
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,039
uh we'll see if uh others pop up

737
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,960
but uh one of them was about the slides

738
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,679
are you going to make them public

739
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,960
i'm more than happy to more than happy

740
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,200
to i'll work with you guys to find out

741
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,039
what's the best way to do that

742
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,039
it's awesome perfect

743
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,039
yeah and this was all concise and really

744
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,880
straight to the point and easy to digest

745
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
so thank you for this awesome

746
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,559
presentation that was uh fantastic and i

747
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,679
know a lot of other people enjoyed it

748
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,679
that's why they're asking for the slides

749
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,440
i think uh it's a good source of

750
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,799
learning material right there and you

751
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,240
don't see a whole lot on compliance

752
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,159
nowadays it's all hacking and security

753
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,240
related so this was a nice treat i'd

754
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,159
like to say

755
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,600
yeah absolutely as you know it's a very

756
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,960
important point to make you know we do

757
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
focus on the pen testing for an ability

758
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
test but if you're talking about how it

759
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,159
secure my business we can talk about

760
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,159
metrics afterwards but you've got to do

761
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,919
a security assessment that's the

762
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,840
starting point find out your gaps if you

763
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,200
need to do pen tests that will be

764
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,159
highlighted in your gaps

765
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,200
yep

766
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,640
thank you so much any other questions

767
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,919
rolling

768
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,200
um well i mean i had one um

769
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,799
do you think

770
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,840
that

771
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,400
as you know time progresses

772
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,480
and more obsolete uh compliance issues

773
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,080
start mounting up

774
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,960
you know you have a one standard that

775
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,440
overrules another etc etc but they still

776
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,600
exist is this going to cause an issue in

777
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
the long run

778
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,640
i don't think it's going to cause an

779
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,919
issue but i would say is that if it's um

780
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,400
a standard that is supported what you

781
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,880
usually find is that there will be

782
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,360
the standards will be updated as per the

783
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,200
risks to the environment for example a

784
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,919
hypersox and for example um pci

785
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,080
especially pci pci version 4 has just

786
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,400
come out

787
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,840
based on the risk to the environment and

788
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,679
what is happening behind the scenes in

789
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,039
the card space you also have iso 27001

790
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,279
that's being updated um soon or recently

791
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,919
i need to check um because of the the

792
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,039
things that have been happening so it's

793
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,400
all based on historical um performance

794
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,120
and also what's happening in our uh you

795
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,039
know modern

796
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,880
culture and communities what's happening

797
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,960
out there and we we all it's that cat

798
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,799
and mouse game you know between the

799
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,679
attackers and the defenders and we need

800
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,039
to respond to that and update the

801
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,720
standards based on what they see and

802
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,440
what is happening for example uh for

803
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,840
example in the card space as well we

804
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,480
changed a long time ago from

805
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,440
um

806
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,000
usual payment systems to chip and pin

807
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,679
and what you saw is that a lot of fraud

808
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,760
went away from say

809
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,320
one stream for example in the retail

810
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,039
and it moved from retail down to

811
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,760
uh to online so you saw a big increase

812
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,279
in fraud online

813
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,200
so the standards have changed based on

814
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,120
what we see and you'll see that time and

815
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,799
time again and as i said before there's

816
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,480
new legislations the new standards being

817
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,880
brought out um every so often and it's

818
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,400
very hard to keep up with this but what

819
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,760
i would mention is

820
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,840
stick to standards that apply to you if

821
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,159
you don't have one try look at cis for

822
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,960
example cis top 18

823
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,279
and also especially for example nist

824
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,279
this is a great benchmark to get

825
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,640
yourself started

826
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,799
and they'll say how secure we

827
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,320
benchmark yourselves against those

828
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,679
standards

829
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,880
awesome

830
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
i um

831
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,080
yeah i have

832
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,760
i mean i'm gonna bump off a statement

833
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,799
that uh james just uh said uh how would

834
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,080
you deal uh with people that

835
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,399
categorically refuse to uh price a

836
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,039
project without budget or time

837
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,200
you know that includes scoping and uh

838
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,360
discovery

839
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,760
so can you repeat that question again

840
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,840
yeah sorry

841
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,279
uh so uh

842
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,880
james mentioned that he knows people

843
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,399
that would refuse to price a project

844
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,640
without budget and time for scoping in

845
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,399
discovery how would you deal with

846
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,320
clients that uh that are like that

847
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,039
what i'd probably say is that um i would

848
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,520
advise that to to again formalize the

849
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,480
actual

850
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,320
project management lifecycle because if

851
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
you don't include those critical

852
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,440
elements

853
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,880
what could that mean

854
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,960
as we know in projects it's usually over

855
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,279
time and it's usually over budget

856
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,960
so that would indicate to me that

857
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,480
they're not formalizing or they're not

858
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,720
using standard map practices for example

859
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,880
prince2 or other kind of methodologies

860
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,320
in project management

861
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,720
and it's just a software it is

862
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,559
today it is

863
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,039
250 000 pounds or

864
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,960
you know it's you're going to go over

865
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,480
the budget you're going over time and if

866
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,559
you don't include formalized security

867
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,559
controls checkpoints

868
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,600
you're going to find that you're going

869
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,240
to be firefighting all the time so

870
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,159
you've you implemented oh we forgot

871
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,399
about this or there's you know you do a

872
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,760
pen test and there's gaping holes in

873
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,600
your security system because when you

874
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,559
introduce new projects you introduce new

875
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,360
risks so you need to do bi a business

876
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,760
impact analysis and for example if you

877
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,600
are doing things like um

878
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,760
regulations such as gdpr it's very

879
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
important you include these things that

880
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,919
are business impact analysis for

881
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,000
uh data protection

882
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,679
it's all about formalizing that

883
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,080
methodology and project methodology if

884
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,240
that makes sense and that's the emphasis

885
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,760
you always get people from time to time

886
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,320
but as james mentioned but you've got to

887
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,000
push back and you've got to

888
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,840
show them the importance and in most

889
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,399
cases the return on investment if they

890
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,320
include these controls and checks at the

891
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,399
beginning

892
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,320
okay and just to round it off we have

893
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,279
one final question uh what advice do you

894
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,679
have for use case in which a customer

895
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,679
might not like the scoping outcome as

896
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,279
it's going to cause too many headaches

897
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,960
to fix

898
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,039
absolutely that happens time and time

899
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,559
again um

900
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,720
when you are doing scoping and when you

901
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,880
are under some kind of compliance burden

902
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,559
you just have to refer to the standards

903
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,559
and say this is the situation you need

904
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,159
to go through it and then you start

905
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,679
doing a prioritization approach what

906
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,159
your critical ones um

907
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,840
critical systems that you need to focus

908
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,240
on for example the category one systems

909
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,840
that process store and transmit the

910
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,520
category three which is your security

911
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,480
systems

912
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
and then focus on your category two

913
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,159
devices connected to or you can take

914
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,840
some kind of a categorization approach

915
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,000
but this is all about prioritization

916
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,399
to get to where you want to be right

917
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,640
yeah so you're not gonna get security

918
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,159
tomorrow it's a maybe 16 6 to 18 month

919
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,679
journey in most cases for most

920
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,679
businesses

921
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,279
awesome

922
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,240
well i think that closes off uh our time

923
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,840
for the talk it was fantastic having you

924
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,520
here pleasure's all mine thank you to

925
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,840
the team
