1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
all right thank you so much skully

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,200
so hello everyone

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,920
i'm b some of you may know me as b some

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,920
of you just know me as outlaw some of

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,239
you may even know me as tori but not

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,840
many of you do

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,359
i am a high school student taking my

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,400
ap elective or my other give us ap

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,000
computer science

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,039
and

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,240
i just really like tech to be honest

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,640
i've been a part of digital overdose

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,360
since january 18 2021 that's about a

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,480
year ago

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,079
a little over a year ago

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,760
my first introduction

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,640
introduction with stem is was from girl

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,120
scouts of the usa i am still part of

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,239
them

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,399
i'm going on my eighth year now but i

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
haven't been programming until about two

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,320
years ago so it's fairly new to me

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,680
my favorite animals are frogs and bees

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,840
and i'm just really interested in

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,039
helping end the classes gap in tech to

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,040
be honest there's

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
a lot of countries out there that

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,360
you know may not have access to the tech

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,640
that i have and i want to fix that

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,520
so just a little side note and

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,880
disclaimer

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,799
i don't have any

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,280
present employers or past employers but

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,920
anything i say or do in this

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,119
program is no is not

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,759
a reflection on them

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,320
and i am not a official historian i'm

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,880
just a person in their laptop and a lot

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
of this information has been lost to

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
time sadly so

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,000
it's really just hard to find so if

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,479
anything's wrong please don't feel

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
afraid to correct me to reach out

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,439
because i would love to talk with you

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,600
thank you

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,479
so

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,840
first thing we're gonna have three

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,719
chapters the first one is on ancient

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,680
civilizations and our pre-tech era

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,600
then we will be covering world wars one

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,880
and two which is our

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
beginning of the tech era

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,440
technically and cryptography fails and

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,280
some techniques used by children

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,760
so first what is cryptography and can it

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,200
like how are we confusing it with

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
steganography

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,800
so

59
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,000
steganography means that the message

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,160
just needs to be uncovered whereas

61
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
cryptography means that the message

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,239
needs to be decrypted

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,400
so

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,160
first we'll be covering our ancient

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,200
cryptography let's get started

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,360
so from around the 7th century to the

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
3rd century they had the cyto the saddle

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
is a piece of leather or paper that was

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,480
wrapped around a wooden piece of a

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
specific diameter

71
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
the message is written on

72
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,159
the piece of leather and sent to the

73
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,319
receiver the person would have a piece

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,640
of wood of a similar diameter

75
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,480
and would wrap the leather around it to

76
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,800
reveal their message

77
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,040
this was used by the greeks it was first

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,080
talked about by the poet archaelagus and

79
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,159
the first directions were written by the

80
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,840
philosopher apollonius

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,080
next we have his stace

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
hysterias is servant my apologies

83
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,920
now hysterius was the tyrant of melitus

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,680
which is in greece

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
he learned of the attack of the persians

86
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,200
and so he shaved his servant's head

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,519
he then tattooed the servant's head with

88
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
his message and waited for the hair to

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
grow back a little bit

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,120
there

91
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,080
as as a stagger as his nephew was able

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,720
to shave his head and see the message

93
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,959
and they were able to take down

94
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,680
their enemies

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,080
while this is technically not

96
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,360
cryptography but rather steganography we

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,519
should mention it as it was important to

98
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,680
the history of cryptography later as we

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,360
can still see similar techniques today

100
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,680
next we have the caesar cipher so the

101
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
caesar cipher is an early version of our

102
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
rotation cipher that was used and

103
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,560
popularized by julius caesar

104
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,199
he used it in a lot of his personal life

105
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,639
and in his

106
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,520
uh military campaigns and it is kind of

107
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,320
one of the things that made him so great

108
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,759
he was

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,680
really i guess you could say iconic

110
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,960
the vegan air cipher was so secure that

111
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,840
it was not cracked by

112
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,639
not cracked for 30 centuries

113
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,400
it was created in 1553 by giovanne

114
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,160
batista belazo and named after blade

115
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,880
blaise de vigener

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,759
it was called the indecipherable cipher

117
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,199
by the french

118
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,000
the cipher works by combining combining

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
the numerical values of the letters in

120
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
the message with the numerical values of

121
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,160
the letters on the table

122
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,400
i have a

123
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,759
similar

124
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
set up here as you can see

125
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
therefore it creates a secret message

126
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,160
next we will be talking about probably

127
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,560
one of my favorite things in this talk

128
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
agent 355

129
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
this is also

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,039
the culpers firing code

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,560
so agent 355 was one of the first states

132
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,039
first spies in the united states and her

133
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,680
identity still remains a mystery today

134
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
that's right she was a female spy that's

135
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,520
so cool

136
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
um some things are clear from the way

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,759
the culprits talked about her it is

138
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,440
likely that she

139
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
worked with the american patriots during

140
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
the revolutionary war as

141
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,400
a spy and was likely recruited by

142
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,880
woodhull himself into the spy ring

143
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,440
woodhull was the guy who ran this firing

144
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
the way the code is constructed

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
indicates that she may have had some

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,120
degree of social prominence she was also

147
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,880
likely living in new york city at the

148
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
time and at some point had contact with

149
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,840
mayor john andre and benedict benedict

150
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,199
arnold

151
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
she was also only mentioned

152
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
once in a letter between george

153
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,440
washington and abraham woodhull with

154
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
little mention of her anywhere else in

155
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,039
history

156
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,240
when you decode the culprits firing or

157
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,120
the

158
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
system that they used

159
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,120
the number 355 translates to lady that's

160
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,960
how we know that she was a lady spy

161
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,240
all right so next we will be going over

162
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,759
world wars one and two which is the

163
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,599
beginning of our tech era

164
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,400
so obviously if you're

165
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,960
like into world wars one and two you

166
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,400
know the world wars you'll have

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
obviously heard about the zimmermann

168
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,599
note

169
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,520
this was a note between germany and

170
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,759
mexico that tried to convince mexico to

171
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,080
join the war on germany's side in

172
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,960
exchange for american land

173
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,520
the british had intercepted this note

174
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
and decoded it as it was a series of

175
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,479
numbers but it was also in german so

176
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,639
they had to decode it from numbers to

177
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,199
from numbers to german to english

178
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,440
and then they sent it to america and

179
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,960
said hey

180
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,758
this is not good

181
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,199
this

182
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,360
became a public outrage

183
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
so the contents of the note became a

184
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,039
public outrage

185
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:55,919
and

186
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,960
it pulled america into the great war as

187
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,000
it was called in the time

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
now the grill cipher

189
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,599
was a technique for encrypting a plain

190
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,160
text by writing it onto a sheet of paper

191
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,199
through a pierced sheet so either

192
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,039
another sheet of paper or a piece of

193
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,440
cardboard i believe there are also

194
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,759
wooden ones out there as well

195
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,120
um the earliest known description is

196
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,800
from

197
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,440
a 1550 my apologies uh his proposal

198
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
the proposal was for a rectangular

199
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
stencil allowing single single letters

200
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,080
syllables or words to be written then

201
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,839
read through the spaces

202
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,000
the written fragments of the plain text

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,799
could be further disguised by filling

204
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,640
the gaps between the fragments with

205
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,279
compacted words or letters thus creating

206
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,920
it like a scrambled effect

207
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,760
the variant is also an

208
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,399
example of steganography as are many of

209
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,880
the grill ciphers there are multiple

210
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
types of real cipher out there

211
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
not only was this concept used in world

212
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,760
war one by the germans but it also has

213
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,519
been used by the american

214
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,160
known as the zodiac killer i'm sorry

215
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
twitch please don't

216
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,800
please don't yell at us

217
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,120
um

218
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,000
we have the navajo code talkers now this

219
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
is probably my second favorite what they

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,880
did was very beneficial and

221
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
amazing

222
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
it was a group of 29 men all from the

223
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,519
navajo

224
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,279
nation that arrived at camp elliott near

225
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,000
san diego which is where i'm located out

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,279
of so that's pretty cool in may 1942 the

227
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,839
code was the code used word association

228
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,640
by assigning a navajo word to military

229
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,560
phrases and tactics

230
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,839
the system

231
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,160
enabled the code talkers to translate

232
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,080
about three lines of english in 20

233
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,959
seconds that was faster than any machine

234
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,959
at the time

235
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,839
around 400 code talkers participated in

236
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,920
every major marine operation in the

237
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,560
pacific theater giving the marines a

238
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,880
large advantage

239
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,760
during the nearly month-long battle for

240
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
iwo jima six navajo code talker marines

241
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,440
sex

242
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,079
successfully transmitted

243
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,800
more than 800 messages without error so

244
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,399
they were all perfect which is amazing

245
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,279
marine leadership noted after the battle

246
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,519
that the code talkers were critical to

247
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,519
the victory at iwo jima

248
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,440
at the end of the war the navajo code

249
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,839
remained unbroken the hard work of the

250
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
navajo code talkers was not recognized

251
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,880
until

252
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
after the declassification of the

253
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,560
operation in 1968 and american president

254
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
ronald reagan gave the code talkers a

255
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
certificate of recognition

256
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,839
and also declared august 14th as navajo

257
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,440
code talkers day in 1982.

258
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,200
all right the enigma machine now i feel

259
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
like a lot of people know about this

260
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
machine but we're going to learn about

261
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,120
it some more so that's i'm excited are

262
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,880
you

263
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,880
it was created by arthur scarbeias the

264
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,839
and it was and it has a lot of rotors

265
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,320
with letters on them that's scrambled

266
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
to use it one person would enter text on

267
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,760
the keyboard and another person

268
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,800
would write like what the lights

269
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,839
coordinating with the letters

270
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,000
were if the plain text was entered the

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,800
illuminated letters are the ciphertext

272
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,519
ciphertext and the opposite is true as

273
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,160
well so if you put in ciphertext it

274
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,440
would be

275
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,680
plain text

276
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,320
the rotor mechanisms change

277
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
changed the electrical connections

278
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,399
between the keys and lights of each key

279
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,560
press the security of the system

280
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
depended on machine settings that were

281
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,880
supposed to be changed daily based on

282
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,800
the keys that were mutually agreed on in

283
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,519
the past and other settings that were

284
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,279
changed for each message

285
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,680
the receiving station

286
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,920
would have to

287
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,399
would have to know and use the exact key

288
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,160
and settings employed by the first

289
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,480
station to successfully decrypt your

290
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,079
message

291
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,639
and also on the left you can see an

292
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,079
example of

293
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,680
the grill cipher

294
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,079
which is what we mentioned earlier

295
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,079
we will also be talking about the enigma

296
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,680
machine later

297
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,959
we will be revisiting that

298
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,440
oh now is my favorite part of my talk

299
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
are cryptography fails and techniques

300
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,720
that have been used by children because

301
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,200
children can also do cryptography

302
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
and i think that's pretty cool and a lot

303
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,560
of them don't even know what it is

304
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,040
some of our fails now i'm no expert on

305
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,360
this but i feel like it's still fun to

306
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
bring up

307
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,680
okay the wired equivalent privacy or the

308
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
wep

309
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,760
it suffers from key

310
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,000
key management problems

311
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,399
poor key entry and weak key space

312
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,200
it needs to be fixed

313
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,160
the md5 certificate collect collisions

314
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
they were first documented in 2004

315
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,120
and they were cracked by you could

316
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,279
collide documents and executables to

317
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,000
make a fake certificate which is

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,680
very problematic because if you enter in

319
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,600
a fake certificate

320
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
then you're entering like the wrong

321
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,800
certificate it's just bad okay

322
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,040
the enigma machine so we just mentioned

323
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,959
this earlier but

324
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,880
it failed because of the reuse of

325
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,959
settings we're using the same message

326
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,959
key over and over again and common

327
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
message formats meaning

328
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,320
if your enemies got too used to what you

329
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,720
were using as your key

330
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,199
then you

331
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,600
like it could be easily cracked

332
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,839
like easier

333
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,600
oh and our morse code now morse code

334
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,000
never technically failed

335
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,880
but it just died out with technology

336
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,680
and

337
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
like we don't use telegraphs anymore i

338
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,680
don't really know many

339
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,199
any people who use a telegraph so

340
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,519
i sure don't

341
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,320
i don't know if you guys do but

342
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,279
yeah

343
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,760
it just died out with time sadly that

344
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,720
happens to a lot of things

345
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,720
we have some common cryptography

346
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,040
techniques for kiddos

347
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,199
so a lot of these have been

348
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,839
used in

349
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,240
like classroom settings or

350
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,320
just like

351
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,600
there's a lot of

352
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,250
a lot of these i learned from

353
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,199
[Music]

354
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,279
stuff i've used in my life to be honest

355
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,320
like pig latin we have pig latin

356
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,399
basically it's the idea of this secret

357
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
language that little kids have but

358
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,680
where i'm from and in my past where i

359
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,160
used to go to school they were pretty

360
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,399
strict and you couldn't like

361
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,320
goof around or you had to watch what you

362
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,360
say

363
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,760
so

364
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,880
[Music]

365
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,279
around middle school which would be

366
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,279
grade 6 so 11 12-ish

367
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,120
me and my friends we all learned pig

368
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,639
latin

369
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,480
and

370
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,000
we would talk in class and be like hey

371
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,880
can you pass me the pencil

372
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,480
in class

373
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,639
because we weren't supposed to talk but

374
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,000
our teacher would get mad but they can't

375
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,120
get mad because they don't know what

376
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
we're saying

377
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,800
it was like some weird logic thing but

378
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,959
um the next year we had to stop it was

379
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,440
very short-lived because

380
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,880
the next year the teacher

381
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,959
what we also learned classical latin so

382
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,199
oh fun fact i learned i know classical

383
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,120
latin a bit as well

384
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,320
um

385
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,560
i'm not enough to make a conversation

386
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,680
but i i do know it so it just made our

387
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,199
latin teacher very mad and it

388
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,040
he complained to our maths teacher and

389
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,880
my math teacher

390
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,839
he knew pig latin so he was able to like

391
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,360
get us in trouble and be like stop

392
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,519
talking in my class

393
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
but it was really fun while it lasted

394
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,759
we also have morse codes so we've talked

395
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,920
about morse code morse code is easy for

396
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,959
children to follow along with it's fun

397
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,040
it's a bit harder if you hear it

398
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,639
auditorily

399
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,880
but

400
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,440
it's easy to write down

401
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,320
you might use some of it in our

402
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,440
ctf challenges later

403
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,120
oh you've seen

404
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,079
the number substitution cipher and the

405
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,360
cipher

406
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,759
in easy ctf games before if you've ever

407
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,680
played a ctf

408
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,199
we have a equals one b equals two that's

409
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,680
our number substitution very easy and z

410
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
would equal 26.

411
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,640
our

412
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
cipher is just everything is flipped

413
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
upside down so a would equal z and b

414
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,439
would equal y

415
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,959
many

416
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,679
people have used a rotation usually it's

417
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,480
in rotation of 13 but you can shift the

418
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,880
letters of the alphabet to

419
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,160
correspond with whatever you like

420
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,160
personally i love to use rotation 26

421
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,440
but

422
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,400
i just yeah rotation is probably one of

423
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,960
my favorite things to use because i just

424
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,520
like seeing the letters shift

425
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,440
you can also use the pigpen cipher now

426
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,840
this one's a little bit different and a

427
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,080
little bit more confusing but it's still

428
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,559
fun so maybe for like older kids

429
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,240
there's a grid

430
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,000
and an x

431
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,280
and there's dots and where the dots fall

432
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,720
on this grid and x is your symbols and

433
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
it just

434
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,399
it's really fun i i really enjoy it

435
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
we also have

436
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,200
on twitter i put out a

437
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,280
cfp of my own

438
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,320
and i got a couple stories so here are

439
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,679
two of them

440
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,679
from people who have also used

441
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,600
cryptography techniques before they knew

442
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,160
what it was because i was like

443
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,679
am i the only one

444
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,240
but i'm not

445
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,840
from twitter user aj 702

446
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,960
they say

447
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,200
i used unicode characters as a kid to

448
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,840
encrypt my messages until junior in

449
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,160
junior high didn't know i was using a

450
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,840
substitution cipher until many years

451
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,520
later and we also have the second one

452
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,559
from an anonymous twitter user

453
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,480
after reading about caesar ciphers and

454
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,400
similar codes i started to come up with

455
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
my own starting with substitution

456
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
ciphers where i randomized the letters

457
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
but eventually getting to a table of up

458
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,360
to 10 randomized alphabets where each

459
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,840
letter in an encoded message would be

460
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,480
assigned from different alphabet

461
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,880
from a different alphabet from the table

462
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
and the sentence of alphabet choice

463
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,039
would be determined by a numeric key

464
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,720
passed with the message

465
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,039
now that i think about it i was only a

466
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,760
couple small steps away from reinventing

467
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,200
the one-time pad at about nine years old

468
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,520
the only thing i lacked was friends to

469
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,039
send those secret messages to

470
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
i'll be your friend

471
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,200
i will gladly be your friend and you

472
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,039
could send me secret messages oh my gosh

473
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,960
people should send me secret messages

474
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
that would be fun

475
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,840
anyways

476
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,960
we have our historical honorable

477
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,320
mentions

478
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,200
these are so fun they're not necessarily

479
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,360
cryptography but you could see a lot of

480
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,480
influence

481
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,160
into

482
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,039
cryptography based practices and stuff

483
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,000
that we see today

484
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,600
so first we will start off with

485
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
cleopatra

486
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,679
while technically steganography this was

487
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,240
a this is a very cute story

488
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,520
basically cleopatra cleopatra wanted to

489
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
see her love her safely so she wrapped

490
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,240
herself in a rug and sent it to him for

491
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,280
him to

492
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,840
literally

493
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,760
unwrap it wasn't really safe for her

494
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,679
there were a lot of people out to get

495
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,000
her historically speaking so

496
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
she needed just something to see her

497
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,760
lover with and

498
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,960
i thought that was pretty cool

499
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,559
next we have the zodiac cipher now it's

500
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,400
not associated with the

501
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,240
the other guy

502
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,960
but

503
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,360
the unaliver

504
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,799
but it is a 16-round feistel-based

505
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,120
structure with key whitening

506
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,000
the round function only uses exclusive

507
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,960
ores and substitution box lookups there

508
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,480
are two 8x8 big substitution boxes

509
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,720
one based with on the discrete

510
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,760
explanation 45 to the power of x and the

511
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,679
other using the multiplicative

512
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,159
multiplicative inverse in the finite

513
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,240
field which is

514
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,679
gallius field

515
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,799
multiplied by two to the power of eight

516
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,200
very confusing stuff i know

517
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,240
i could not find much on this subject

518
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,720
other than one small little wikipedia

519
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,919
article

520
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,120
but if anyone has more information or a

521
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,240
video or something on it i do prompt you

522
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,559
to send it to my email

523
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,799
at it's feed you it's speedjuice at

524
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,120
protonmail.com

525
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,520
and i would love to hear more about this

526
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,200
cicada 3301

527
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,960
now

528
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,200
i've done a lot of research on this i

529
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
will be uploading uh

530
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,799
a

531
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,480
research thing onto my github on my

532
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,120
extra studies so

533
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,799
soon so if you want to learn more about

534
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,400
cicada3301 i urge you to go check out my

535
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,039
github it's bee juice

536
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:07,919
and

537
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,919
there are three known puzzles of cicada

538
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,880
3301 but only two of them have ever been

539
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,000
solved

540
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,840
no one really knows who came up with

541
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,919
these puzzles or where they came from

542
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,240
but one thing is for certain whoever

543
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,280
makes them is really smart

544
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,360
from accusations of it being a cult

545
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,880
activity to the cia being behind it or

546
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,840
some form of cyber group controlling it

547
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,919
we may never know who's behind this

548
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,039
puzzle

549
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,200
but

550
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,679
they're smart and they have done a good

551
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,080
job in hiding their identity i respect

552
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,320
that

553
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
next is just a little fun like easter

554
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
egg that the developers from the united

555
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,679
states digital service put into their

556
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,000
source code so actually if you go into

557
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,320
the source code of the united states

558
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,360
digital service they have this lovely

559
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,760
crab i don't know if you all can see her

560
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,679
but her name is molly

561
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,240
and she is just the cutest little thing

562
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,280
she is an acai

563
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,080
a site sorry uh she's an

564
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,679
she's an image

565
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,440
made out of

566
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,840
letters and numbers

567
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
my apologies i forgot how to pronounce

568
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
that just now so

569
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
moving on

570
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,600
a lot of you may know this show it was

571
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,120
very popular it's called gravity falls

572
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,520
and honestly what would be

573
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,000
a cryptography talk without mentioning

574
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,440
gravity falls

575
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,760
let's be real especially mentioning like

576
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,279
children in our last slide

577
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,919
it's just you have to mention it

578
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,679
this show was loved by children and

579
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,679
adults alike i remember watching it for

580
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,159
the first time when it came out and i've

581
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,840
actually recently restarted watching it

582
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,919
this show is known to use the caesar

583
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,960
cipher the vegan air cipher at bash

584
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,120
cipher the a1z 26 cipher which is the

585
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
number to letter cipher we mentioned

586
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,919
earlier and more during the its time on

587
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,720
air

588
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
this show sparked the minds of many

589
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,960
young people and introduced a lot of

590
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,039
people to the world of cryptography in

591
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,840
an easy to understand and fun format

592
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,880
personally it's it's one of the things

593
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,360
that inspired me to start getting into

594
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,479
cryptography myself

595
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,279
next we have the

596
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,720
zodiac

597
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,600
analyzer

598
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,080
the zodiac cases are a series of cases

599
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,360
from northern california in the 1960s

600
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,200
about half of his ciphers remained

601
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,000
unsolved today and the others took over

602
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,039
50 years to crack i believe in 2020 they

603
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,799
just cracked

604
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,360
one of his ciphers

605
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,200
but they are

606
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,080
really hard to crack

607
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,880
and

608
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,080
for it being from the 60s

609
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,879
that's pretty good

610
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,320
while his actions were very unacceptable

611
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
and we don't know the true motives for

612
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,039
why he did what he did it would be impo

613
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,640
it would be improper to run a

614
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,039
cryptography talk without any mention of

615
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,400
his ciphers

616
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,200
i do not condone his actions and i do

617
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,320
not support whoever this person is

618
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,760
because we don't know who this person is

619
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,240
there are a couple people who we think

620
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,919
we know who they are

621
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,400
i don't condone his actions

622
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,440
or what he did but

623
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,080
his ciphers were pretty impressive i

624
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,799
will give him that

625
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,520
oh

626
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,039
okay great

627
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,760
so i hope you all enjoyed

628
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,960
i personally had fun i don't know about

629
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,400
you guys

630
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,000
if you ever need anything j or if you

631
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,480
would like to talk more or even teach me

632
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,880
something as i'm just a beginner you can

633
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,600
reach out to me on twitter

634
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,039
it's be juice linkedin which is my name

635
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,400
tori outlaw um but i also go by bee

636
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,640
so i would prefer if you all call me b

637
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
though but

638
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,559
you can still call me whatever or you

639
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,159
could just call me outlaw it's fine i

640
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,600
have a lot of friends i would love to

641
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,760
become friends with you all

642
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,240
uh github please check out my github

643
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,480
there's not a lot on it and a lot of

644
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,120
this stuff is pretty alright if i do say

645
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
so myself but

646
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,000
i post a lot of

647
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,720
extra stuff that i learned so i did some

648
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,080
research onto stuxnet and the i love you

649
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,039
computer virus a while back and i know

650
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,200
that i have oceans

651
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
notes on my github

652
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,880
so i think you all would actually

653
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,600
appreciate that if you enjoyed my talk

654
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,880
uh oh if you want to email me i do

655

protonmail.com

657
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,159
uh

658
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,159
let's see what else oh and of course

659
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,559
through digital overdose uh just ping me

660
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,880
in the server and ask to dm

661
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,360
and i'll get back to you on that

662
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,760
i would really like to thank our

663
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,480
members and our our mentors and the

664
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,799
brilliant staff that put together this

665
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,159
conference

666
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,640
uh you should come to the after party

667
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,159
and the ctf tournament because you know

668
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,600
i worked

669
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,880
i worked on that

670
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,000
so

671
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,760
i'm pretty proud of myself there's a lot

672
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,919
of cryptography in there

673
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,039
i only did cryptography on there um oh i

674
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,279
would like to thank our sponsors

675
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,320
uh without you guys it really would have

676
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
been impossible

677
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,679
