controller

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,680
i guess that's it without further ado

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,279
i'm gonna start down my own timer it's

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,920
gonna be three two one let's go all

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,199

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,558
so i'm gonna be starting off in the

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,559
office i need some far some coffee here

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,320
because we gotta get moving uh we gotta

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,360
watch out for these guys these are

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,160
flight earthers co-workers and

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,200
they're kind of the worst they'll drain

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
your stamina um i went ahead and printed

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,280
off a vulnerability report

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,800
earlier so i'm gonna need to grab that

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,559
from the media center so i'm just gonna

25
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,160
snag that real quick um

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,920
again form a little bit of coffee i

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,960
don't wanna get hit by these speech

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,120
bubbles just like that see um that's

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,559
going to reduce stamina it's going to

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,399
hurt me for time

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,520
that's all right though we'll make it

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,320
work

33
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,319
dodge these filing cabinets

34
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,960
there's some bad rng there

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,479
i'm going to listen to this conversation

36
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,439
a little bit it's going to slow me down

37
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,720
all right there it's done watch out for

38
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
this one

39
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,640
coming up on the box but normally you'll

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,080
be doing this run through a couple of

41
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
rooms to legitimize your report but we

42
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,080
ain't got time for that right

43
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,840
save the frames

44
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
grab some more coffee here um

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,320
i'm gonna risk getting coffee here from

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,439
this guy

47
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,720
here

48
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,400
i don't want to listen to your podcast

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,799
dude gotta get out of here i know season

50
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,840
two is when it kicks off all right we're

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,200
coming up on the final boss rooms this

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
is going to be a little tough i think i

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
have enough coffee to dodge most of the

54
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
golf balls i don't want to get hit by

55
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,159
too many of these geez all right

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,759
try to get up there and get hit a little

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,720
bit there i got to come in with the

58
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,399
vulnerability report to the side took

59
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,880
some bad hits there

60
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,079
yeah we're just gonna try to hit him

61
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,680
real quick and boom

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,000
all right he's pissed that's good

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,280
all right you did it uh you turned in

64
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,719
your vulnerability report to your boss

65
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,719
it was completely ignored flip server

66
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,079
will be compromised and you aren't sure

67
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,600
why even bothered

68
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,119
and i guess that's that's time for my

69
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,679
speed run

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
does this happen to you

71
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,520
this is becoming a more and more common

72
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,959
thing in workplaces and it's happened to

73
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,319
a lot of different people who work in

74
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,959
security and or even i.t

75
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,239
um they bring up a perfectly reasonable

76
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,319
vulnerability and recommendations to fix

77
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,000
it and they get ignored seemingly for no

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,599
good reason and

79
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,480

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,920
run into in the workplace and more and

101
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,599
more you're going to run into

102
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,720
times where you're going to want to

103
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,239
mitigate some sort of risk some sort of

104
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,800
vulnerability either as in a soccer role

105
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
or whatever the case may be

106
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,840
and

107
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,599
trying to bring that up to leadership

108
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,959
who's going to make the final decision

109
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,959
to expend resource on it and convince

110
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,400
them to do so

111
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
now who is this talk for well this talk

112
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,799
is for anyone who is in a information

113
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,200
security department and as an analyst

114
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,560
maybe in a sock

115
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,640
maybe they're just the sole person in

116
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,560
charge of security maybe

117
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
you know their upper management

118
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,080
themselves um

119
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,360
and it's for

120
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,959
those who even might even work as a

121
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,959
third party vendor just because this is

122
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,640
hack your boss if you're a security

123
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,319
vendor or part of a security vendor team

124
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,760
that doesn't mean that you can't get

125
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,120
something out of this the boss in this

126
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
context would be

127
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
your client you need to convince them to

128
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,640
execute on a

129
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,400
on a mitigation for risk

130
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,120
a little context uh i'm american

131
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
uh digital overdose is the international

132
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,920
community we have people from all over

133
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
which is great

134
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,239
but some of the things i might mention

135
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,239
in this talk are kind of based on an

136
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,840
american organization american

137
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,959
corporation so there's going to be some

138
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,159
cultural norms that are a little bit

139
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,360
different like

140
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
if i say how to approach somebody it may

141
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
not work in your culture but that

142
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,759
doesn't mean you can't get something out

143
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,199
of this talk

144
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,759
in the core of things people are very

145
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
much the same in terms of they have

146
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
feelings and thoughts and their own

147
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
drives and goals and that's the approach

148
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,919
you should take with this but i did want

149
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,199
to throw that out there you might have

150
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,880
to adapt some of these concepts to what

151
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,639
is acceptable in your workplace from

152
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,160
your part of the world

153
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,680
so what problem are we trying to solve

154
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,560
here

155
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,639
here's the scenario your role someone is

156
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,160
finding problems within an organization

157
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,759
from a security standpoint maybe it's

158
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,280
hardware maybe it's software that's out

159
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,960
of date needs to be patched new

160
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,520
vulnerability comes out hey it's log4j

161
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,880
again

162
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
you bring this information to your

163
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
manager your leadership and they just

164
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,520
dismiss you you're ignored

165
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,360
how does that make you feel

166
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,479
it might make you feel like you're not

167
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,639
listened to or take it seriously that

168
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,400
you wasted your time

169
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,919
it might make you feel as if leadership

170
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,440
of the decision makers have no idea what

171
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,360
they're doing that they don't care

172
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
but at the end of the day you try to

173
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
find some comfort somewhere maybe you

174
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,680
find comfort in the fact that knowing

175
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,000
that you're right

176
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,160
you're right about this or maybe further

177
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,720
still i'm right this is going to blow up

178
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,479
in their face and oh man you're gonna

179
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,000
watch it burn and you're gonna be the

180
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
one who told them so

181
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,680
but

182
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
i mean this isn't really why you took

183
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,720
that job right

184
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
just so you can get i told you so's all

185
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,520
day

186
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,960
this isn't a good way to run an

187
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,639
organization especially if you believe

188
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
in the goal

189
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,520
we shouldn't accept this as okay

190
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
and we shouldn't rest our laurels on it

191
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
either even if we feel it isn't our

192
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
fault or even if we feel it's not a

193
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,280
responsibility we told them what to do

194
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
and they didn't do it

195
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
when we are ignored as security

196
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,240
personnel

197
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,639
or technical personnel of any sort is it

198
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,560
our fault or is it their fault

199
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,319
well let's take the problem apart a

200
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,240
little bit first a little bit of history

201
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,680
let's go all the way back to the 90s

202
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,280
when organizations started having a

203
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,039
problem

204
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,319
uh with their uh when organizations

205
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,680
first started putting together i.t

206
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
departments

207
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,800
and that security departments might do

208
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,840
there wasn't really a cyber security

209
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,199
department at that point

210
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
they did so because technology was so

211
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,639
bewildering to them you're bringing in

212
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,479
pcs into the workplace and now they're

213
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,600
networked together and they need to

214
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
print stuff off it's all very

215
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
complicated they had no idea how the

216
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,639
internet worked how to install software

217
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,960
how to uninstall an operating system

218
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,560
so they formed i.t departments and these

219
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,080
it members were wizards they were

220
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
finally getting recognition for their

221
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,360
passion for tech when they were probably

222
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,960
shunned for a long time for not pursuing

223
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,600
something more mainstream

224
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
yeah keep in mind you have to know that

225
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
tech was a niche hobby back in the 80s

226
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,199
it wasn't mainstream

227
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,280
it was all about fast money and sales

228
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
and cars and their salesmen were the

229
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,360
workhorses of an organization that's how

230
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
you got things done

231
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,039
but now for businesses to move faster in

232
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,880
the internet's emergence tech geeks

233
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,280
became all-powerful all-knowing

234
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
and that meant they were complete

235
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,639
subject matter experts they could ask

236
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,080
for anything in order to keep machines

237
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,759
running and large organizations could

238
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,960
who could afford it would just simply

239
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
grant it to them here you go what we

240
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
need you need a new laptop

241
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
i guess so

242
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,639
here's more money for your fund

243
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,319
your i.t department had experts in the

244
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,680
authority over all technology and

245
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
getting things to function and that's

246
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
the way it was

247
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
this continued all the way to the 2000s

248
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,680
and 2010s because businesses kept adding

249
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,360
more complex systems and web

250
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
applications to their infrastructure

251
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
because they have to keep competitive

252
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,199
but this also led to some not so great

253
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
behavior i.t personnel and again cyber

254
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,520
security and information security was

255
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,039
born out of i.t so you can kind of

256
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,879
include this too started developing a

257
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,440
bad reputation in organizations

258
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,879
they acted annoyed by anybody who was

259
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,039
filing a ticket they did gatekeeping by

260
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,479
choosing not to explain what they did

261
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,240
and kept responsibilities for things for

262
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,919
themselves citing that others would just

263
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,680
mess it up

264
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,919
why did this behavior occur

265
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,039
what happened

266
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,400
you know i once had a professor of

267
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
information technology tell me if you

268
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,639
set a system up right in the right way

269
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,919
you shouldn't have to work more than a

270
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,280
few hours a week you can just sit back

271
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
and let things take care of themselves

272
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,560
and that was the sentiment i found more

273
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,879
and more when working with corporations

274
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,960
this was not only a poor

275
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,800
way of setting up poor expectations for

276
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
how systems should be ran but how

277
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
personnel should be expected to go in

278
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
through their day

279
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
if anyone interrupted their downtime or

280
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,640
a major project they were more

281
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,919
interested in working on with something

282
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,599
trivial or simple

283
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,799
then they would handle it with less

284
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,880
grace like this guy right here the toxic

285
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
i.t member

286
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,598
all right let's get out of here

287
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,800
so this continued on

288
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
all the way into the 2010s and that's

289
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,000
when things kind of started to change we

290
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,920
started having this paradigm shift

291
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
security concerns increased and

292
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
continued to evolve it wasn't just

293
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,320
putting together

294
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,040
servers or rebuilding computers or

295
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
recovering passwords now they were

296
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,720
defending and that's where cyber

297
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,920
security and information security

298
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
departments they were born out of this

299
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
they're often former or current it

300
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
members and they

301
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,760
were still viewed as just another

302
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,320
department you know like i.t like hr

303
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
like marketing yep here's the cyber

304
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,880
security department we'll just attach

305
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,320
that to the organization we'll continue

306
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,920
doing what we do

307
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
they'll just take care of their part

308
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,760
effective security doesn't work like

309
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
that though and we all know that it

310
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
should be a cultural thing that everyone

311
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,560
is aware of because everyone is a target

312
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
for attackers

313
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,839
but we're not quite there yet

314
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,440
organizations quite haven't caught up to

315
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,800
that or

316
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,160
traditional organizations haven't quite

317
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,839
caught up to that

318
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,440
now we have essentially an i.t

319
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,959
department and an information security

320
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,160
department

321
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,200
and

322
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
more and more these requests get sent to

323
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,959
leadership and they're told no

324
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,320
just no

325
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,160
it's because leadership and management

326
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,399
has gotten tech savvier and

327
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,000
they've been burned in the past i've

328
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,839
seen a technology department holding

329
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,519
seven thousand dollar software license

330
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,200
that they had petitioned for but they

331
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,880
never deployed it because they quote

332
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
didn't have the resources for it

333
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
which what that means was that they just

334
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,240
didn't follow up with it they needed a

335
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
few more people and they well they just

336
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,200
didn't ask

337
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
and they sat on that for several years

338
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,560
until the license completely expired and

339
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,519
that damaged their reputation

340
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
now we have new people entering the

341
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,440
cyber security space information

342
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,959
technology space

343
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,560
and they're battling a new uphill battle

344
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,480
for legitimacy

345
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,839
in a lot of

346
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,279
places there isn't that established

347
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,680
rapport between management and some of

348
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,760
the departments they manage

349
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,079
and it's a non-working solution and

350
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,000
that's going to lead to well more

351
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,120
problems

352
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,519
a lot more problems

353
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,440
so what can we do

354
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,640
well we need to accept a hard truth

355
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,959
in order to get something done

356
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,480
being right

357
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,920
is not enough

358
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
and for analytical people such as us who

359
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,360
are drawn to technology

360
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
this is super frustrating

361
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,640
i'm right

362
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,399
what more do you need

363
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,760
but you have to accept this if you're

364
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,839
going to get anything actually done

365
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,279
you have to be more than just right

366
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,720
about something

367
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,800
so what can we do let's do a little

368
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
social hacking

369
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,079
first we're gonna pick up our

370
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,680
vulnerability report and that's gonna be

371
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,120
like our payload this is what we need to

372
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,240
convince people to do something

373
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,560
and we need to convince a decision maker

374
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,839
that might be a leadership might be a

375
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,200
direct boss whatever the case may be

376
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,519
maybe even a colleague to execute this

377
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,519
payload execute our mitigation

378
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,839
vulnerability

379
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,040
their preconceived notions their

380
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,680
prejudices their past disappointments

381
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
well they're acting as our security

382
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,800
control and we're going to use

383
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
psychology and other techniques that

384
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,480
i've learned through years of working

385
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
with leadership and organizations to

386
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
deliver this payload

387
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,519
so let's start with what not to do and

388
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,200
this is very important

389
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,160
first

390
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,240
gas lighting

391
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
this is not a penetration testing

392
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,800
engagement

393
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
where any of the tools are the trade are

394
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,160
fair game

395
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,519
as long as they're disclosing the rules

396
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,040
of engagement

397
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,800
this is your workplace

398
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
you have to work with these people and

399
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,720
doing things like convincing others that

400
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,079
something isn't true to meet your own

401
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,040
ends is straight up and moral

402
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
eventually people are going to figure

403
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,240
out what you're doing anyways and then

404
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,720
they're not going to listen to you

405
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,639
to further drive this point home

406
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,959
don't lie

407
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,160
you're gonna have to answer some hard

408
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,639
questions sometimes that will actually

409
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,279
hurt your argument to get something done

410
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,560
however

411
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,079
lies have a high probability coming back

412
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,440
to burn you

413
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,760
and the cost is damaging your reputation

414
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,040
and a lot of times that can't be

415
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,600
repaired so now that we have that out of

416
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,680
the way what is the approach

417
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,800
well just like any other hacking

418
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
engagement we're going to do a little

419
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,399
recon and scanning

420
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,320
you need to ask yourself some questions

421
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,360
about the person you're trying to

422
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
convince do something be your manager or

423
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
another team member

424
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,440
how well do you know them

425
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,680
how well do you know their boss

426
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
what does their role entail

427
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,639
what's the structure of your

428
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,000
organization different roles and

429
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,560
responsibility who's handling what

430
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,680
when's the last time you had a

431
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
conversation about what their day-to-day

432
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,040
was like

433
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,320
almost everyone in the workplace has

434
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,519
their own goals they have their own

435
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,880
obligations

436
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,959
and they have to complete and execute

437
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,720
so you need to find those out and see

438
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
what drives them

439
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,760
next

440
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,920
we need gaining access

441
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
now the stage probably requires the most

442
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,800
amount of prep you need to be able to

443
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
understand the person you are trying to

444
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,880
get to make changes however unlike a

445
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,480
normal hack where you have multiples of

446
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
opportunity to exploit sometimes you

447
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,760
only get one opportunity to convince the

448
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,519
decision maker to take action you want

449
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,920
them to take so preparation is key

450
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,279
you'll need to learn to

451
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,800
sell your idea

452
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,120
again being right is not enough

453
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,199
you have to be able to explain why it's

454
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,360
a good expenditure of resources and time

455
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
to fix this vulnerability or adopt a new

456
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,279
software solution whatever the case may

457
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,079
be

458
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,279
in other words

459
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,800
you have to sell it

460
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
you spent all that time reconning and

461
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,639
scanning that person because you need to

462
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,240
know what's important to that decision

463
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
maker

464
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,440
does this serve any other goals if it

465
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,519
does then you have to show them how it

466
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,720
does serve that goal or if it doesn't

467
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,079
you have to show them how it serves the

468
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,079
overall goal and mission of the

469
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,240
organization you work for

470
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,000
this is where risk management and risk

471
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,440
assessment comes in it's a discipline

472
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,199
you should have some grip over if not

473
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,320
because as much mastery over as you can

474
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,839
if you're doing something for compliance

475
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,839
reasons then all the better

476
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,800
but you need to go into that

477
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,160
conversation as more than just the

478
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,399
subject matter expert of technology you

479
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,480
have to be able to explain to them on

480
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
their terms why some action needs to be

481
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
taken and how it benefits everyone

482
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,560
now if you've been job hunting in the

483
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
security field lately you might be

484
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
seeing a common qualification that's

485
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,000
been coming up and it is going to be

486
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,680
something like this being able to

487
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,639
explain complex ideas at all levels

488
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,680
you have to be able to make sure a

489
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,079
person that's making the decision feels

490
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,680
confident that they're understanding

491
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,760
what they're deciding do not fall into

492
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,399
the trap the very old trap of trying to

493
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,519
stymie someone into trusting others

494
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,279
by using confusing concepts and

495
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,440
terminology they aren't familiar with

496
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,120
you're not helping yourself by doing

497
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,440
this it makes them feel dumb and feel

498
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,320
bad

499
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,079
and they're gonna want to interact with

500
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,320
you less and less

501
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
learn to put together a presentation

502
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,160
especially if it's a large proposal

503
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,079
but regardless of the size of that you

504
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,680
should ask yourself

505
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,560
or

506
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
do when there's a few things you need to

507
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
kind of ask yourself about that

508
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,160
presentation about that

509
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
uh mitigation that you're proposing

510
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,480
before you go in there

511
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,759
first

512
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,240
what is the likelihood of it occurring

513
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
now this isn't an easy question to

514
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
answer in a lot of cases especially if

515
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,079
it's a new zero day that's come out

516
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,920
but there's some things you can take

517
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
into consideration

518
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,560
um how visible is the asset in question

519
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
you know is it a web server or is it

520
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,240
something on your back end

521
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,399
how publicized is a vulnerability is it

522
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,680
making the rounds in all sorts of

523
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,000
publications that could be used as

524
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
as a reason like hey this is becoming

525
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,199
more and more aware so people are going

526
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,680
to start looking at uh our organization

527
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
as a possible target especially advanced

528
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,480
persistent threats

529
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,079
are other organizations doing something

530
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,440
like putting together an open response

531
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,279
to how they're handling it i remember

532
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,279
plenty of you know published things like

533
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,839
here's how we're handling again log 4j

534
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,839
uh in our organization does it affect

535
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,120
you does it affect your product that we

536
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,360
release to you

537
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
ask yourself what the impact of that

538
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
vulnerability is now it's important to

539
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,560
be realistic here

540
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,880
if you over exaggerate you're going back

541
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,560
to not being honest

542
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,440
and that's going to damage your

543
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,959
reputation for someone as viewed as the

544
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,240
sky is always falling they're going to

545
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,839
get us everything's going to be lost and

546
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,839
it's going to be your fault

547
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,279
he also doesn't need to think about

548
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,800
impact on the other end of the spectrum

549
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,959
what sort of impact is your solution

550
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,320
going to have could it cause some

551
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,000
downtime could it break some things that

552
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,680
are functioning currently what would

553
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,959
that look like

554
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,279
what's this going to cost

555
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,120
if you're proposing a solution you need

556
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,720
to have a realistic idea of what it's

557
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,639
going to cost take some time to think

558
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,600
about it

559
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,040
this is more than just money this is

560
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
also your time

561
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,399
other people's time

562
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,079
you know software resources or other

563
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,679
departments need to be brought in

564
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,959
have a good idea of what it's going to

565
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,720
take

566
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,000
and

567
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,439
ask yourself do i actually have a

568
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,599
solution now this is a surprising mess

569
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,119
for a lot of people don't get caught off

570
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,520
guard with uh out some sort of solution

571
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,959
in mind when you go to speak with

572
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,000
somebody

573
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,439
if you're the security professional

574
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,119
you're the subject matter expert you're

575
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,319
in charge of coming up with a solution

576
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,679
most of the time

577
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,919
if you aren't sure what to do or it's

578
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,360
time sensitive and you're just

579
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,160
disclosing the the vulnerability for the

580
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
sake of awareness then come up with a

581
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,919
plan to find a solution and that's what

582
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,280
you're going to go into that meeting

583
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
with

584
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
we have this problem we don't have an

585
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
immediate solution this is what i'm

586
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,600
doing to find that solution

587
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,679
ask for resources ask for a meeting ask

588
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,120
for time to come up with something if

589
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,200
you need more time and have a scheduled

590
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,440
time to update those decision makers so

591
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,120
they know currently what's going on

592
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,720
never ever go into a meeting or

593
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
conversation with somebody about an

594
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,160
issue without a plan to do something

595
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,880
about it

596
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,039
finally uh not mentioned here think of

597
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,360
reasons why they might say no now if

598
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,440
you've done your recon and scanning then

599
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,039
you probably have an idea of why they

600
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,440
might go for it or might not go for it

601
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,520
have counterpoints ready

602
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,200
if you can't counter something right

603
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,520
then because of lacking information

604
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,000
admit that you don't know that's okay

605
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,080
it's okay to say you don't know

606
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,160
but follow that up with but i'm going to

607
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,600
find out

608
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,160
and that's really hard to argue against

609
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,679
now if you can't counter someone's

610
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,799
objections

611
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,960
then maybe they're right

612
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,720
you should really rethink exactly what

613
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
you're proposing and maybe you need to

614
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,360
spend some time reworking it

615
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,600
and keep in mind this isn't a contest

616
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,280
this is a conversation

617
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,720
so come into it with that mindset

618
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,360
maintaining persistence

619
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,440
you maintain persistence with leadership

620
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,039
and decision makers

621
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,280
by being consistent with your approach

622
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,600
because if you're persistent with things

623
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
and consistent they're gonna learn to

624
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,120
trust your abilities and capabilities

625
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,960
this is just forming trust this is about

626
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,400
forming a consistent working

627
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,720
relationship to the point where after a

628
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,880
while they're gonna not need big long

629
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,640
meetings on things they just know that

630
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,840
hey listen

631
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,679
they're here they haven't steered us

632
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
wrong in the past they will communicate

633
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,120
to us when something's aware that we

634
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,960
need to be aware of and they'll ask for

635
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,679
resources when they need it i trust them

636
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,520
go do what you need to do

637
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,039
you'll spend less time doing meetings

638
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,360
convincing people if you're consistent

639
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
that's maintaining persistence in this

640
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
way

641
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,600
now

642
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,039
this is an important one you also need

643
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,799
to know when to walk away

644
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,200
after the pandemic

645
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,160
this new wave of work reform has

646
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,520
happened and it's i think it's pretty

647
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,480
great people have taken time to stop and

648
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,760
have a break from their workplace

649
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,480
because of quarantine and really think

650
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,559
is this really what i want to do do i

651
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,080
want to be in this working relationship

652
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
with this organization

653
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,240
and then realizing that it hasn't been

654
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,679
working for them and it hasn't really

655
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,039
worked for them in a long time and

656
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,640
they're miserable so that's why we're

657
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
seeing this shift between different

658
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,760
careers

659
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,159
and moving into different fields and

660
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,840
it's great

661
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,799
now

662
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,240
if you're in an organization and you're

663
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,320
running into a brick wall

664
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,159
maybe you're not being taken seriously

665
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,120
or

666
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,559
you're being ignored despite your best

667
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,000
efforts

668
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,360
maybe you really don't respect

669
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,640
leadership

670
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,440
maybe

671
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,520
you feel they don't respect you either

672
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,440
then all these efforts that i'm talking

673
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
about today they're not going to work

674
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,679
you need to find someplace else to be

675
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,360
because this isn't going to get any

676
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,200
better it's not

677
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,440
don't suffer under toxic people who you

678
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,280
can't work with it should be a mutual

679
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
relationship it doesn't matter if you're

680
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
a subordinate role

681
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,679
just because they make decisions doesn't

682
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,200
mean that your role is any less you're

683
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,840
the one who executes on

684
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,039
that they should be able to recognize

685
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,480
that you're an asset if you're coming to

686
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,240
them with something professional

687
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,080
and put together and there's still

688
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
resistance to you

689
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
then you know for sure it has nothing to

690
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
do with you

691
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,320
or your work

692
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,240
and it's time to walk away and maybe

693
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,880
find another exit

694
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,159
life's too short to put up with people

695
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,480
who won't work with you

696
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,520
now

697
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,039
we do need to be more than just subject

698
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,960
matter experts we need to communicate

699
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,159
effectively

700
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,000
and it isn't easy because people aren't

701
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
consistent you have to take some time to

702
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
understand the human systems within your

703
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
organization not just the technical

704
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,440
systems you need to do this in order to

705
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,280
get anything actually done

706
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,120
soft skills are not going away from

707
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,640
information security in fact they are

708
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,400
more and more valued and more and more

709
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,520
visible

710
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,000
the old guard of information security

711
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,960
and i.t

712
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,039
who have senior roles should not be

713
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,320
teaching the next generation of

714
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,559
employees that their role is to deal

715
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,640
with annoying tickets and to make people

716
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
and people who make mistakes are

717
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
adversaries for your harmonious

718
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,360
workplace

719
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,480
this sort of toxic idea has to die off

720
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,919
this world is no longer the domain of

721
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,000
those who can set it forget it it is a

722
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,600
war zone out there

723
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,360
the internet

724
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,559
is uh

725
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,720
everybody's a fair game target

726
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,240
and lording superiority mindset is

727
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,960
counterproductive security so some final

728
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,720
takeaways from this talk

729
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,080
first

730
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,280
don't assume stupidity

731
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,520
we all have our skill set

732
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,679
and yes i think most people who come

733
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,440
into this conference and who are into

734
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,400
tech

735
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,720
are often in the role of family tech

736
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,799
support

737
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,640
and while we we might get really annoyed

738
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,240
with our family members or even our

739
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,600
close friends who come to say hey this

740
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
is broken would you fix it and it's

741
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,360
something so simple and you kind of roll

742
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,520
your eyes and rub your forehead you

743
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,840
still don't treat them poorly at least

744
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
you shouldn't

745
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
that shouldn't be something that's just

746
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,760
relegated to those who are close to you

747
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,600
when you have another colleague or

748
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,520
somebody who's

749
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,960
emailing you like hey i got this

750
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,760
suspicious email and i clicked on it

751
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
they already feel really bad about it

752
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,679
nobody likes to feel dumb and nobody

753
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,360
likes to feel like they got taken

754
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,200
advantage of and then they have to go to

755
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,640
you

756
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,799
and explain that they did something that

757
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,679
in hindsight was really kind of foolish

758
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,360
that doesn't feel good you wouldn't want

759
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,200
to have to go and do that with somebody

760
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,799
else on something you're not familiar

761
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,559
with everybody's got their talents and

762
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,400
skills yes

763
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,240
they did something foolish but let's not

764
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,080
just assume that they're dumb that has

765
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,000
to die

766
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,360
you also need to recognize toxic

767
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
behavior

768
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
you're gonna have colleagues who still

769
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,440
have a lot of old-world way of thinking

770
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,679
hey uh you know oh look at this ticket

771
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,039
come over here and you kind of have a

772
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,640
laugh about it yeah i get it it's

773
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,320
probably a little funny

774
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,600
but

775
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,760
that kind of talk just perpetuates a bad

776
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,679
stereotype of i.t

777
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,720
and information security by extension

778
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,159
they're very much hand in hand because

779
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,159
one was kind of born out of the other

780
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,919
i would like to see cyber security in

781
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,880
the future not be something that is

782
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,360
an extension or a rebranding of the old

783
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,679
world information technology

784
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,440
where security members are very

785
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,840
approachable because we need to be

786
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,559
because security

787
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,240
and that anybody who does have a problem

788
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
or concern even if it's something small

789
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,480
can be approached they feel safe they

790
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,240
feel reassured

791
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,159
we're essentially the the guardians of

792
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,600
our networks and the guardians of our

793
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,039
assets so

794
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,720
while we want to try to be eyes and ears

795
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,360
using our you know our seam software

796
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
maybe running queries and splunk

797
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
no we all know that users are a big

798
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,039
vulnerability and they're going to get

799
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,720
taken advantage of

800
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,919
through phishing emails so make sure

801
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,440
that you're approachable

802
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,360
remember that empathy is the best social

803
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,760
hacking tool ever and probably ever will

804
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,000
be if you understand somebody you're

805
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,520
going to be able to approach them and

806
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,679
know what they find is important and

807
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,240
know how to reach out to them

808
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,080
how we treat people at all levels

809
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,520
regardless of its leadership or

810
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,799
management which is the focus of this

811
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,559
talk even if you're dealing with a

812
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,080
colleague or somebody who's you know

813
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,760
maybe lower in the totem pole

814
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,679
that information bubbles up to their

815
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,039
leaders in management and they're going

816
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,720
to view a very necessary group of

817
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,600
security as extremely toxic

818
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,120
and this overall reduces your visibility

819
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,880
on the network and you're just as much

820
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,720
target as your web server and so are

821
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,840
they

822
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,120
they're not going to come and help you

823
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,279
uh when they need help

824
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,279
so i do want to go ahead and thank

825
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,880

842
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,000
game be downloadable to play um i'm

843
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
still back and forth on that so

844
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,520
we're gonna go with maybe it's not a

845
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,679
definite no okay all right good to know

846
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,880
good to know um this was very spicy

847
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,640
uh nicos i believe there was another

848
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,320
question from twitch

849
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,559
there was uh so on twitch uh people

850
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,159
asked how long did it take you to make

851
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,640
this presentation

852
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,159
okay so it's funny little sidebar i'm

853
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,080
like i'm sitting and i'm like there's

854
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,000
gonna be a qa section at the end it's

855
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,120
probably gonna be a lot about the game

856
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,000
um

857
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,200
so i've been

858
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
uh so i i didn't build this from scratch

859
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,880
because

860
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,320
i knew that was gonna take way too long

861
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,000
they're like i'll start in c plus this

862
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,240
is actually built with a game engine uh

863
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,520
helping me out so all the animation

864
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,039
engines and the collision shapes and all

865
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,720
that stuff is already set and it's used

866
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,679
in uh uh it's godot and then i i used

867
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,120
their their native language which is

868
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,880
python like which is great um called gd

869
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,120
script uh so

870
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,279
i did all my art assets of course uh it

871
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,120
took me

872
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,320
it took me about a week to put it

873
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,919
together

874
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,840
maybe a little longer

875
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,600
because there's lots of crashing and i

876
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,840
kept having to pull away from like oh

877
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,760
and i'll make the the co-workers chase

878
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
you and knock coffee out of you and you

879
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,120
have to go pick it up and like no what's

880
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,840
not

881
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,620
let's not do that

882
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,679
[Laughter]

883
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,360
i think one of the main reasons why

884
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,320
there's questions on like the game and

885
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,039
not on the talk is uh what someone said

886
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,120
which is that you know

887
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,039
it's gamification with a story in a

888
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,279
presentation it's an awesome talk

889
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,200
it's just uh like

890
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
there's nothing to have questions about

891
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,640
like

892
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,000
self-contained

893
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,480
it was it was really good i didn't have

894
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
one in twitch though

895
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,840
if that's all right

896
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,360
yeah

897
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,640
so uh

898
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,799
the thumpy said how long does it take to

899
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,399
write a script for a presentation like

900
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,159
this this was really informative and

901
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,120
understandable even for a beginner

902
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,039
um

903
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,120
i've i do

904
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,159
some side hustling public speaking uh

905
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,640
actually perform weddings so i'm used to

906
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,120
writing down presentations and stuff i

907
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,360
i want to say like writing it down

908
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,440
it takes me like a few hours and then i

909
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,200
go back through and maybe make a couple

910
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,760
edits but really i'm writing things over

911
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,399
and over again in my head

912
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,840
usually like you know those shower

913
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,279
thoughts that you have where i'm driving

914
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,039
or something like that i am constantly

915
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,399
thinking about what do i want to say

916
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,760
when do i want to say it what are the

917
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,080
points i want to bring up so

918
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,880
i'm as soon as i i chose a topic for

919
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,640
this talk i think i was working on it in

920
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
my head until i got it down to its final

921
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,080
form and even like a few minutes

922
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,760
beforehand i read a few things i'm like

923
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,640
i'm gonna change that real quick so

924
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,880
uh pretty much since the announced that

925
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,799
what my title what the title of my talk

926
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,919
was going to be i was working on this

927
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,360
damn

928
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,200
yeah

929
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,520
we've had

930
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,279
nikos we have another one in the twitch

931
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,000
chat

932
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
okay so

933
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
sure uh how widespread do you think uh

934
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,000
co-worker interruption animosity is or

935
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,679
is that just an urban myth

936
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,159
i i still see it in fact if you

937
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,360
you could probably still dig through

938
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,520
reddit and and see plenty of horror

939
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,240
stories from mit um

940
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,320
even my my significant other it

941
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,960
experiences it at work that

942
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,039
that annoyed tone that uh somebody's

943
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,200
coming in like what did you do

944
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,600
did you do this and just

945
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,440
it's unfortunately still there it's very

946
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,679
prevalent and i thought it would go away

947
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,360
over time like well you know that's just

948
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,880
kind of old-school thinking and people

949
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,640
are becoming more aware and we're

950
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,159
becoming more socially sensitive which

951
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,399
is great we're we're using empathy we're

952
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,799
realizing toxicity and trying to get

953
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,640
through that but it is still pretty big

954
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,159
out there and we still have to work on

955
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,720
our soft skills uh at all levels either

956
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,559
dealing with small things or doing a big

957
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,559
presentation
