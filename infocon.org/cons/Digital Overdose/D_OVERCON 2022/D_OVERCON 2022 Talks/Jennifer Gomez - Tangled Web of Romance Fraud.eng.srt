fraud cases but i've had the opportunity

to work on some very interesting other

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,279
types of fraud such as romance fraud

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,039
so today i'm going to talk about romance

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,720
fraud and it's recently been gaining a

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
lot of attention it has a lot of people

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,560
asking the question what is romance

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,560
fraud

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,399
so well okay

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,600
sorry

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,120
today i'm going to take you on a journey

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,960
of romance fraud from beginning to end

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,559
we're going to discuss all the stages of

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,039
the fraud what preventative steps can be

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,360
taken to avoid falling victim to romance

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,160
fraud and how romance fraud can affect

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,000
your company's brand and reputation

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
so as i mentioned there's been a lot of

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,640
attention on romance fraud with

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,559
documentaries popping up on several

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,480
different networks such as netflix

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,438
showtime national geographic and that's

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,880
just to name a few there's several

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,040
others out there some of them showcase

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,200
in real life romance fraud where the

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,960
target actually meets the fraudster in

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,000
person

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,759
they build a relationship sometimes they

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,159
even get engaged or get married and the

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,920
other type is where you get to take a

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,520
look at the romance fraud from the mind

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,720
of the criminal

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,560
now on this slide i've highlighted three

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,040
of my favorite documentaries on romance

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,000
fraud

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
if you haven't seen them you should

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,159
check them out

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,240
so i'd like to start with the definition

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,720
what is romance fraud

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
romance fraud is a fraudulent scheme in

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
which a threat actor pretends to have a

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
romantic interest in a target

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,799
establishes a relationship and then

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,720
attempts to collect money or sensitive

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
information from the target under false

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
pretenses

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
so next we're going to take a look at

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,600
the fbi's internet crimes annual report

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,640
data as you can see here

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,960
this has grown significantly over the

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,799
past few years

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
with 2021 accounting for over one oh

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,799
just under 1 billion dollars in

58
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,440
financial loss which is approximately

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,038
thirty nine thousand dollars per

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,679
individual

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
so as you know as you can see and this

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,160
is just what's reported because as with

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
a lot of fraud

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
it's not always reported sometimes

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,879
people are embarrassed or ashamed that

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,560
they felt victim to the fraud or they

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,920
just think it's not going to matter

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
anyhow it they're not going to get their

69
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
money back or you know it's not worth

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,680
their time but whatever the mat whatever

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
the reason is that they don't report it

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,480
either way these numbers are staggering

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,360
so next we're going to take a look at

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,959
the stages that i've identified in my

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,840
investigations

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
so it starts with that developing a

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,959
persona

78
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,879
who they want to be this time picking a

79
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,959
career creating their social media

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,040
presence selecting the images they want

81
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,959
to use and then they develop their story

82
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,360
then they go live

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
they look for their target on social

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
media sites maybe dating sites possibly

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
looking for individuals with profiles

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
that say that they're divorced or

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
widowed and once they identify their

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,200
target

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
they send a message

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,319
and they just wait for a response

91
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,159
once they've connected they try to get

92
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,519
to know their victim they want to learn

93
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,360
as much as possible retaining any

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
information that can be leveraged later

95
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,920
on

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
they try to get they try to start the

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
relationship and build a trust with

98
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
their victim

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,080
let me tell their story lie after lie

100
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,560
possibly a sob story about their family

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,720
or losing their partner tragically

102
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,080
whatever they think will gain the

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,799
sympathy of their victim

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,159
once the relationship has been

105
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,080
established and the trust has been

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,720
established the financial requests begin

107
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
and they're always extremely urgent

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,200
usually they start small

109
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
and if their victim starts to make the

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,959
payments then they increase in value and

111
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,480
the actor will do whatever it takes to

112
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,000
convince the victim to come up with this

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,439
money

114
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,680
so the victim does whatever it takes

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,439
pulls to pull this money together to

116
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,000
make these payments

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,239
and at some point the victim does begin

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,920
to doubt the requests being made they

119
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
start asking more and more questions

120
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,760
they start searching for answers answers

121
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,000
which usually will lead to the discovery

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,720
of the fraud

123
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
so as i told you in the beginning i'm

124
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
going to take you on the journey of a

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,840
romance fraud case from beginning to end

126
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,600
this is an investigation i recently

127
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
worked and it gave us a lot of

128
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,199
information about how the fraud is

129
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,560
carried out

130
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
it also shows us how quickly this type

131
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,639
of fraud progresses because it takes

132
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,720
place within a time frame of just under

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,479
two months

134
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,840
so now we're going to take a look at the

135
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
involved parties

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,560
the actor was a wealthy american widower

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
who was an engineer working on a project

138
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,840
overseas

139
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,520
he claimed that he had two children

140
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,600
still living in the u.s but no other

141
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,880
family

142
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,800
the victim was a recently divorced

143
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
individual who was seeking a

144
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,440
relationship online

145
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,400
so our story begins with a connection

146
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
made on social media the conversation

147
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
begins with small talk it's exactly what

148
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,919
you would expect of two people who are

149
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,080
just getting to know one another however

150
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,720
the infatuation builds very quickly

151
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,080
and you start to see the actors saying

152
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
things like i think you're the one for

153
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,840
me or that they hope that this develops

154
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,080
into a serious relationship

155
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,320
now it only takes one day but several

156
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
hours of conversation but just one day

157
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,639
for the actor to claim to be falling in

158
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,320
love with the victim

159
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
and the victim does seem very receptive

160
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,919
to the actors advances and compliments

161
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,000
but shows that they're a bit reserved

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,520
and guarded

163
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,479
because they don't want to be heard

164
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,639
again

165
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,720
the actor uses all of this information

166
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
to further guide the conversation

167
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,120
and gain the trust of their victim

168
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
so the conversation continues for a few

169
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,360
more days and at this point they're both

170
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
proclaiming their love for one another

171
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
they're discussing their future plans to

172
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,039
be married where they're going to live

173
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,560
what a wonderful life and a beautiful

174
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
family they're going to have together

175
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
at one point you see there's a shift in

176
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,800
the conversation from mine to hours and

177
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,880
finally they begin discussing sharing

178
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
finances and who's going to pay the

179
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
bills once they get married now this is

180
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,160
only day two of their conversations

181
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,240
a couple more days pass by

182
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
and you see another change in the

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,240
conversation the courtship phase has

184
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,479
ended and they now are in a full-blown

185
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,720
relationship and at this point the two

186
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,759
have only been talking for four days

187
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,600
shortly thereafter the first financial

188
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
request comes in and of course it's

189
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,560
extremely urgent

190
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,400
there's an emergency that requires a

191
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,240
payment and the actors having banking

192
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
issues

193
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,840
now remember the actor is wealthy

194
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,319
however the actors having trouble

195
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,759
accessing their funds because of the

196
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,400
location that they're working on the

197
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
actor assures the victim the money would

198
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,319
be paid back by the end of the month

199
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,240
this victim is not in a position to be

200
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,560
helping out anyone financially but the

201
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,960
victim borrows money from family to make

202
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
the payment

203
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,919
this continues on and on and the

204
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,759
financial requests come in and each one

205
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,880
is greater than the last

206
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,440
so you might ask yourself how does this

207
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,599
progress so quickly how does this happen

208
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520
well these actors are masters of their

209
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,240
craft they find ways to convince the

210
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
victim how much adoration they have for

211
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,479
them they make them feel special and

212
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,639
safe they use endearing terms like honey

213
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,120
darling my love sweetie

214
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
they make them feel safe and secure it's

215
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,520
all part of their grooming process once

216
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
they have their victim hooked that's

217
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
when the conversation begins to change

218
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,639
and the actor shifts gears into the

219
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,560
financial requests

220
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
once the money starts coming in a new

221
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
urgent situation will arise every couple

222
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,120
of days

223
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,879
when the victim does become suspicious

224
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,639
or ask for something to reassure them

225
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,479
that this is a legitimate relationship

226
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,520
or

227
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,919
a real person the actor will provide

228
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,319
family photos pictures of themselves at

229
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,879
work or at restaurants or even exploring

230
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,879
in the country that they're working in

231
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,879
all in an attempt to prove to the victim

232
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,879
that they are who they say they are if

233
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,919
the victim

234
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,240
continues to be suspicious of the

235
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
financial requests that are coming in or

236
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
asks for some sort of tangible proof

237
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
that some money is due

238
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,160
the actor will provide falsified

239
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,240
documents or bills whatever the victim

240
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,080
is asking for whatever it's going to

241
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,720
take to continue this fraud

242
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,560
finally after almost two months the

243
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,879
victim began to investigate calling all

244
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,639
the places that the payments were going

245
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,599
to

246
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,280
gathering as much information as

247
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,039
possible and finally reached out to our

248
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,039
company to see if the actor was an

249
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,958
employee working on a project

250
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,399
so once we confirmed that this was not

251
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,399
an employee of our company nor had they

252
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,279
ever been the realization set in for the

253
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,880
victim that they had been defrauded

254
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,120
the embarrassment there was fear and

255
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
panic that now i'm going to be stuck

256
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,519
with all of this debt

257
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
and it was really unfortunate for this

258
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,560
victim because

259
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,200
this victim did have the instinct to do

260
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,959
research and investigate but it just

261
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,519
came too late it was after the victim

262
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,959
had already incurred a significant

263
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,959
financial loss of tens of thousands of

264
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,359
dollars

265
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,839
so most people think i would never fall

266
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,760
for this it could never happen to me

267
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,839
victim shaming happens all too often in

268
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,200
this arena

269
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,160
but this victim did question everything

270
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,080
this victim appeared to be very

271
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,800
intelligent and logical asking all the

272
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,040
right questions

273
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,760
but remember this is what the actor does

274
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
they purposely seek out individuals who

275
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
are emotionally vulnerable they use a

276
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,399
very high pressure tactic

277
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,800
matters of extreme urgency if this

278
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,080
payment isn't received something

279
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,399
catastrophic is going to happen

280
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
they don't give the victim time to think

281
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,279
or make logical or informed decisions it

282
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,680
has to happen now

283
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
another tactic used by the actor is

284
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,640
guilt

285
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
if you don't make this payment and this

286
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,600
catastrophic event happens

287
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
can you live with that it'll be your

288
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,160
fault

289
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,920
so with these different tactics the

290
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,839
actors able to convince the victim over

291
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,120
and over again

292
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,240
to make the payments

293
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
the victim as i said was not in a

294
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
financial position to help anyone out

295
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
but this this victim borrowed money from

296
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
family took out bank loans

297
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
used money intended to pay their own

298
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,279
bills and support their own family all

299
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,440
in order to pay the requests that were

300
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,839
being made by the actor all along going

301
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,000
further and further into debt

302
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,519
to help the person that they thought

303
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,880
they loved that they thought they were

304
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
going to be married to

305
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,399
all with the assurance that they were

306
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,480
going to be paid back

307
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,680
so next we're going to talk about what

308
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
the victim could have done to protect

309
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,279
themselves before engaging with the

310
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,680
actor

311
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,959
so put your dating cap on for a minute

312
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,079
oops i think i went too far

313
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,160
oh i lost my way

314
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
okay sorry about that

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,240
so put your dating cap on for a minute

316
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,680
and ask yourself what could i have done

317
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,640
to protect myself in this situation

318
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,560
if the victim's social media accounts

319
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
had stricter privacy settings the actor

320
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,079
would have had a more difficult time

321
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,800
finding them on social media the victim

322
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,640
could have been more cautious about who

323
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,600
they

324
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
chose to connect to and could have done

325
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
some research

326
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,839
before engaging in conversation

327
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
now once they were connected the victim

328
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
could have continued with that guarded

329
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,480
mindset and done continued to do

330
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,240
research as new information from the

331
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,560
actor came in there were several warning

332
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,399
signs that at first the victim seemed to

333
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,360
ignore

334
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,480
this was

335
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,880
the perfect match the perfect person in

336
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,959
every way shape or form and usually if

337
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,720
it seems too good to be true it probably

338
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,680
is

339
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,160
they were unable to have phone or video

340
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
conversations now these were all

341
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,040
explained away

342
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
but

343
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,480
it was still suspicious

344
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,440
and it was it was overlooked

345
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,920
but the biggest red flag of all was how

346
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,360
quickly that this

347
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,079
romance progressed and also the

348
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,320
financial requests coming in

349
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,399
the victim could have taken some of the

350
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,639
images that were provided by the actor

351
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,040
and done a quick google image search and

352
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,399
would have found that the images that

353
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,839
were being provided were that of a

354
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,360
public figure

355
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
now the victim did do this eventually

356
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,959
however it was after the

357
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,959
financial loss had already been incurred

358
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,680
so next we're going to discuss the

359
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,760
impact romance fraud can have on your

360
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,240
company's brand and reputation

361
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,000
why would the actor claim to work for a

362
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,920
particular company why do we care and

363
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,959
what can we do about it

364
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,839
so we see quite a bit of romance fraud

365
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,680
reported and it's all by individuals who

366
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
are inquiring about their friend does

367
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,680
their friend work for our company and

368
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,760
the first question i hear is why would

369
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,040
somebody pretend to work for your

370
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,000
company

371
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,079
well bechdel's a reputable construction

372
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,680
and engineering company with projects

373
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
all over the world so this makes it easy

374
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,839
for the actor for a couple of reasons

375
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,680
first it explains why they can't meet in

376
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,959
person

377
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,040
it explains why they might be working on

378
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,200
a remote project with spotty wi-fi so

379
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,279
they can't have face time conversations

380
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,720
they don't have cell service so they

381
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,880
can't have phone conversations

382
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,240
and the second thing that it does is it

383
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,079
provides the actor with a sense of

384
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,000
stability and security with a good

385
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
career

386
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,279
and this is enticing to the victim the

387
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,040
victim as i said before was an

388
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,519
emotionally vulnerable person who was

389
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,639
looking for love it's emotion over logic

390
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,120
so they're always going to be very

391
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,639
enticed enticing

392
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,279
so sometimes the actor would even

393
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,440
provide falsified documents on company

394
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,519
letterhead

395
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,199
um

396
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,959
counterfeit badges to prove that they

397
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,040
were that they worked for our company

398
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,880
sometimes their social media profiles

399
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,320
would indicate that they work for our

400
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,079
company or they might even provide an

401
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,519
email address that's

402
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,680
impersonation email address

403
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,519
so what can be done

404
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,600
once we verify that it is in fact fraud

405
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,279
and this person was not an employee of

406
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,199
our company nor have they ever been we

407
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,639
instruct the

408
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,800
victim to cease communications with them

409
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
immediately

410
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,399
we tell them to report it to their local

411
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,760
law enforcement if they feel that

412
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
they've been a victim of a crime and

413
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,360
then we encourage them to file an

414
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,560
internet crimes report with the fbi

415
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,720
and if they are unsure of how to do that

416
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
we would in some instances we would

417
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
assist them with that

418
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,959
then we gather as much information as we

419
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,279
can to build our brand abuse case we

420
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,680
document all of our findings we conduct

421
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,000
research we read through any

422
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
conversations that are provided to us by

423
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,839
the victim we're always looking for a

424
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,240
connection to our company

425
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,560
we search at the after social media

426
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
profiles we do google reverse image

427
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,279
searches on the images that are provided

428
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,360
and look for any actionable items and if

429
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,760
there is actionable items we work with a

430
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,440
third-party company to disable the

431
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,800
adversary infrastructure

432
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,399
so we're nearing the end here and i

433
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,160
wanted to cover just a couple of other

434
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,800
things the proactive measures that can

435
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
be taken to protect your brand and why

436
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,440
that's important

437
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,120
impersonation of your brand can affect

438
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,720
so many areas of your business from

439
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,959
business development to your industry

440
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,720
reputation which can affect winning

441
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
contracts or bids really can affect your

442
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,040
revenue and that's why it's imperative

443
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,680
to protect your brand at all costs so

444
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,120
these are a couple of things that can be

445
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,199
done to help with this effort

446
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,360
create a group for this purpose

447
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
identify a group of key players within

448
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
your organization who can meet regularly

449
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
to discuss fraudulent practices that are

450
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,639
affecting your brand

451
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,480
it's a really good idea to ensure that

452
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
this group is made up of members that

453
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,639
have varying backgrounds this way each

454
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,360
person can contribute by providing

455
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,959
guidance and input in their area of

456
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,560
expertise

457
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,399
additionally if at all possible

458
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,399
it's a good idea to allocate budget to

459
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,240
outsource the monitoring and disabling

460
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,560
of fraudulent infrastructure to a brand

461
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,000
protection company

462
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
brand protection companies can work to

463
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,800
disable fake email addresses remove your

464
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,560
company's information from social media

465
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
profiles sometimes they can even

466
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,720
completely have social media profiles

467
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,079
disabled

468
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,759
but brand protection companies do come

469
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,759
in many different shapes and sizes so

470
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,680
you absolutely want to do your due

471
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,120
diligence to ensure that you're picking

472
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,199
the correct company that fits your needs

473
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,279
so the last thing that i wanted to cover

474
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,759
was a couple of high profile arrests

475
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,000
that were made in 2021 now as we saw in

476
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,519
the beginning of the presentation the

477
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,959
slide with the

478
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,000
stats

479
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920
this is an increasing problem it's

480
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,360
gained the attention of hollywood with

481
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,120
the documentaries and it's also gained

482
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,279
the attention of law enforcement

483
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,199
the first case i'd like to highlight was

484
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,759
from september of 2021

485
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,240
33 individuals were arrested across

486
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,720
texas they were part of black acts which

487
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
is a transitional organized crime

488
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,240
syndicate originating in nigeria but

489
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
they operate worldwide

490
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,240
authorities stated they engaged in a

491
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,400
wide range of fraudulent schemes such as

492
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,799
business email compromise investor scams

493
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,599
and unemployment insurance fraud and

494
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
online romance scams

495
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,679
there was 17 million dollars in

496
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,839
financial loss and over 100

497
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,199
victims the second one i'd like to

498
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,119
highlight happened a month later in

499
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,240
october of 2021 eight nigerian men were

500
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,480
arrested in a decade-long scam that

501
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,919
swindled seven million dollars from

502
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,200
their victims

503
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
this was also linked to the arrest made

504
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,080
in september of 2021 and the black acts

505
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,320
organized crime syndicate

506
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,160
so as we can see this is a growing

507
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,520
problem

508
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,200
but it is getting the attention of law

509
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
enforcement and there is action being

510
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,280
taken

511
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,000
so as i'm closing out here this slide

512
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,679
i've provided links to some of the

513
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,440
resources that i mentioned throughout

514
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,960
the presentation

515
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,039
that's all i have for you today i hope

516
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,360
you have found this to be informative

517
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,440
interesting and enjoyable

518
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,400
are there any questions

519
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
there are indeed

520
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,159
um

521
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,760
uh

522
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,160
right so actually i had a question for

523
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,840
you

524
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,960
um and

525
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,080
i'll get a sec i should just load yes

526
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,400
um so

527
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,919
the

528
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,720
engaging in one of these scams does

529
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,200
require you to know

530
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,520
how someone from a certain country would

531
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,480
speak

532
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
for example or the country you would be

533
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
impersonating from

534
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,000
and

535
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
is it more frequent for these actors to

536
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,679
be in the same region as their

537
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,440
you victims in the cases that i can only

538
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,960
speak obviously to the cases that i've

539
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,919
worked um they generally

540
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,200
claim to be in the same region

541
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,480
but i would say from victim to

542
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,799
actor no

543
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,039
okay

544
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,919
awesome i also i had a question myself

545
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,200
um

546
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,160
so on instagram there's often a lot of

547
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
sugar daddy and sugar baby scams

548
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,360
is this considered romance fraud as well

549
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,320
well i guess it would depend on how that

550
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,559
went down i mean i i think that it could

551
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,960
be considered romance if there's a theft

552
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,720
of

553
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,600
personal information or a theft of money

554
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
of some sort without any

555
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,080
i mean if you have a sugar daddy sending

556
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
gifts over that could be a whole

557
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,039
different situation

558
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,360
but you know i think that it it comes

559
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,880
that down to uh is there lies being told

560
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,120
in order to gain the finances or

561
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,639
personal information of the victim

562
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,200
awesome thank you yeah that makes sense

563
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
nicos any other questions

564
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,480
uh i don't have any and i've not seen

565
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,559
one in chat

566
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,600
so

567
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,039
that

568
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,280
that's pretty much it i think

569
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,679
uh yes there is another question it

570
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,960
looks like

571
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,360
um it says does internal teams work with

572
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,960
brand protection organizations or does

573
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,559

574
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,480
the work

575
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,760
