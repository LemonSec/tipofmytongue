my name is ahmed and i'm going to be

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,480
talking about offensive security welcome

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,080
to the dark side

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,720
so who is this specimen who is this

search party in my free time

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,640
my team came 20th place just saying just

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,120
saying uh i'm passionate about

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,440
everything cyber security and uh i got

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
my ejpt which was my first certification

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,039
um at 17 years old so that's about about

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,440
me i do like to um

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,520
create content on youtube i have a

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,440
youtube channel uh that i'll link at the

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,280
very end of the slide and

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
throughout uh

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
as we get on with the as we go on with

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,520
the talk i'll have time for questions if

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,360
anyone has any questions for me

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,720
um so let's get started so i want you to

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
picture this with me okay i want you to

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,520
to to really imagine this with me you

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,200
have a castle and it's filled with

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,680
riches and gold and so much wealth

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,520
you have a lot of security measures uh

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,159
to prevent any kind of theft

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,960
but one day you you wake up and you find

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,880
that this person stole from you and your

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
riches and your gold

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,520
now

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,000
similarly but in a more digital form

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,720
think of your organization as the castle

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,040
and think of your riches

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,280
as the company's data or profit your

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,040
security measures is your password your

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,360
antivirus firewall intrusion detection

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,040
system and maybe also have intrusion

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
prevention systems

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,040
now

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
is the thing you have all of that in

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,159
place

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,479
but you still fall victim to a cyber

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,560
attack and

57
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
what happens now so you had your

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
security measures in place the cars were

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,280
awake and didn't see anyone conducting

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
the highest the cameras did not pick up

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
anything the question is what do you do

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
now where do you go from here

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,959
so

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,560
here is where i want to present

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
offensive security

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,920
offensive security is an approach to

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,239
better secure your systems networks and

68
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,040
assets by hiring what we call a white

69
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,520
hat hacker to try and break into your

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,319
systems as if they were an adversary

71
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,599
so

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
we as the good guys as the white hat

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,560
hacker it's

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,160
pretty much us

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,640
pretending and kind of simulating a

76
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,760
break-in

77
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,040
to uh

78
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,280
kind of see where your where where your

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,160
flaws are at what assets or where you

80
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,840
might have an issue

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
and then from there we go back and we

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
reported the security team and then uh

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
give feedback on how we were able to do

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,959
this and this is what we call a

85
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,680
penetration test so this is a simulated

86
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,959
cyber attack

87
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,840
attempt to expose and test any potential

88
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
security flaws

89
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,440
of an organization company etc now i

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,560
know i know what you're thinking before

91
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,599
you judge me i know what you're thinking

92
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,800
i know you're probably saying how is

93
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,840
this legal let me explain let me explain

94
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,680
there are kind of three characteristics

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,000
that i would say uh define the fine line

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
between ethical and unethical

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,280
you have intentions which is our

98
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
intentions to improve a company's

99
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,120
security or are your intentions to steal

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,360
or harm a company then you have your

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,480
scope when you're conducting a

102
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,159
penetration test engagement you have a

103
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,840
scope where you're allowed to kind of

104
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
play around and test and

105
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
and work your magic on that kind of area

106
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,080
but

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,319
if you go out of that scope that would

108
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,760
be unethical

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,360
if you stick to that scope if you stick

110
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
to that defined area of attack where

111
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
you're allowed

112
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
to go and play

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,799
and this is given by the company so the

114
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,159
scope would be given to you by the

115
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,000
company the company will tell you i

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
alright this is my scope i want you to

117
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,720
just test these um assets

118
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
that would be uh so just sticking to

119
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,680
that kind of scope would be ethical

120
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,760
and then lastly you have permissions so

121
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,239
do you have valid permission do you have

122
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,680
valid um consent from that company to

123
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,000
conduct this attempt a simulated cyber

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
attack do you have uh permission or are

125
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
you doing this simply with no permission

126
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,680
no one knows about it you're just doing

127
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,759
this on your own so that's kind of the

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,839
three characteristics that define the

129
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
line between

130
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,479
ethical and not unethical

131
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,600
and we really want to stay on that side

132
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,560
so

133
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,720
let's break it down um

134
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,440
when i think of a penetration test um i

135
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
try i narrow it down so some might say

136
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,600
there's more but i narrowed it down to

137
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
four stages you have reconnaissance

138
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,560
scanning gaining access and reporting

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
now with reconnaissance that's the first

140
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,639
stage of a penetration test is you're

141
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,000
gathering information you're going

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,199
around and you're trying to see what

143
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,479
information you can gather kind of

144
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,400
trying to paint a picture of the company

145
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,160
that you're trying to break into so see

146
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
what you can learn see who's the

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
who's the uh ceo who's the head of

148
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,560
security

149
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,759
where the

150
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,360
what the company's goals are what the

151
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
company's uh

152
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
you know what the company is based on is

153
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
it is it an it firm is it a financial

154
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,800
firm

155
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,280
kind of get a picture just get an idea

156
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,080
of what you can learn from this company

157
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,560
uh that's available to you

158
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
and then from there you go into scanning

159
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,919
and you start looking for potential

160
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,160
areas of attack so here you would start

161
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,600
looking see uh maybe there's um

162
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,919
a vulnerable web uh website that you

163
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,400
could maybe take advantage of or there's

164
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,960
an open port that maybe was left open uh

165
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,039
accidentally so you could abuse and and

166
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,400
use that

167
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,759
from there once you've kind of figured

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,000
out okay this is kind of the path i want

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
to take this is kind of the area that i

170
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
want to start um

171
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
attacking from you go into the third

172
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,440
stage and this is the main stage where

173
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
you actually gain access

174
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,360
um you start you break you conduct that

175
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,759
break-in and you try to gain access to

176
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,440
that uh

177
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
to that system from there once you're

178
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
successful you'll go into reporting

179
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,440
you'll write a report back to the

180
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,080
security team and

181
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
uh back to explain okay so this is how i

182
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,639
conducted it i was able to learn that

183
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,120
you had maybe an open port that was uh

184
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,240
left unchecked and i was able to get uh

185
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,919
access and from there you kind of just

186
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,919
write how you were able to

187
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,600
kind of like a summary of how you were

188
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,479
able to conduct that temptation test

189
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,520
and comment oh no who who sabotaged my

190
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,759
who know uh who sabotaged my my

191
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
presentation no okay we're gonna ignore

192
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,880
that

193
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,759
uh

194
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,280
no okay so

195
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,199
common tools that penetration testers

196
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,360
use to kind of assist them uh during a

197
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,600
pen testing engagement you have record

198
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
for reconnaissance you'll have google

199
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,560
and social media so you'll go under

200
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,479
social media see where you can learn uh

201
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,840
um

202
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,639
see

203
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,400
what you can find out about the company

204
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,280
google is a very uh great tool as well

205
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,680
and uh it's part of it as well

206
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,319
so once you kind of use google use

207
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,800
social media see or maybe the the

208
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,199
security team goes out to drink uh for

209
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,319
drinks

210
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,759
somewhere or

211
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,520
they're

212
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,720
uh or or you know they go and

213
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,680
play uh maybe hang out somewhere or they

214
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,720
go on the weekends to for a run together

215
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
whatever it is

216
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,680
you kind of just learn about the company

217
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,280
you learn about everyone in the company

218
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,479
you learn about the employees and you

219
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,240
just build an image a greater image um

220
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,520
and these are some of the tools that can

221
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,960
really help you do that

222
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
from there you would have scanning which

223
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,599
is the second stage and of a penetration

224
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,599
test and then you have nmap which is a

225
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,960
network port scanner and they can help

226
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
you identify open ports so this can

227
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,080
really help you find if there's a

228
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
potentially uh open port that's been

229
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,080
left unchecked that you could maybe uh

230
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,879
use their buster is

231
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,160
a tool that can

232
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
reforce web directories and this is a

233
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
vulnerability scanner so a bunch of

234
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
tools that can really help you um in

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,400
your engagement

236
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,840
from there once you've kind of figured

237
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,599
out okay so there's a vulnerability here

238
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,680
or there's an open port there that you

239
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,160
want to kind of uh start

240
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,919
conducting your attack on you actually

241
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,680
go and gain access and some of my

242
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
favorite tools are metzploid netcat and

243
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,440
hydra so metsploit being um

244
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,599
a framework which can spin up

245
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,759
it has so much it's so it's so fast and

246
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,000
big but there's so much functionality

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,199
you have

248
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,319
metsploit uh which can uh

249
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,799
it what it does is it's a framework that

250
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,320
can you can spin up exploits you can

251
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,200
have backdoors you can uh listeners and

252
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,479
there's scanners in it if you want to

253
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,279
scan for uh open ports just like just

254
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,760
like nmap it has so much functionality

255
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
and uh it's quite it's honestly stable

256
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
it's one of my favorite tools um and

257
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,519
then you have netcat which is a network

258
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,760
utility um

259
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,399
and they can help you set up listeners

260
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
in your engagement then you also have

261
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
hydra which is a direct which is a brute

262
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,640
forcer in general and it can brute force

263
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,399
many protocols ssh

264
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,000
it can ssh ftp a bunch a bunch of uh

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
protocols and then lastly you have

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
report the final stage which is

267
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,360
reporting and these are some

268
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,839
dradis magic tree and metagoofil are

269
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,560
some of the three um

270
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,800
tools that come pre-installed with an

271
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080
operating system uh called uh kali linux

272
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,920
which is basically a distribution that

273
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,760
has pre-installed tools for you so

274
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,240
you're just there and

275
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,600
it's it

276
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,880
you have all these tools set up for you

277
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
including and map under buster analysis

278
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,040
and exploit netcat and hydra all of

279
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,480
these tools are just pre-installed for

280
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
you

281
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
ready for you to use so that

282
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,640
being one of my favorite tools

283
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,640
getting access in the end is no use if

284
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,440
you cannot write a good report

285
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,120
the whole point of you conducting that

286
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
pen test is that once you gain access

287
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,200
you write that report back so that the

288
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
security team can identify the issue and

289
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,519
can fix it the whole point is that

290
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,040
you're improving you're trying to

291
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,560
improve security and you have to

292
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
understand that

293
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,519
sometimes

294
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,800
this report won't just go to the

295
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,120
security team it'll also it might go to

296
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
the board or

297
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,920
heck it might even go to the ceo but so

298
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,040
when you write your report you have to

299
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,800
make sure that you're writing one that's

300
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,079
both

301
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,600
that both the technical side and the

302
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,680
non-technical side can understand it has

303
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,760
to be well written in the way where both

304
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
sides can understand not just one side

305
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,160
has to be fully technical to understand

306
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
um and and fix the the issues when you

307
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,720
that you've mentioned in your report

308
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,360
now speaking of distributions uh there

309
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,200
are two common penetration testing this

310
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
uh operating system there's a bunch more

311
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
but these i would say are the two most

312
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,640
common ones there's kali linux and

313
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,680
parrot os both open source both great uh

314
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,000
i've tried both personally i just just

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,399
saying i'm just saying i prefer cali

316
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,760
linux i'm that that's the team i'm on um

317
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,360
but that's just personal preference of

318
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
course um

319
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,399
and yeah they both have many many tools

320
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,200
installed that you can uh use during to

321
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
start your engagement uh

322
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,680
so your penetration test engagement um

323
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
so you don't have to

324
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,279
go through the hassle of reinstalling

325
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,360
all of those tools uh and map their

326
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,399
buster

327
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,079
all of those tools come pre-installed

328
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,079
with that distribution you just have to

329
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,760
spin it up in a virtual machine and

330
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,560
you're ready to go

331
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,399
now another thing i want to talk about

332
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,600
is

333
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,200
the tools that i mentioned they're all

334
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
open source so they're all available to

335
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
the public and you can approve them

336
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,800
and uh

337
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
but sometimes

338
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,399
if you're in an engagement and

339
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,880
you're in an environment where you don't

340
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,240
have access to nmap or metsploit or you

341
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
don't have access to these pre-built uh

342
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,720
pre-installed or pre-built tools

343
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
sometimes it's a good idea to create

344
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,040
your own

345
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,079
uh some to further you know move to

346
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,040
further

347
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,000
and

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,839
to further go along with your engagement

349
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,040
so

350
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
uh a great uh

351
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,360
scripting language would be python uh

352
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,839
which is the two is the blue one is the

353
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,480
blue yellow snake uh right

354
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,360
facing uh offsets each other so that's

355
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,000
python and you can create your own diy

356
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,680
and map with it you can create your own

357
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
um port scanner with it

358
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,560
there's also go and bash bash being one

359
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,040
that that's really useful for automation

360
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,959
so if you want to automate the task bash

361
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,920
is really useful for that

362
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,440
some there are really really there are a

363
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,880
lot of different assets when it comes to

364
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,600
penetration testing and

365
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,639
i know it's

366
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,440
i know it's a lot but just bear with me

367
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,600
pen testing engagements can be conducted

368
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,519
on different assets including web apps

369
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,760
networks iot devices which are internet

370
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,800
of things

371
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,440
and android and ios mobile applications

372
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
and physical buildings so you can

373
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,680
conduct a physical penetration test on

374
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
the building steve

375
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,600
if you can social engineer engineer your

376
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
way into a building into a restricted

377
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
area and

378
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,160
sometimes it's really useful to conduct

379
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,360
not just conduct

380
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,320
you know technical

381
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
technical uh penetration tests but it's

382
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,360
also good to conduct physical ones as

383
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
well

384
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
now

385
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,880
when i have to say uh training providers

386
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,959
there are

387
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,560
these two uh

388
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
these are the two most common trained

389
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,920
providers i have to say that give you

390
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,880
consent and you can

391
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
train yourself and and practice your

392
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,800
skills in penetration testing uh for

393
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,320
free and

394
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,800
you have consent to play around uh and

395
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,360
and practice your skills with

396
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
so one of them being a very famous one

397
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,199
is hack the box and this is a

398
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,440
this is a platform that is

399
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,360
a ctf based and they also have an

400
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,199
academy where they'll teach you

401
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,880
different uh

402
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,440
different fantastic uh skills so you

403
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,680
could uh they'll teach you the basics of

404
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,279
web they'll they'll even teach you how

405
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,800
to uh exploit a bunch of things um so

406
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,399
you can go there and you can start

407
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,399
learning if you're interested you can go

408
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,839
and start learning how

409
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,440
this world works and

410
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,399
dive deeper into the subject matter and

411
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,199
try hack me has what they call rooms and

412
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,120
you have two kinds of rooms i have to

413
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,920
say is one of them are

414
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,680
educational ones so they're made to

415
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,519
teach you uh concepts so they'll teach

416
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,480
you uh concepts on how the web works or

417
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
how um assertion tool works

418
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,399
and they'll have another room which is a

419
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,639
more ctf capture the flag uh what we

420
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,480
call a capture the flag and this is

421
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
where you'll it's more of a challenge

422
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,600
and

423
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000
you you're conducting like a simulated

424
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,399
test in a gamified version to try and

425
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,720
reach that like final piece of flag at

426
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,480
the end and once you get that flag

427
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,880
that's that's kind of how the game ends

428
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,519
once you find that flag

429
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,320
so it's a very fun way to gamify cyber

430
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,880
security and penetration testing to

431
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,160
actually

432
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,519
you know you're not just learning but

433
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,480
you're also

434
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,760
playing around in a fun way to which

435
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,880
both teaches you and um

436
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,639
and you're having fun during the process

437
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,800
so you're not just learning um you know

438
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,720
theory having to write down everything

439
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
pen and paper style no but you're also

440
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
doing it hands-on you're on the keyboard

441
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,839
and you're learning and you're having

442
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,079
fun

443
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,760
so now let's solve a business

444
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,360
you spent years

445
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,120
years creating what you think is the

446
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,800
most secure unbreakable system for your

447
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
organization so you have everything in

448
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,880
play you have you think you've done the

449
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
best possible job

450
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,519
but you still wake up the next day and

451
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,279
you're still fall victim to a cyber

452
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,199
attack and it can be really discouraging

453
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,680
and really um really rough

454
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,199
now why is that

455
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,639
so you see

456
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,680
it's really not a question of

457
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,199
if i will be attacked it's a matter of

458
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,519
when will i be attacked so once you have

459
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,440
that kind of concept in mind

460
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,519
no company is ever

461
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,000
100 prone to uh

462
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
cyber attacks there's always going to be

463
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,480
some way where you would fall victim to

464
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,000
a cyber attack

465
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,880
so it's

466
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,079
it's almost like it's inevitable

467
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,839
sometimes all an attacker really needs

468
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,839
to do is send one fake email just one

469
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,360
email imagine

470
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,079
you like dogs or cats

471
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,839
and you there's an email that says you

472
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,639
can get your cat back uh

473
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,000
a voucher one to for example have

474
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,600
your cat

475
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,959
checked up on

476
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,240
for free

477
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,519
and you just have to click this link to

478
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
sign up

479
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,600
all it takes is that one click to steal

480
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,920
your uh still credentials of the

481
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,079
organization if you're accessing it from

482
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,800
an organization

483
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,720
computer to steal credentials to the

484
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,199
organization or for an admit to just

485
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,240
forget

486
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,360
a sim

487
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
and we're all humans we all forget so

488
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,440
sometimes politics is just one person to

489
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,079
forget to change the default password

490
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
and then that's an open door for an

491
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
attacker to abuse that and harm the

492
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
company

493
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,359
so the best way to kind of go about

494
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,880
dealing with this issue is to conduct a

495
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
penetration test every 12 months doing

496
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
that will help you see that maybe what

497
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
you thought you when if you thought you

498
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,959
changed the default admin password you

499
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,199
really didn't or maybe

500
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,880
something you didn't know existed an

501
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,720
issue or a vulnerability that existed

502
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,640
that you didn't know about you would

503
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,400
find out because

504
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,039
you've had someone try to break in and

505
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,200
try to see where kind of

506
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,640
where are the holes in the castle that

507
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,960
you can kind of go in and and

508
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,160
and try and

509
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,039
steal

510
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,280
those riches and those um

511
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,960
and that data and that profit

512
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,799
anyone can fall victim to a fishing uh

513
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,480
to a phishing link anyone can public

514
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,799
them to a social engineering attack

515
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,640
we're all humans and

516
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,480
needless to say i've probably

517
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,160
fallen for one uh

518
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,520
one for many actually um

519
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,039
but

520
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,880
it's important that the company that

521
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,039
you're working on that you're working in

522
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,919
also teaches you how uh security

523
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,919
awareness training so security awareness

524
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,600
training every once every um

525
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,000
every year just once every year you have

526
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,360
security awareness training to remind

527
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
those employees of how to spot a

528
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,720
phishing link or how to uh you know

529
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,919
read and and verify this this is the

530
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,480
the the right uh sender who's sending

531
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,160
you this and it's not some

532
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,360
uh

533
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,600
you know someone who's with malicious

534
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,039
intent trying to harm the company

535
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,520
and

536
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,679
on that note i want to move on to some

537
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,120
recent cyber crimes that have happened

538
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
last month and i want to just bring this

539
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,000
to light

540
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,600
of the cyber attacks that have happened

541
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,080
uh in march so the the two uh the two

542
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,520
separate crimes i'm going to be talking

543
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,240
about today have happened in march 2022

544
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,000
so the first one being morgan stanley

545
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,760
which is an american multinational

546
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,400
investment bank and financial services

547
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,919
company

548
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,160
got uh many of its client accounts

549
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,919
breached in a social engineering attack

550
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,480
and this happened through a wishing to a

551
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,840
wishing attack and this is when the

552
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,039
kind of

553
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,280
the threat actor or the

554
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,400
the the malicious user will will go on a

555
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,919
phone call

556
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,120
and they'll start

557
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,480
pretending

558
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,760
that there's

559
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
there's someone of legit who they say

560
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,400
they are and try to extract information

561
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
through the phone

562
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
and uh you know luckily the company was

563
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
able to deactivate those accounts and no

564
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
harm was done besides the

565
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
you know the credentials and the being

566
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,840
leaked to the

567
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,600
public but besides that

568
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,120
any you can see that this is a really

569
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,039
big company and

570
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,120
it still fell victim to a cyber attack

571
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,199
through a social engineering attack now

572
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
a massive cyber security budget this

573
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,880
just goes to show that a massive

574
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
security budget won't stop you from

575
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,520
being hacked it it really just because

576
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
you have such a

577
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
a large amount of money and you invest

578
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,400
so much money and time into um

579
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,720
into taking care of that technical side

580
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,159
that you forget there's also a human

581
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,200
side when there's a technical side

582
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,960
the human side is just as important to

583
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,159
secure as the technical side

584
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,000
and another one which really shocked me

585
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
if i have to say this took me by

586
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
surprise

587
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,400
uh lapses which is what a really big

588
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,240
cyber crime organization

589
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,320
um and just

590
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,840
for some context here they're

591
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,480
responsible for breaching octa microsoft

592
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,280
nvidia and samsung so all really big

593
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,480
companies

594
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,080
and

595
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,400
just in march they found out that a 16

596
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,039
year old from oxford was the was accused

597
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,720
of being one of the leaders of the

598
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,360
organization so you can see that

599
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,200
a cyber criminal can be any young um

600
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,640
teenager

601
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,720
to a more experienced adult there's no

602
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,480
age limit to

603
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,320
that says oh you have to be at least 18

604
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,400
years old to attack a company that

605
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
doesn't exist so

606
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,039
make sure that you know you have your uh

607
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,919
good security measures in place and

608
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,480
this can be more

609
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,600
and

610
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,039
a way to prevent this would be doing a

611
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,559
penetration test if

612
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,559
if you constantly do penetration tests

613
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,799
at least once every year you're more

614
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,360
likely to see those vulnerabilities that

615
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,679
popped up that the hackers were able or

616
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,559
the

617
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,280
attackers were able to use

618
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,679
and the views

619
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,320
now this this brings me to my next point

620
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,159
which is benefits of a fantast when you

621
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,000
are conducting a pen test you can really

622
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,280
reveal where the problem is in your

623
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,000
systems um a pen test should not be

624
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,440
conducted just once it should be

625
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,000
conducted at least every 12 months and

626
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,760
if for whatever reason one of your

627
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,559
employees needs more um

628
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,600
uh

629
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,480
is not really aware of

630
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,559
is security aware

631
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,720
providing providing security awareness

632
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,559
training again one at least once every

633
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,679
uh

634
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,000
once every uh year is really important

635
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,799
to prevent that to prevent not just the

636
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,960
technical side but also the the human

637
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,280
side of security and in the end you're

638
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,960
you're really not just hardening systems

639
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,480
but you're also hardening personalities

640
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
too

641
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
and before i

642
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,440
kind of uh go up and leave here i want

643
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,080
to leave everyone with a quote and

644
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,880
that is you can't learn how to defend

645
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,679
against an attacker if you don't know

646
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,360
how the attacker is conducting the

647
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
attack

648
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
with that being said some of the key

649
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
takeaways that i want everyone to go

650
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,600
home uh with today is being offensive

651
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,000
can be used in a good way and to reveal

652
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,320
accompanying security flaws anyone can

653
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,520
learn the documents of offensive

654
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
security so

655
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,159
i'm

656
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,760
18 years old if i could learn anyone can

657
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,280
comment training providers that you can

658
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,640
sign up right now and practice

659
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,440
penetration testing legally are try hack

660
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,280
me and hack the box and you can build

661
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,679
your own scripts and tools using uh

662
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,919
scripting languages such as python go or

663
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,039
bash

664
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,200
and the biggest advice the the best

665
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,120
advice i could possibly give anyone

666
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,080
who's really interested or

667
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,159
fascinated by this is never limit

668
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,600
yourself and

669
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,880
this isn't just insecurity but in

670
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,360
general never limit yourself to

671
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,000
sticking to one methodology or one

672
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,120
approach or one technology to learn

673
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,480
explore

674
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,080
different engagements will require

675
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,000
different

676
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,240
uh approaches and sometimes you can't

677
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,880
stick to the same methodology all the

678
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
time so

679
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,400
think outside the box and

680
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
don't be afraid to

681
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,039
you know leave what you're used to and

682
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,320
that maybe that

683
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,600
four-stage

684
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,279
penetration test if you have your own

685
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,200
methodology don't be afraid to try out a

686
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,640
new methodology maybe that will work

687
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,240
better in your penetration testing

688
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,640
engagement

689
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,720
and if you would like to reach me i'm

690
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,279
that there's my email it's

691
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:15,120
ahmad.rushfound outlook.com uh my

692
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,000
instagram is at rsasec0x01

693
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,480
which is just rsa being

694
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,520
rushed once

695
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,360
my name backwards with security

696
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,520
concatenated to it um that's also my

697
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,640
twitter handle ahmed r60x01 and my

698
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,840
youtube is ahmadrishwan

699
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,200
um i hope you learned something i hope

700
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,799
this was interesting

701
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,120
and i hope you're a little fascinated by

702
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,039
this and i have time for questions if

703
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,880
anyone uh wants to ask questions i'm

704
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,440
ready to answer them

705
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,520
oh boy i have a few questions uh

706
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,400
actually

707
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
um i'm ready

708
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,279
okay

709
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,400
so uh first question um so you recommend

710
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,320
um

711
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,720
so you have

712
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,559
okay no someone else i'm gonna start

713
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,840
with someone else's question because

714
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,000
otherwise uh i'm gonna get lost okay uh

715
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,080
what do you recommend uh doing to

716
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
practice making scripts uh was there a

717
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
site that helped you a lot in learning

718
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,640
to create scripts

719
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,440
so

720
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,360
i would say if you really understand the

721
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,880
basic um

722
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,559
the really basic fundamentals of a

723
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,080
programming language so you know like

724
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,720
what a variable is or uh what a loop is

725
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
how to use a loop

726
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
that can really help you kind of so you

727
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,960
know for example if you're trying to

728
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,600
create a script brute force or something

729
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,480
you

730
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,320
you as you try and

731
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,760
think if you understand the core

732
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,960
concepts really well you'll understand

733
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,880
that okay maybe this is a loop that i

734
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,400
can do and it can

735
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,039
you could maybe use bash to read a list

736
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,520
of um let's say directories and you can

737
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,440
use the while loop to kind of

738
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,640
test that

739
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,320
those different directories by sending

740
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,960
web requests or whatever it

741
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,279
really to to just help the best way is

742
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,279
just to try and

743
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,640
get a lot and a lot and a lot of errors

744
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,880
in the process but it's just to keep

745
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,919
trying and having that um

746
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:04,799
uh

747
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,640
trial and error process

748
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,159
uh

749
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,039
when you're creating your scripts

750
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,240
awesome

751
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,279
um so now on to my questions uh so you

752
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,120
mentioned doing a pen test every 12

753
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,400
months uh there's a few questions uh on

754
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,279
that end mainly uh how do you deal with

755
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,720
people that

756
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,559
do pen tests in a

757
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,039
uh checklist manner so if you were more

758
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,080
on a company side uh you know checklist

759
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,000
pen testers people that go through a

760
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,080
baseline set of tests and go then go

761
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
drop a report and poop that's it how

762
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,799
would you deal with them

763
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,960
okay

764
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,120
so

765
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,120
not i'm not going to say it's

766
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,400
necessarily

767
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,559
a bad approach

768
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,960
but

769
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
going through a checklist

770
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,200
may leave out what's in the middle

771
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,760
so if you if you're going by so if

772
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
you're going all right one i want to

773
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,240
check first the networks and then i want

774
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,320
to check maybe um

775
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,000
if any of the machines are vulnerable if

776
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,760
they if they're all if they all have

777
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,919
antiviruses you could miss out what's in

778
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
the middle between point one and point

779
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,600
two and that's why

780
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,919
it's not necessarily a bad idea it's not

781
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,559
a and it could work

782
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,600
but it's better to not stick to kind of

783
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,600
an organized um checklist manner

784
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,039
when you're uh connecting a penetration

785
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,640
test because the whole point is that

786
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,799
you're trying to see what's in between

787
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,039
those in between those two points so if

788
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,200
you have a checklist and between point

789
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,480
one and point two

790
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,159
the whole point of a penetration that's

791
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,399
this you're not trying to check if

792
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,240
they're secure you're trying to check

793
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
what's not secure and to do that you'd

794
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,960
have to read in between those points

795
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,039
no so yeah i would say is it's not

796
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,039
necessarily an idea but it it's better

797
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,919
to

798
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,440
read what's in between those points

799
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,399
okay

800
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,159
and uh i guess i'll continue with um

801
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,080
like 12 months uh

802
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,360
questions um so imagine yeah

803
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,840
it spawned a few questions um

804
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,320
if you add infrastructure let's say uh

805
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,640
you're spinning up some new uh

806
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,399
kubernetes clusters on your internal

807
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,799
infrastructure uh would you recommend

808
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,320
moving the date of your pen test to like

809
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,760
right after you've spun up all this

810
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,880
to check that there's no gaps in your uh

811
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,480
infrastructure security okay

812
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,919
uh i'm gonna need you to repeat your

813
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,679
question just one more time okay if

814
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,880
that's okay so

815
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,840
if you uh use um kubernetes or whatever

816
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,240
to spawn up some infrastructure

817
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,559
would you recommend moving the pen test

818
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,159
time like when you're doing the pen test

819
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
to right after you've done this

820
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,840
i would recommend doing it when you

821
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,159
think it's ready to go out to the public

822
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,120
and

823
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,039
it's ready to uh be shown to the public

824
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,799
i would recommend doing it right before

825
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,120
that because then you know that this is

826
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,039
what would be going out to the public

827
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,840
and you would see okay so maybe there's

828
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
certain infrastructure that's vulnerable

829
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
in a way that you didn't take into

830
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,240
account so i would suggest right before

831
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,159
you maybe push out to the uh if you're

832
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,240
on an infrastructure and

833
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,399
you know maybe that you have a web

834
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,840
server running

835
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,360
make sure that

836
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,200
just right before you're pushing it out

837
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,840
you have

838
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,360
um and conduct a penetration test at

839
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,919
least at that time uh to check that both

840
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,520
the infrastructure and the assets are

841
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,200
going out to the public are both secure

842
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:36,960
okay

843
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,919
and uh the final one uh that i had and

844
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,000
then i'll let eden take

845
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,120
the others

846
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,640
um

847
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,720
so imagine once again from the

848
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,120
perspective of a company you um

849
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,440
contract a pen testing company or a pen

850
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,360
tester uh to do

851
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,440
okay you know a test

852
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,200
would you be recommending switching

853
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,679
between these uh different uh

854
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,720
i don't know entities

855
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,760
to see if there were so you're saying is

856
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,480
so you're saying

857
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,559
you know uh

858
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,520
going with

859
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,919
a company that's that's uh

860
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,159
that's assigning the hand that's uh

861
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,919
assigning the pen tester as opposed to

862
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,799
just a single pen and tester uh

863
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,399
is that am i getting your question right

864
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,840
is that kind of what you what you're

865
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,000
talking about not exactly so um for

866
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,440
example if you're a company and you

867
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,919
contract a pen tester or a pen testing

868
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,080
company so to do a pen test on your

869
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,440
infrastructure

870
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,559
okay um

871
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,240
would you recommend switching between

872
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,399
who does the pen test so to see if the

873
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,559
results change

874
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,799
i would recommend so

875
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,840
uh

876
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,679
you know typically the penetration test

877
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,600
would it's it's good to have more than

878
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,720
one pair of eye when you're doing

879
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,880
fantastic because um one pair of eyes

880
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,360
won't you know necessarily find

881
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,640
everything

882
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,600
uh that's wrong with the and you you

883
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,080
you really can't find one 100 everything

884
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,360
that's wrong because there's always

885
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,880
going to be something that maybe is

886
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,440
overlooked but that's that could further

887
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,519
be um you know

888
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,320
that

889
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,840
issue can be fixed if if you do more

890
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,760
than if more than one person goes

891
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,279
through uh

892
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,519
goes through a contest

893
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,760
on that same company on that company uh

894
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,279
assets

895
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,480
so i would recommend sophia

896
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,200
awesome

897
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,720
awesome all right yeah next question we

898
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,760
have is from binary sleeper what are

899
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,360
your thoughts on scoping tests

900
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,240
okay

901
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,320
depending on the scope you're given i

902
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,320
i say

903
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,679
try to

904
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,000
search everything that's in that scope

905
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,600
and obviously try not to go outside of

906
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,640
that scope

907
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,399
um

908
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,039
sometimes maybe there's something that's

909
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,480
vulnerable that's outside of the school

910
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,559
but that's not what

911
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,320
you're there to do you're here to stick

912
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,200
to just that one section and that one

913
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,480
area

914
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,200
where you're uh

915
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,919
of that scope so

916
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,919
make sure that if you're stick if you're

917
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,919
going to stick to uh if you're going to

918
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,519
be assigned a certain scope make sure

919
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,880
that you try and

920
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,360
explore that scope as to the

921
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
to its uh to its max and try to see what

922
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,919
you can really find um and go really in

923
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,840
depth in that defined scope

924
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,240
awesome thank you

925
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,320
and from ghosty thank you

926
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,919
uh how would you deal with checklist

927
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,600
clients the clients that are just doing

928
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,519
the test for a checklist requirement and

929
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,279
have you void critical results from the

930
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,679
report

931
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,840
i would say

932
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,679
try to bring to light how

933
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,320
the critical um the critical points are

934
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,159
that are being made that

935
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,640
that company is trying to overlook

936
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,240
try to bring to light how that can

937
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,840
really damage and impact the company

938
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,960
uh

939
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,120
whether that's you know by

940
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,399
not necessarily but

941
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,640
you could uh

942
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,720
if it's possible to show them a demo of

943
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,600
how

944
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,320
it could really affect the company

945
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,519
then there there may be more likely to

946
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,840
actually understand uh

947
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,440
why it's so important that that point is

948
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,960
being made and why it's important to

949
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,799
look not just overlook that point

950
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,120
awesome

951
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,480
and a

952
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,120
question from ray great talk what made

953
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,360
you interested in this topic

954
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,519
thank you

955
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,720
okay so

956
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,320
uh

957
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,559
a lot of searching into that so we all

958
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,960
know cyber security is a really really

959
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,360
huge field to get into but

960
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,159
at 16 years old 17 years old when i just

961
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,640
started deciding to get into my career i

962
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,799
wanted to find something that was both

963
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,640
fun that i wouldn't mind doing

964
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,799
all the time and that was interesting

965
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,800
and i could constantly learn so i wanted

966
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,560
a balance between something that would

967
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
be fun and something that i would be

968
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,440
able to have a lot of learning

969
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,359
opportunities from

970
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,719
and more

971
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,000
the more i search in the different

972
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
domains of cyber security the more that

973
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,679
i found that this was the one that

974
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,119
suited me best i like being on the

975
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,199
keyboard i like trying to

976
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,760
conduct that break-in and uh

977
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,239
that was personally what i enjoy doing

978
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,199
so that's kind of why i've

979
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,760
that's why i kind of pursued it

980
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,918
makes sense thank you so much your talk
