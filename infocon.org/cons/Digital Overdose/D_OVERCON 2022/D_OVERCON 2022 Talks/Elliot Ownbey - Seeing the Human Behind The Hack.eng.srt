1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,160
are you ready to take it away

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,879
yes i am so hello hello everyone my name

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,200
is elliott owenby i am a technical

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,599
intelligence analyst psychology writer

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,120
and a graduate student in cyber

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,480
psychology today i will be talking about

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
seeing the actual person behind threat

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,800
actors and seeing the human behind the

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,039
hack

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,039
so i'll be covering three things today

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,039
would make it real easy for you first

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,199
thing going to be covering forensic

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,680
psychology talking about

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,079
hackers as cyber criminals the why

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,399
behind they do that think criminal minds

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,000
think mind hunters

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,520
next up i'll be talking about hacker

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,920
culture whether malicious or not there

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,200
is a culture amongst the hacker

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,879
community and we'll be talking about how

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,879
that impacts their motives

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,559
and the last one we'll be talking about

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,399
is the combination of the two of those

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,039
in the field called cyber psychology

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,199
now before we get into it one of the big

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,280
questions a lot of people have is

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,480
why

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
that is a valid question especially for

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
a lot of things the humanities cyber

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,439
psychology is a growing field because

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,920
technology is also growing as well

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,960
technology impacts us sociologically and

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,720
psychologically in ways that we don't

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,159
understand yet

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
and understanding cyber criminals and

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
threat actors on this psychological

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,360
level gives blue teams an incident

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,240
response a new angle to work with when

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,400
you're dealing with high profile crimes

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,880
where let's say the fbi in the united

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,040
states comes in they might develop

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,119
psychological profiles to help get

43
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,920
personal identifiable information

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,439
we don't really have a similar system

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,240
for cyber criminals yet so it's a good

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,320
thing to look into

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,759
first things first

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,720
the forensic psychology

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,439
now a big aspect in forensic psychology

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,600
and psychology as a whole is a concept

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,320
called the big five what the big five is

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
is pretty much five personality traits

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,520
that are easily measurable and when all

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,759
put together gives you a good idea of

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,920
the psyche of a person

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,800
there is openness to experience which is

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,360
pretty self-explanatory it's how willing

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,200
you are to try new things and how

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
creative you are

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,959
this comes with high levels of intellect

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,879
and creativity as i said

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,520
the intellect's weird because it's not

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,319
really like how well you score on a test

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,080
that's not intellect

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
it's your

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
intellectual style so how you are able

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,720
to perceive and remember information

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,640
how does this tie into cyber criminals

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,720
and hackers well an independent

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
psychological study for the journal of

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,400
business ethics here in the united

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,360
states

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,760
uh interviewed and tested multiple

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,319
self-identified white hat gray hat and

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,400
black hat hackers and saw where they

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
scored on the big five

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,879
for openness to experience white and

78
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,599
gray hats were pretty neutral like

79
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,159
nothing too crazy black hat hackers on

80
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,440
the other hand scored very high meaning

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,920
that they were very open to experience

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
almost impulsive

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,959
the impulsivity is co-morbid with some

84
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,040
fragmented thinking and potentially some

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
paranoia like security paranoia but that

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
is also person-to-person

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,720
next on the big five is

88
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,440
conscientiousness and while it is a

89
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
mouthful it pretty much just means how

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,680
responsible and organized you are

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,640
you adhere to societal norms and rules

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,400
and you're also very goal-oriented and

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
hard-working

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,480
white gray and black cats neutral across

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,599
the board

96
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,000
uh hats of all kinds had strong

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,560
perseverance a level of self-efficacy

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,360
however there was that lack of desire

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,599
for total conformity whether it's

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,799
conforming to society via appearances or

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,760
conforming to a typical office job

102
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
agreeableness this is pretty much how

103
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,680
trusting you are in someone being

104
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
altruistic and selfless and also just

105
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,599
being generally moral

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,640
white hat hackers scored very high very

107
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,799
high with their self identification of

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,959
being altruistic there's also a high

109
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,200
focus on inhibition and control from

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
impulsivities

111
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,000
uh

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,319
trends of high and low agreeableness

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,959
amongst black and gray hat hackers

114
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,560
seemed more correlational than

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
causational however there is a level of

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
lack of self-control from inhibitions

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,759
from blackout hackers especially

118
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,759
extroversion is probably one you've

119
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,720
heard of

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
you might have heard the extrovert

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
versus introvert thing

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,320
extrovert is just being

123
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,479
getting energy from social interactions

124
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,040
you are sociable and outgoing generally

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
likable if there's a party people might

126
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
flock to you

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,280
this also comes with high levels of

128
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,759
creative thinking and not only with

129
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,000
extroverts but with ambiverts as well

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
the combination of extroverted

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,280
introverts this combination the ambivert

132
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,360
that was the majority amongst white gray

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,759
and blackhead hackers they are able to

134
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,919
thrive in alone time but also thrive in

135
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,560
social situations which makes sense

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
there is the social aspect of working on

137
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,039
teams or social engineering and there's

138
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,120
the private aspect of sitting alone at

139
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
your computer for hours at an end

140
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
hacking away at something

141
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,440
last of the big five is neuroticism

142
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,080
neuroticism is weird and not might not

143
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
be what you think

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
this can be anything from anger and

145
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,400
anxiety

146
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
irritability self-consciousness

147
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,360
emotional instability depression

148
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,800
this could mean a lot of things

149
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,759
basically nothing too jazzy

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,320
grey hats interestingly scored higher in

151
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,240
neuroticism with more anxiety and

152
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
paranoia than their white and black hat

153
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,919
peers

154
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,759
now that we've covered the big five how

155
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,800
does this tie into forensic psychology

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
well in forensic psychology we have our

157
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,520
own set of personality traits now i'm

158
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,600
going to preface this that none of these

159
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,400
traits guarantee that someone will be a

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,840
hardened criminal and having some or all

161
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,919
of these traits scored really high

162
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,160
doesn't mean you're a criminal nor a bad

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,440
person

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,600
the theory behind the dark tetrad is

165
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
that if someone

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,440
scores high in psychopathy

167
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
machiavellianism narcissism and or

168
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,800
sadism they are more likely to commit

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,440
defense or criminal behavior

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
what is interesting in this regard is

171
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,720
that hedonism power and manipulation

172
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
those are traits that are often comorbid

173
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
with the dark tetrad meaning that if you

174
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,720
have the dark tetrad traits you likely

175
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
might be hedonistic and crave power

176
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
these comorbidities also increase the

177
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
likelihood of cyber stalking according

178
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,639
to independent american psychological

179
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,680
studies

180
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
this is also especially prominent in

181
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
women surprisingly

182
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
women with heightened narcissism

183
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,639
specifically

184
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,800
were significantly more likely to cyber

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
stalk their intimate partners

186
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
with cyber crime as a whole

187
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,160
uh

188
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
hackers with the technical know-how and

189
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,919
also higher than average levels of

190
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,560
psychopathy specifically were more

191
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,880
likely to engage in unethical hacking

192
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,759
so there's a couple existing theories

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,840
with cyber psychology and forensic

194
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,240
psychology the first one is routine

195
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,560
activity theory or rat because that is a

196
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,720
much more fun name

197
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
rat pretty much means you need three

198
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
things for crime to happen you need an

199
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,400
accessible target

200
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,120
when you're online everyone's a target

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,840
that makes it easier number two you need

202
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,759
an absence of a guardian capable of

203
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,840
intervention online

204
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
even easier you don't go to a website

205
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,280
and see a security guard patrolling

206
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
around there's no security cameras on

207
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,800
most websites so there's this lack of

208
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
authority or guardians online third

209
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,240
thing you need is a motivated defender

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,840
online the other two are pretty much

211
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,160
guaranteed so if you want to hack into

212
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,840
something and if you want to be a black

213
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
cat hacker

214
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,080
there's pretty much nothing stopping you

215
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,160
second theory is social learning theory

216
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,240
this one is not necessarily forensic

217
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
psychology but can be easily applied to

218
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
it social learning theory pretty much

219
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
means that your own behavior

220
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
is adopted and modeled from your

221
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,680
environment

222
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,639
let's say you are in a hacker group

223
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,319
malicious or not

224
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,800
that group you will be able to learn

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,599
things that behavior will be encouraged

226
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,280
and when you are encouraged to do a

227
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
certain behavior and learn certain

228
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,680
things

229
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
you're going to want to do it more your

230
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,919
attention retention and reproduction of

231
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,479
certain actions all correlates to your

232
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,399
environment

233
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,559
the last theory is kind of interesting

234
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,200
it's a conflict theory of deviance this

235
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,959
pretty much states that there are social

236
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,800
and economic factors that are at play

237
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,680
that contribute to criminal behavior

238
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,560
a 1956 psychologist wrote the book the

239
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,800
power elite pretty much what this book

240
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,040
says is that there is a small group of

241
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
the rich and influential people at the

242
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,000
top

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,480
executives politicians military leaders

244
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,760
celebrities

245
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,160
basically if you think one percent

246
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,519
that's them

247
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,360
now these one percent people they will

248
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
design society to their rules with

249
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
political pardons lesser taxes however

250
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
with this

251
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,760
uh imbalance of wealth and international

252
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,320
power the lower classes will feel more

253
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,279
enfranchised to commit deviant behavior

254
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,160
one as retaliation and two as means of

255
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,080
survival

256
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
i interviewed multiple people for this

257
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,080
project one of which being jeremy

258
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720
kennelly the manager of analysis at

259
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
mandiant specifically for the financial

260
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
crimes unit

261
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
he stated that the vast majority of

262
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,120
investigative cyber incidents had a high

263
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,200
level of financial motivation

264
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
and that tracks if you think of the

265
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,440
cyber threatscape right now

266
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,920
ransomware is the big thing ransomware

267
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,560
is almost entirely financially motivated

268
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,320
mental illness is definitely something

269
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,200
that is heavily prominent both in

270
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,279
criminal spheres and also cyber security

271
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,640
as a whole

272
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
one big thing is burn out while this

273
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,560
impacts both professionals and criminals

274
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
alike this is definitely one that you've

275
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,079
heard of before

276
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,240
burnout caused from long hours of

277
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,160
isolation and high levels of stress

278
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
meaning that you're less motivated more

279
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,959
irritable just all around overwhelmed

280
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,800
not doing great

281
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
if you imagine how stressed you are as

282
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,399
blue team

283
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,120
red team or even the unethical hackers

284
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,079
might also equally be as stressed

285
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,760
security paranoia is something

286
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,920
interesting so security paranoia is

287
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,399
common with ir individuals and digital

288
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,440
forensics but is also likely uh

289
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,600
prevalent throughout cyber criminals

290
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
this is pretty much your inability to

291
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,880
shut off from that work brain of high

292
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,959
security so you're going to have those

293
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
hype security protocols in your daily

294
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,440
life and trust less people check the

295
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
locks on your doors multiple times be

296
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,360
worried about people watching you

297
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,440
through your browser this also comes

298
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,399
with increased stress

299
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,640
now that was a lot of psychology

300
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,399
let's take a step back step back from

301
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,160
that look at something a little bit fun

302
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,399
let's look at hacker culture as a whole

303
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,000
now you can't look at hacker culture

304
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
without looking at all the books and

305
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,560
movies shows publications everything

306
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,440
that comes out one of the most prominent

307
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
things that helps when looking at hacker

308
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,240
culture is steven levy's 1984 book

309
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,519
hackers heroes of the computer

310
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,720
revolution

311
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
this was the cutting edge time of

312
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
technology and where hackers were really

313
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,959
starting to become a thing so

314
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,480
stephen going around interviewing these

315
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,600
hackers

316
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
groundbreaking

317
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,200
he listed the tenants of hacker groups

318
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,120
pretty much some common themes and

319
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,040
ethics that he saw around

320
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,000
sharing openness decentralization free

321
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,360
access to computers and world

322
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,959
improvement were some of the basic

323
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,720
tenets

324
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,560
he also included things about all

325
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,000
information should be free and that you

326
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,320
should distrust authority and promote

327
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,320
decentralization

328
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,160
the conscious of a hacker now in

329
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,480
researching i could not escape this

330
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,800
short story this was a short story

331
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
written on the ezine frack which was an

332
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,040
internet magazine or ezine which is

333
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
often touted as one of the best and

334
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,920
longest running hacker scenes freaking

335
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,040
anarchy cracking coding all of it was

336
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,800
covered here

337
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,639
the conscious of a hacker was written

338
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,200
shortly after the 1986 arrest of an

339
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,959
anonymous hacker who was named the

340
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,440
mentor who we now know as floyd

341
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
blankenship he was a second generation

342
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,519
member of the hacker group legion of

343
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,760
doom if that rings a bell

344
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,279
the conscience of a hacker has pretty

345
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,440
much been a cornerstone for the hacker

346
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,920
community the short story pretty much

347
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,639
follows this young adult who is bogged

348
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
down with school and the stress of it

349
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
stating that they are much smarter than

350
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,880
their peers and feel like they're just

351
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,399
sort of being

352
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,120
left alone to rot in the corner however

353
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
this young student finds the internet

354
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
finds the hacking communities and feels

355
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,480
at home there but is conflicted because

356
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,279
society law enforcement and his own

357
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,480
mentors

358
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,399
deem these hackers as criminals

359
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,399
lots of the hacker community past

360
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,040
present and likely future really found

361
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,680
themselves in this story they've really

362
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,519
aligned with the conflict that was

363
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,040
happening

364
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,399
and this thinking and conscience of a

365
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,399
hacker aligns with the affirmative

366
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,399
conflict of deviance

367
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,120
uh namely the power elite if you

368
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,560
remember that

369
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,040
if these figures of power as the story

370
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,440
says can lie manipulate and steal

371
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,120
without repercussion

372
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
but the hackers at the bottom of the

373
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,279
barrel are the ones deemed criminals

374
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,120
then they might feel enfranchised to

375
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,920
create their own society online which

376
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,160
they did

377
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,480
next up this was one of my favorite

378
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,880
rabbit holes to go down and honestly

379
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
it's much more important than you would

380
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,959
think the aesthetics and culture of a

381
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,800
hacker community

382
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,000
so you might look at my slides or the

383
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,720
entire digital overdose conflicts and

384
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,079
all the different other hacking

385
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,560
conventions and see some similarities

386
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,040
with the cyberpunk and vaporwave

387
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,399
aesthetics

388
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,800
that actually matters and that tells a

389
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,959
lot about the community

390
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:31,839
let's

391
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,680
stop there for a quick second and take a

392
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,120
look at what cyberpunk even is because

393
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,720
even though you might like recognize

394
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
some of the symbols you might not know

395
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,440
exactly what it entails

396
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,680
cyberpunk can be tied back to a 1984

397
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,480
sci-fi novel called neuromancer

398
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,720
now if you haven't read neuromancer i

399
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,480
highly recommend it

400
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,880
the author previously coined the term

401
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,360
cyberspace in a previous novel however

402
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,800
the use of it neuromancer pretty much

403
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
birthed that word it

404
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,279
skyrocketed in popularity and now

405
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,320
cyberspace is pretty much used daily

406
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,040
uh the novel follows a former hacker now

407
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,199
a low-level hustler who was hired for a

408
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,120
final job bringing him face-to-face with

409
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,399
a powerful ai a shady government

410
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,199
this book has drug use high-tech body

411
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,399
mods tattoos and alternative fashion

412
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,360
uh really detailed and intrinsic slang

413
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,680
as shady governments as i mentioned and

414
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,720
neon lights in a futuristic japan

415
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
if any of that sounds familiar you'd be

416
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,720
right this is pretty much the

417
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,040
instruction booklet of the cyberpunk

418
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,399
aesthetic

419
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,720
neuromancer had it all and the

420
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
aesthetics and the anarchist political

421
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,240
ideologies hackers took that to heart

422
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,759
and they took it to heart so much that

423
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,920
even media in the future still follow

424
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,759
the same trends

425
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,440
now you can't talk about the aesthetics

426
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,920
and culture of hackers without talking

427
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,160
about the movie hackers

428
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,680
this is a 1995 crime film which at the

429
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,639
time

430
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,399
hackers on the internet was still a bit

431
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,199
of an unknown wild west there wasn't a

432
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,800
lot of public information or even

433
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
perception about it

434
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,560
and hackers honestly helped with that

435
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,720
despite it receiving mixed reviews and

436
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,399
honestly kind of flopping at the box

437
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,800
office it became a cornerstone in hacker

438
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,120
culture as a whole the movie follows

439
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,360
high school students with edgy screen

440
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,600
names and alternative fashion defeating

441
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,160
a shitty government with electronic

442
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,560
music and neon lights

443
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,680
so while this movie created this nice

444
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,240
accurate caricature of hacker culture it

445
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,079
also influenced how hacker culture

446
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,160
developed in the future

447
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,399
and its accuracy was no mistake the

448
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,519
screenwriter interviewed multiple cyber

449
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,680
criminals and multipliers of the cast

450
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,440
attended different hacker conventions

451
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,120
now saint jude

452
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,040
not a piece of media saint jude as a

453
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,240
person but it's important to mention her

454
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,000
she was a self-taught programmer and

455
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
civil rights activist in silicon valley

456
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,119
and her real name was judith milhan

457
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,000
she is quoted at saying quote girls need

458
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
modems women may not be great at

459
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,480
physical altercations but we can sure

460
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,439
excel at rapid fire keyboarding

461
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,400
she was noted uh she was the one that

462
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,160
noted that there was a weird lack of

463
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
female hackers at the time and not a lot

464
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
of hacker groups even had any female

465
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,000
members

466
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,760
she also wrote the cipher punk handbook

467
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,080
what exactly cipherpunk is

468
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
we will get there shortly but why am i

469
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,840
even talking about the aesthetics and

470
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,600
culture as a whole

471
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,679
it's weird because technology and art

472
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,559
are almost inextricably related there

473
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,960
are musicians video artists graphic

474
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,559
artists and poets that work with

475
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,039
technology who will call themselves

476
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,480
hackers and be a part of the hacker

477
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
community

478
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,880
computer artists like and non-artist

479
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,200
hackers often both find themselves at

480
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,520
the fringes of society

481
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,360
there is an empathetic relationship

482
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,640
between

483
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,120
people that design experimental music

484
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,480
per se

485
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,080
and those who code their own malware

486
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,039
now let's bounce back to cypherpunk and

487
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,559
politics as a whole

488
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,720
and talk about the political ideologies

489
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
amongst hacker groups

490
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,320
of course a hacker

491
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
that's a large group that encompasses a

492
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,480
lot of people but a lot of the main

493
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,320
themes are about anarchism and

494
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,039
libertarianism especially prominent with

495
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,640
a lot of hacker groups promoting

496
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,120
freeware and open source materials as

497
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,240
well as total internet decentralization

498
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,960
most hacker groups have a strong urge

499
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,559
for rights to privacy and heavily

500
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,039
distrust authority and government

501
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,280
crypto anarchism is synonymous with

502
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,679
cypherpunk which pretty much takes the

503
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,559
anarchist ideals but has a bigger focus

504
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,559
on promoting political and economic

505
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,960
freedom through technology and personal

506
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
use of cryptography which allows for

507
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
being totally anonymous

508
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,400
and more freedom of speech

509
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,240
now there's a cut there's so many hacker

510
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,600
groups out there it's impossible to

511
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,200
cover all of them

512
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,280
i've chosen three groups today to give a

513
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,760
little detail on we have colts the dead

514
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,799
cow anonymous low security cult of the

515
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,120
dead cower cdc contributed to the

516
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,080
development of tor which is the browser

517
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,000
that you use to access the quote-unquote

518
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,240
deep web

519
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
uh cult of the dead cow is one of the

520
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,760
first and longest-running hacker groups

521
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,240
still active to this day as a diy media

522
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,120
group with lots of high prominent

523
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,240
of members a lot of them becoming ceos

524
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,520
or cisos one even being a strong

525
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,280
presidential candidate in the 2020

526
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,960
election

527
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,360
anonymous is definitely one that even

528
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,960
when you're not in tech you've likely

529
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,919
heard the name or seen the guy fox mask

530
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,039
they are famous for combating the church

531
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,160
of scientology in 2008 utilizing ddos

532
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
attacks prank calls and non-violent

533
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,280
protests to urge the irs to remove their

534
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,760
tax-exempt status and also educate

535
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,840
current church members

536
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,320
now why anonymous is interesting is that

537
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,840
they are rather decentralized there's no

538
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,120
one big anonymous it is a large group of

539
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,440
multiple smaller groups and individuals

540
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,280
but what is interesting is that despite

541
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
being decentralized

542
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,200
for the most part

543
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,679
motives and political ideologies

544
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,240
line up they follow the trends of the

545
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,320
thought processes and ethos of hacker

546
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,720
groups as a whole so it's really telling

547
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,440
about the community

548
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,240
love security sort of started as a

549
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,520
little like branch of anonymous

550
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,440
they claimed multiple high high-profile

551
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,960
attacks in their time including the

552
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,520
playstation one back in 2011 and a

553
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,559
temporary outage of the cia website

554
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,840
while they committed multiple

555
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
politically motivated hacks later in

556
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
their life the group pretty much did

557
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,720
everything

558
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
just for fun

559
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,039
however these politically motivated

560
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,440
attacks align more with what cdc and

561
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
anonymous did thus showing

562
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,640
more of how the community as a whole

563
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,360
acts and feels

564
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,520
all right we are almost done here now

565
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,760
we're just gonna work on how this all

566
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,640
ties in together

567
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
with this research there's sort of three

568
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,320
main takeaways

569
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,440
hacker communities criminal or not learn

570
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,600
through community these close

571
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,000
communities can almost act like family

572
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,120
you can encourage certain behaviors

573
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,880
sharing knowledge gaining prestige

574
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,799
amongst the group and mentoring other

575
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,440
members is a perfect way to not only

576
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,559
develop new information but also invite

577
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,159
more members in

578
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,120
it is

579
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,760
a way to build this nice friendly

580
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,240
community where you were also able to

581
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,640
better yourself whether that is through

582
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,880
learning something new or gaining

583
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,159
prestige amongst the cyber criminal ring

584
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,480
with cyber crime specifically

585
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,000
it is

586
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,679
motivated by

587
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,840
multiple factors there is not one single

588
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
factor that causes cyber crime or

589
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,760
deviant behavior as a whole

590
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,280
one of the main things though is

591
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,000
deviance without repercussions as i said

592
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
earlier there's no authority figure

593
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,960
online there's no police security guard

594
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,280
and because of that oftentimes there's

595
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,080
no clear negative consequences

596
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
yes cyber criminals have been arrested

597
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,320
before but think of the ones that have

598
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,720
been arrested versus the slew of them

599
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,240
that haven't

600
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,799
because of this hacks might seem to only

601
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,600
have positive consequences if you're

602
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,360
doing something and only getting the

603
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
good side of it no bad side why would

604
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,240
you stop you're getting goods from this

605
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,159
that reinforces the behavior and

606
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,799
encourages you to keep going

607
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,799
but at the end of the day

608
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,240
hacking in the hacking community as a

609
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,520
whole is a large group it is impossible

610
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,760
to perfectly quantify it into one

611
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,720
specific profile hacker is also not

612
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,919
synonymous with cyber criminal however

613
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,120
cyber psychology is a growing field in

614
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,600
terms of academia it is pretty much in

615
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,919
its infancy i mean how there is

616
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,960
currently

617
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,039
the first official cyber psychology

618
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,159
textbook

619
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,919
from 2019 or 2020 this is a new field so

620
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,840
there is still plenty more research to

621
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,760
be done

622
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,280
but i hope you gained something from

623
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
this today i will open it up to

624
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,880
questions and if you are curious about

625
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,200
my full thesis on it and want to see any

626
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
of my sources for the studies

627
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
i promise the qr code is safe it'll lead

628
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,159
you to a google docs link

629
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,440
i'm now open for questions

630
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,000
okay hi

631
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,200
uh this

632
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
wow okay

633
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,240
first of all let me just

634
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,159
say vaporwave

635
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,480
nice oh yeah

636
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,600
like really

637
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,320
enjoyed the hell out of that slide deck

638
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,279
[Laughter]

639
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,400
um so we've had a few questions and

640
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,600
answers

641
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,120
actually we haven't had the answers yet

642
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,640
but we're going to get that i can give

643
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
those

644
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,360
is age a factor in uh getting in this

645
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,120
no and what you've talked about

646
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,159
yeah age is definitely a factor while

647
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,320
people who are older are definitely not

648
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,480
ruled out or an exception

649
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,200
uh younger people given that they are

650
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,679
sort of born a group of technology are

651
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,760
more likely to find culture and

652
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,919
communities online

653
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,000
and also especially in that pivotal

654
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,679
development age

655
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,880
of young teen to early adulthood one of

656
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,039
the big psychological things happening

657
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,000
is either a desire to fit in or a desire

658
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,799
to identify yourself and that both of

659
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,600
those can easily be found online if you

660
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,959
are not getting it in person

661
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,159
awesome wow that's so cool first off i'd

662
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,520
like to say that this is such an

663
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,360
engaging presentation so thank you so

664
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,440
much for giving it um i'm definitely

665
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,279
going to check out your thesis

666
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,760
uh you do have another question in chat

667
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,000
um from swimleydoo

668
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,679
what role does cyberpsychology play in

669
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,240
your threat intelligence work

670
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,720
threat intelligence work so cyber

671
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,880
psychology for right now with

672
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,039
specifically threat intelligence

673
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,840
works as an assistant in the way so you

674
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,799
still do the technical analysis of

675
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,360
different threats and research whatnot

676
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,919
but the psychological aspect comes in a

677
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,240
lot of different ways in terms of social

678
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,480
engineering that's a very obvious way

679
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,120
social engineering is just psychological

680
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,640
manipulation

681
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,000
there's also the thinking of

682
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
if i were to break into this system

683
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,679
how would i do it let's say i am a

684
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,279
foreign nationalist

685
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,440
i would probably get into a system a

686
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,559
different way

687
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,799
than a financially motivated domestic

688
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,039
cyber criminal so that difference in

689
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,120
criminological profiles is how cyber

690
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,240
psychology plays a role in that

691
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,760
um

692
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,080
small personal question uh if you

693
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,919
are there different profiles depending

694
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,720
on

695
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,080
uh

696
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,480
people that come from a certain area

697
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
that's

698
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
famous for apts which we're not going to

699
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,840
cite

700
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,559
um and people that are from those areas

701
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,559
but that have gone to another country

702
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,159
and then come back

703
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,200
like gotten uh knowledge from another uh

704
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,559
circle i guess

705
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,559
yeah the latter would definitely require

706
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,840
more research and it's definitely

707
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,440
something interesting to look into

708
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,080
however there are geographic trends with

709
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,880
cyber attacks ransomware is more likely

710
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,320
to be used

711
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,000
sourcing from certain countries and

712
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,320
attacking other countries there's also

713
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,520
profiles to to be developed based on who

714
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,200
is being attacked

715
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,480
a foreign nationalist might not attack a

716
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,320
smaller american company that they might

717
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,480
not have heard of but someone local

718
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,080
definitely might

719
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
so there is information to be get from

720
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
geographic regions

721
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,279
awesome

722
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,520
and there is one final small question

723
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,159
awesome is one able to dip into

724
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,400
cyberpsychology from certification

725
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,360
rather like a specialization uh after an

726
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,919
i.t degree or a psychology degree

727
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,799
yeah there is no one like cyber

728
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,799
psychology certificate as of yet however

729
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,080
having just knowledge in psychology and

730
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,640
cyber security whether that is a

731
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,720
psychology degree and a security plus

732
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,159
certification

733
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,039
or a cyber security or computer science

734
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,039
degree with a minor or even just

735
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,520
personal research and psychology that'll

736
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,679
give you a good mix because cyber

737
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,600
psychology it means a lot of things but

738
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,520
at the end of the day it is the blend of

739
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,760
those two fields so however you get

740
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,559
there that'll work

741
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
awesome

742
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,840
well thanks for this

743
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,480
uh

744
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,039
window into hacker culture as well as

745
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,919

746
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,440
