1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,160
hey everyone um glad to be here uh

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,240
thanks nico

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,320
now we have already had two talks to

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,400
great stellar talk site one starting

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,120
about yesterday with tom who covered

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,560
risk 101

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,160
and we had a talk very i think about two

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,920
talks ago

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,000
if that's a measure uh

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,760
with michael hopefully right and he

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,800
covered uh compliance and so so i'm very

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,960
accurately positioned i would say

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,479
because i'm going to be talking about

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,920
how to get started in ngrc and and

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,239
security auditing

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,280
um and without further ado let's jump in

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,520
uh this is me

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
that is the correct way

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,239
of being a wizard

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,640
i'm an assistant manager at the moment i

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,840
have

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,399
i have a cissp i have a cisa if you

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,760
don't know what they'll stand for those

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,280
are certifications

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,399
um

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,480
the ssp is from this company called ifc

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,920
squared

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
stands for certified information systems

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,479
security professional

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,600
cisa is from a company called isaka

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,920
stands for certified information

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
information systems auditor

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,799
and then of course iso 27001 is a type

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,840
of standard uh and then a certified lead

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,840
auditor

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,880
that's me

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,759
uh

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,000
what's what's the agenda

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,560
well we'll start with the what right so

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
so that was my impression of what

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
leonard sounds like might be pretty bad

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,360
uh

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,640
how you fit

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,560
uh what are the skills that are required

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,960
in this particular

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,840
uh let's say territory

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680
what the market looks like and uh

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,079
believe me it's booming

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,000
and what would a potential roadmap be

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,799
like all right now so so all of this

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,119
and almost everything on the agenda are

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,360
things that would need a lot more

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,560
tweaking

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,119
uh per person uh this is just a very

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,439
generic

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,439
introduction let's say to how to get

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,960
started and where to get started at

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,639
yeah and there's a lot of personal

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,440
buyers involved right i started in grc

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,599
um so there is there is that that you

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,000
need to consider but but believe me i

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
feel that it is one of the best places

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
to start at and and it allows you to

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,640
pivot to a lot of other places

65
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
so grc grc is governance risk and

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,359
compliance

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,200
this is from this quote is from

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
a company it's an organization or not

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,120
not for profit called open compliance

70
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,400
and ethics group and so oceg

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,840
and they say

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,680
well it's a bunch of fancy words right

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,840
so i'll just read it out and then i'll

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
i'll talk about what i think it says

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,680
and so the integrated collection of

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,599
capabilities that enable an organization

77
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,680
to reliably achieve

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
objectives address a certainty and act

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,319
with integrity

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,920
now if you understood what grc is from

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
that that's great

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,360
that

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
is a cool definition that is something

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
that you should have on your web page

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,239
uh

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,480
what i feel it is is let's let's let's

87
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,400
go and break down the words right

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,200
uh

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,480
governance by definition

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,319
without using the word govern is to rule

91
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,319
or control that is what a state or a

92
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,400
government or uh

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,319
top heavy organization does right you

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,280
govern

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
uh you establish the rules and you

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,360
control and control the flow you control

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,239
how the policies move things like that

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,040
uh risk uh

99
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
is

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,319
red cross vulnerability but i won't get

101
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,720
into that uh risk is

102
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,599
um

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,120
well well the best way to know what this

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
is is to again hear hear tom quinn's

105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
talk right from from yesterday but then

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,319
for me risk is just

107
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,280
potential of something going bad right

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,879
and then compliance is

109
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
is standard this laws is regulation and

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,040
you trying to meet them and trying to

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
meet them not just because the law

112
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,799
mandates it to be

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,799
um but also trying to meet them because

114
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,680
they

115
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,920
help you get more secure

116
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,319
uh to an extent and and so there's a

117
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,599
huge war that has fought on that so

118
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,799
we'll not get into the politics of

119
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
whether compliance makes you secure or

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,200
not

121
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,440
but then that is why it was meant and

122
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,680
that is how it started that was how the

123
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,240
goodwill initially had

124
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,560
uh behind the word compliance right and

125
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,880
again stellar talk by michael about

126
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
about how

127
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,880
about two hours ago i guess so so

128
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,479
it really goes into compliance so again

129
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,280
i won't really dive deep into that one

130
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,520
um but then it is these three things

131
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,040
come together

132
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
and

133
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
it's it's the knowledge of how to

134
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,320
control how to move and how to rule it's

135
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,720
the knowledge of recognizing what might

136
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,800
be potentially bad and how to prioritize

137
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
it and it's all to recognize what is

138
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,720
required

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,199
uh for you to protect and versus what is

140
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,880
not required for you to protect or what

141
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,960
is less required for you to protect

142
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
um which is which is what compliance

143
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,199
defines

144
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,080
um

145
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,919
jumping into the fit right so this is

146
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,520
the fit and so this color wheel is is uh

147
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,919
well i have taken it from uh two folks

148
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,240
april wright and proxy blue

149
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,759
they created this wheel and that they're

150
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,440
too many colors usually there are only

151
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
three or two colors that we usually talk

152
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
about we talked the blue team and the

153
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,520
red team

154
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,320
and this is uh this is a lot more colors

155
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
believe me not not all of us use these

156
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,240
colors it's just a fancy way of showing

157
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,639
where you fit

158
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,400
and so the blue team is defensive and

159
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
then of course you can read through it

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
uh but what we are going to talk about

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
or what i am going to talk about

162
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,960
specifically is the white team right the

163
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
guys in the middle

164
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,199
uh

165
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,240
and

166
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,199
by being in the middle you

167
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,560
and so this is what i feel is the

168
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,919
advantage right

169
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,240
it's great to have technical skills it

170
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,880
will absolutely help you out if you have

171
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,960
them but it's not something that you

172
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,520
need to start off with

173
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,080
whereas in almost all the other except

174
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,160
the orange team i guess

175
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,120
and all the other colors you need you

176
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,280
absolutely need to be skilled at some

177
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,199
tools some process some methodology to

178
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,800
even begin

179
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,360
um and so this is where i feel that my

180
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
team or or grc or security auditing

181
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,120
is a good place to start off at and then

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
you can decide where to specialize into

183
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,359
it

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,319
moving ahead uh pyramids pyramids

185
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,880
everywhere uh everyone likes pyramids

186
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
and usually it's a cia triad i know the

187
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,919
picture is not good uh which is which is

188
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,600
because i uh

189
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,199
didn't spend a lot of time in adjusting

190
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,639
the aspect ratio

191
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,600
so uh but then um i can read it out to

192
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,759
you so on the very top is business

193
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,759
drivers and and you need to understand

194
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,400
right

195
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,720
uh we we sit at a very good position of

196
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,599
power

197
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,039
we are the guys

198
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,280
who basically goes up to the business

199
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
and we convince them to spend money on

200
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,199
the security team

201
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,840
that is our job

202
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,520
literally to convert something so

203
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,280
technical that that someone from the

204
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
finance background may not be able to

205
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,199
understand to convert it straight into

206
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,440
money and impact so that they say oh

207
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
that is a loss that i'm not willing to

208
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,000
bear

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,479
and hey you know i'll pump money into it

210
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,199
that is what we do most of us

211
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,280
uh so at the very top is the business

212
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,240
drivers

213
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,880
right below it is a strategy that drives

214
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,479
uh

215
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,120
the risk statement the risk uh appetite

216
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,919
and all those risk jargons

217
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,000
uh right below that is uh governance

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,919
so the policies and standards and

219
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,080
frameworks and what you should follow

220
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
um what are we required to follow right

221
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,599
if you're in the finance industry for

222
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,759
example if you're taking any sorts of

223
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,840
let's say credit card payments

224
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,800
um

225
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,440
you need to follow pci dss like you're

226
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
mandated by law you won't be allowed

227
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
right so pcids stands for

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,039
a payment card industry data security

229
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,800
standards a bunch of these companies a

230
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,240
bunch of major card companies came

231
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
together decided we need a standard to

232
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
regulate everyone who does business with

233
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,479
us

234
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,520
um

235
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,199
all right and then right below is of

236
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,919
course risk identification and profiling

237
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,400
uh scoping is what what what another

238
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,879
word would be for it and then

239
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,840
right below it comes all the uh

240
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
the more operational strategical and

241
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,000
technical details right so processes and

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,759
operational procedures

243
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,759
tools and technology right in the middle

244
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,199
and then people and organization

245
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,120
management

246
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
and then each of these three boxes are

247
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,919
you can visualize them as separate

248
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,958
departments of their own right

249
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,919
so

250
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,640
operational procedures

251
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
operations managing operations building

252
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,880
business processes

253
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
maintaining them

254
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
could could be the job of one department

255
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
tools and technology now this is where i

256
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,959
t pops up right

257
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,920
so

258
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,160
and a lot of companies don't necessarily

259
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,920
have the tools

260
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,440
depending on what how big they are

261
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
honestly that they may not have a

262
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,040
separate security team or separate risk

263
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
team right maybe it falls all on the

264
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
head of idt

265
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,360
or perhaps a legal team

266
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,959
and so that is where the tools and

267
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
technology and and great if you have the

268
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,880
expertise right but but you see how many

269
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
boxes there are that

270
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,959
don't require technical expertise in a

271
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,959
tool

272
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,640
that is exactly why it is easier to

273
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,959
start off in grc and then gain technical

274
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,279
skills as you move up the ladder

275
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
and and then switch wherever you want to

276
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,560
go right and then of course people

277
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
management organization management

278
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,640
a lot of times security is considered

279
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,399
security department is considered as a

280
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,200
people who say no to everything

281
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,839
and uh well that might be true right

282
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,200
but then that is something you need to

283
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
break and that is where you will find

284
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,040
that people skills come super useful

285
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,480
the number of times you have to get

286
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,760
people on a call from different

287
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,880
engagements and believe me they see risk

288
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,120
and they'll see security as something in

289
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
addition to what they do normally right

290
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
so let's say

291
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,279
uh you're you're in human resources

292
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,320
right

293
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,160
you're on boarding all these new people

294
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,680
you're off-boarding the new people uh

295
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
the people who are leaving and stuff

296
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,079
like that

297
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,839
and then you get up to them and say hey

298
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,079
you know we need to do an audit for you

299
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,240
and all that audit is extra work for

300
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,079
them so you need to kind of convince

301
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,760
them as to why they need to do it in the

302
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,160
first place

303
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
and of course

304
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,440
in an ideal world everyone would

305
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
understand why it is needed but for them

306
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
it's all extra arts it's extra effort

307
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
it's extra

308
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,440
questions to be answered right and so

309
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,839
you need to have those people's skills

310
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,240
super helpful um especially if you're

311
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,079
coming from something like uh let's say

312
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,399
a sales background or a customer

313
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,800
services background so things like um

314
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
even

315
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,000
like a customer service representative

316
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
or if you were

317
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,959
let's say you were a server at a

318
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,200
restaurant right you know how to handle

319
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
i rate customers

320
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,120
now these won't be exactly customers but

321
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
it will be a similar kind of working

322
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,800
environment they won't be irate but they

323
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,399
they will always

324
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,880
or in most cases look at you with uh hey

325
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
you know i don't need all this work

326
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,640
so it's good to have those skills and

327
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,800
then at the very end is reporting and

328
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,640
monitoring and continuous compliance and

329
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,560
stuff like that

330
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,680
um that is basically each layer of the

331
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,959
of

332
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,600
of what grc comprises that

333
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,399
and

334
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,480
and a better visual right if you want to

335
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,720
see where it stands and and you know

336
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,399
let's say if your

337
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,839
organization is a big big

338
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,880
organism right the grc ideally the grc

339
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,560
is supposed to be informing the board of

340
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,120
directors as to what they should do and

341
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,279
how they should run the company and then

342
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,839
those orders trickle down all the way to

343
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,600
the bottom that is how

344
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
grc should work

345
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,200
whether it is working like that or not

346
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,040
is a different question

347
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,240
but that is how it should work

348
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,399
so we dive into what uh skills you will

349
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,399
need to get into it right

350
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,000
um

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,760
or things that define your art things

352
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,560
that would define you and you'll see

353
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,320
out of the four things that are listed

354
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
three of them are

355
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,279
generic

356
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,920
they are not tied to i.t they are not

357
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,480
tied to security they can be

358
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,560
gained from any aspect possible right

359
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,760
it doesn't matter what your previous

360
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
role was if you were a student if you

361
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,279
were if you were in real estate it

362
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,959
doesn't really matter you will need

363
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,200
communication you will need to know how

364
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,839
to build up relationships and so you'll

365
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,600
see i've written clients below it and

366
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,680
i'll get to that in a moment it's not

367
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,760
always clients it can be internal you

368
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,320
can be in an internal facing role

369
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,920
and then you need to have good project

370
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,440
management because you'll be running

371
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,800
and then again i'll get to the rules in

372
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,320
a minute but then you'll be running

373
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,200
multiple kinds of projects year over

374
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,880
year depending on what kind of uh

375
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,240
company you're working in and what kind

376
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,279
of market that company operates right

377
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,440
because of differences and compliances

378
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
so three out of four skills

379
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,839
super non-technical uh

380
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,720
super experiential or at least can be

381
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,800
gained through various transitive areas

382
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,160
right

383
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,000
um

384
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,519
uh

385
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,639
and then coming to the first one

386
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,680
continuing education so that is courses

387
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
uh certifications

388
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,760
and that is uh that is something that

389
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
either time or money

390
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,519
uh

391
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,000
would would kind of hold you back right

392
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
uh

393
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,199
i wouldn't

394
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,399
i wouldn't

395
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,680
really

396
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,519
advise you to pay a lot for your

397
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,199
certifications unless you have a job in

398
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,720
that field

399
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,079
and then we'll get to certifications in

400
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,720
one of the later slides but then you

401
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,279
need to be on your toes it's not that

402
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,760
you once you're in you can stop studying

403
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,560
you have to keep studying because that

404
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,399
the field changes at a very rapid space

405
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,199
right

406
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,480
and even though you are sitting in the

407
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,240
middle translating things you need to

408
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
know what changes have happened on

409
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,480
either side so on the business end and

410
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
on the security side on the more uh

411
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,639
practical security side

412
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,320
and so you need to have continuing

413
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,839
education you cannot skip on that

414
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,040
this is where i was talking about the

415
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,120
roles right and so there are majorly two

416
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,959
roles and uh

417
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,720
and i'm quickly getting into a market

418
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
here right

419
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,720
uh

420
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,639
you can be an analyst or a specialist

421
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,560
and this is more of an internal facing

422
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,639
role

423
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,399
and uh okay so the uh

424
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,399
something i need to make clear right

425
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,079
the job roles that are there on linkedin

426
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,680
or indeed or any of the job search

427
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
websites that you use right

428
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,240
um

429
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,839
they are not

430
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,440
down to a pattern right they'll write

431
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,639
anything over there so you'll have to go

432
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,920
in and read the

433
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,079
uh job responsibilities i mean if

434
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,519
they're right analyst but it could be

435
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,839
for a company that does consulting

436
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,320
uh don't don't go by this right what

437
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,800
what i mean by the words in here and and

438
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
what those words mean there are two

439
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,760
different things what i mean by an

440
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,360
analyst or specialist is something

441
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
someone who's an internal to the company

442
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,040
all the people that you interact with

443
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,399
are also people in that company

444
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,920
and by that logic you would have fewer

445
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
projects to deal with each project would

446
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,440
run for a longer time because you know

447
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
internal projects are like that and you

448
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,560
would get a

449
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,480
holistic exposure and what i mean by

450
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,399
that is you get to see your project end

451
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,880
to end right from where it's how it

452
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,600
started which business unit wanted it

453
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,279
all the way up to how it affects the

454
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,519
next project that you go and work on

455
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,440
right

456
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,040
as opposed to being a consultant right

457
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,399
and so a consultant again is not a

458
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,560
contract role necessarily it can be it

459
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,320
cannot be it depends on you and it

460
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,680
depends on the company that's employing

461
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,720
you

462
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,440
but a consultant role is where you get

463
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,040
multiple projects they are all very

464
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,199
short so short means usually four to six

465
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,320
weeks

466
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
and you get focus exposure on doing the

467
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,839
exact same thing over and over and over

468
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,639
again with in multiple markets right so

469
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,639
um for example you do a cyber security

470
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,399
assessment or you do a cyber security

471
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,959
audit for as a consultant right

472
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,759
you would do the exact same piece you

473
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,639
like

474
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,360
audit the exact same standard over and

475
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,440
over again for multiple companies it one

476
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,040
one could be a

477
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,959
mattress manufacturing farm one could be

478
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,279
a pet food firm one could be a

479
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,519
automobile firm each time you go in four

480
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,959
to six weeks you do your engagement and

481
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,480
you're out

482
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
gives you a very focused exposure but

483
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,399
gives you a lot of markets to cover

484
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,320
so you pick and choose where you want to

485
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,360
establish yourself

486
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,920
this was just a simple search i did uh

487
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
some time ago right and um you'll see

488
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,079
i've linked another person down below

489
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,800
it's uh stuart stewart writes absolutely

490
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,120
great things on drc so good person to

491
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,160
follow

492
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
um and and connect

493
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
so and it's so one this is from one of

494
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,360
his statistics actually um

495
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,600
so i i searched it governance analyst on

496
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,480
linkedin and approximately 400 000 jobs

497
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,119
popped up worldwide

498
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,000
and that is just in within a month

499
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
this is and so i didn't use all the

500
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,079
filters right

501
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,160
this kind of shows how many and then i

502
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
can tweak the words right i could write

503
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,079
cyber security at least i could write uh

504
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,280
i could write

505
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
security assessor i could write risk

506
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,640
manager i could write risk analysts you

507
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
know all those keywords you commute them

508
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,000
inside and then you'll get different

509
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,440
type of results just because of it

510
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,080
that's way that's how searching works

511
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,480
there is a lot of space there are a lot

512
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,840
of roles

513
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,559
uh available right may not they may not

514
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,799
all be entry level they may not all let

515
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,880
you in at zero or one years of

516
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,000
experience

517
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
uh or direct experience but then there

518
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
are they are there all right

519
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,799
and so and so

520
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,799
i'll come back to this one in a moment

521
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
how do you relaunch yourself right and

522
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,080
so a relaunch or launch depending on

523
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,440
whether you're a student or you're

524
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
coming in

525
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
you're either you're fresh to the

526
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,880
industry is what i mean or or you have

527
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,559
some transitive experience from other

528
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,200
places right

529
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,440
so you look at whatever you have done up

530
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,840
till now right

531
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,480
you find what is common between what you

532
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,760
have done and whatever job

533
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,080
responsibilities have

534
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,240
been written down in in one of those

535
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
search terms right scope of the market

536
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,760
see what is common with what you already

537
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
do

538
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,720
what you have already done and what they

539
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
ask you off right so let's say there are

540
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,039
10 check boxes in the job responsibility

541
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,120
and you know three of them because

542
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
they're from your last role

543
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,640
highlight those on your portfolio

544
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,559
highlight those on your resume and for

545
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,960
the remaining seven

546
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,720
if i use 10 as the example for the

547
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,559
remaining seven

548
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,320
see how much you can learn

549
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,200
right let's see how much you can and

550
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,640
this is what

551
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,000
this is what we come here right see how

552
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,760
much you're passionate about and see how

553
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,919
much you can feasibly learn and feasible

554
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,160
is a very important word here

555
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,200
and what

556
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,679
what it means is i'm not doubting your

557
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,480
ability to learn

558
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,480
it is so it is it is kind of a

559
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,919
like the amount of risk you can take

560
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,240
right it's like a cost benefit analyst

561
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
analysis

562
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,679
and i should not use the same things

563
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,039
over and again

564
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,480
but then it is

565
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,960
it is something you do with your life uh

566
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,720
you figure out whether spending all that

567
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,400
time and money would get you that kind

568
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,640
of return on your investment

569
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
uh and and be very cold about it right

570
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,000
now

571
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,080
you don't want to be spending money

572
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,160
until you start making money and and you

573
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,679
don't want to be spending a lot of it

574
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,280
and then find out that you're not making

575
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,039
as much of it back

576
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,960
so have those two things very clear in

577
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,880
your head when you um

578
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,400
when you start off and you start making

579
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,080
your roadmap

580
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,520
right

581
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,559
um

582
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,320
figure out from those let's say and

583
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,919
again going back to that 10 job

584
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,000
requirements thing right figure out from

585
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,240
those 10 which ones are the ones that

586
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,600
you are passionate really passionate

587
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
about uh figure out which ones are the

588
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,280
ones that you can feasibly learn within

589
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,799
a month two months three months give

590
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,320
yourself a time you know and then the

591
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
time matters on how your uh finances are

592
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,480
so you'll have to do that yourself

593
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,360
um

594
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,039
and everyone is in a different spot so i

595
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,720
cannot give you exact time frame and how

596
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,480
many months will you be done or in how

597
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,039
many days will you be done right

598
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,400
but that is something you will be able

599
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,760
to do

600
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,280
quite easily because you do that for all

601
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,159
your other aspects in life right

602
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,000
um and then finally touching on

603
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,799
certifications

604
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,760
i'm not endorsing these

605
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
these are only based on what i have

606
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,440
found in job job recommendations

607
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,960
and job responsibilities and job

608
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,039
requirements

609
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,200
and so so security plus is absolute

610
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
basic starter certificate right

611
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,840
get it if you

612
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
i would for so so this is a blanket

613
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
suggestion for all all certifications

614
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,520
all right

615
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,480
read read about them study them

616
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,919
and then decide whether you want to pay

617
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,919
for the exam or you want to pay for the

618
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,760
training tutoring right

619
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,679
almost for all of them you'll find a lot

620
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,200
of free

621
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,760
material okay all of them

622
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,240
uh i know i personally know boot camps

623
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,400
that run for cssp that are free

624
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,840
and cssp is like a 600 exam right so you

625
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,679
don't want to

626
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,760
you don't want to waste those dollars

627
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
uh you don't want to get a training that

628
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,280
does not help you clear

629
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,159
so i would suggest get a mentor or get

630
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,559
join a study group and believe me there

631
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,480
are for each one of these that i have

632
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
listed and many more there are free

633
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,760
uh boot camps out there that are worth

634
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,600
their salt right just because they're

635
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,400
free doesn't mean that they're not good

636
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,559
um all right i won't go here i'll go

637
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,400
back i'll go back to my

638
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,200
um the job the job thing right so i have

639
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,919
i have written down some some

640
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,159
top skills that i found from searching

641
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,400
right

642
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,200
a lot of them say this

right these are these these are from

actual responsibility right

656
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,440
um you see how

657
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,760
a lot of them are so common and these

658
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
were these are separate search words

659
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,039
believe me so the first one was i.t

660
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,400
governance the second one was cyber

661
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,320
security compliance and the third one i

662
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,760
forget what the third one was but all of

663
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,120
them were different search words but

664
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,880
these were the top 10 skills from each

665
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,799
of them right and then i'll get into the

666
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,240
summer of the more technical ones right

667
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,919

668
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,520

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,720
just study for a certificate right don't

678
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,240
give it i'm not saying give it just

679
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
study for it

680
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,880
um

681
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
behavior measure improvements and

682
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,919
awareness behavior and culture right

683
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,600
which is essentially performance

684
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,880
measurements

685
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,360
which uh isn't something very technical

686
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,200
you just need to know

687
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
what common metrics are

688
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,799
and how people performance can be

689
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,400
measured which is again a very easy

690
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,480
thing to read up

691
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,200
uh and so

692
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,520
look at the end of it what what i really

693
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,200
want to say is a lot of them will have a

694
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,640
lot of overlap with all the things that

695
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,240
you have already been doing even if

696
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,520
you're a complete student right uh

697
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,640
all right let's let's take the most

698
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,000
and i'm not saying this is a radical

699
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
scenario but then let's take one where

700
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,520
you don't have a degree all right and

701
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,960
and then you'll see a lot of these jobs

702
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
saying hey you need a degree

703
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,400
how do you get around those requirements

704
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,799
right you don't you you just high school

705
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,279
right that's it

706
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,440
you can get around them with

707
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,039
certificates you can get around them

708
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,480
with internships you can get around them

709
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
with apprenticeships you can get around

710
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,960
them with being extremely active on

711
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,159
linkedin

712
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,320
uh

713
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,000
and networking believe me will help you

714
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,080
a lot

715
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,840
sometimes those requirements don't make

716
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,200
sense sometimes you may

717
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,120
you may take only five out of those ten

718
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,720
boxes that is fine

719
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,360
uh believe me i have sent applications

720
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,400
uh

721
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
even if i'm even if i pick like three or

722
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,799
four of them i'll send them because it's

723
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,440
their job to say no and not mine

724
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,120
if they say no that's fine

725
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,600
if they say yes then it's great

726
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,480
uh that is where i usually am at

727
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,159
um

728
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,039
i know i'll be reaching the 25 mark very

729
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,960

and that's about it uh

738
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,760
turning it over to you nico

739
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,480
awesome now we've had a few questions um

740
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,000
do you want to take the first one uh

741
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,320
even

742
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,720
i remember to unmute this time yeah we

743
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,440
do have quite a few questions sure

744
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,279
uh question number one

745
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,360
should grc slash audit people look

746
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,919
towards a jack of all trades or general

747
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,159
skill set rather than specialize and if

748
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,159
so how should they develop and maintain

749
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,760
that range of knowledge required

750
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
what was the first part the c slash what

751
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,679
was that

752
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,360
ah it says should grc and audit people

753
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,039
look towards a jack of all trades

754
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,400
general a skill set rather than

755
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,720
specialize and if so how should they

756
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,919
develop and maintain the range of

757
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,679
knowledge required

758
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,520
right that's an excellent one uh that is

759
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,440
also something i struggled with about

760
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
two or three years ago

761
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,279
i would say

762
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,200
uh the g uh so from so again from grc

763
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,919
right

764
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,720
there's

765
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,159
there are a lot of compliances in the

766
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,919
market depending on what market you go

767
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,880
to

768
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
uh and there are a lot of uh there is a

769
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,960
lot of ways in which you can govern and

770
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,520
usually usually learn governing or

771
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,799
ruling as as as i should say um only by

772
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,880
experience i would say focus on the r

773
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,080
right

774
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,679
get any compliance it doesn't matter as

775
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,120
long as you can

776
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,480
identify and quantify risk properly you

777
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,039
will be able to pick up any standard any

778
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,279
framework just learn whatever jargon

779
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,279
whatever elements are in there and

780
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,360
you'll be able to go forward very

781
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,520
quickly all you need to know all you

782
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,679
really need to know is being good at the

783
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
risk part

784
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,159
um

785
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,000
and so for risk specifically if you want

786
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,520
to know uh there are there are a couple

787
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,799
of frameworks out there that are

788
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,039
established there is there is a fair

789
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,880
framework there is octave

790
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,240
there there's of course nist and all the

791
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,720
other guys but fair and octave are much

792
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,600
more

793
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,039
mathematical

794
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,240
so

795
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,400
much more

796
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
measurable i would say does that answer

797
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,520
the question that does thank you and how

798
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,880
would someone get their foot in the door

799
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
with grc or make a career switch from a

800
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,960
cyber role

801
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,880
um if you're coming from a cyber role

802
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,840
it's it's

803
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,360
it's easier

804
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,399
if

805
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,399
and so the reasons why it is easier is

806
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,760
you could get into uh

807
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,000
you could you could get into how would

808
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,880
you

809
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,480
you could actually just read the reports

810
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,360
that your lead whatever role you are in

811
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,080
whatever whoever you are

812
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,960
let's say under um who are supervising

813
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,120
you what whatever reports that they send

814
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,200
up you could just try to see and read

815
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,880
those reports and see what is actually

816
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
reported to the management right

817
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,760
and then try to uh reverse engineer what

818
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,039
is it that you

819
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,039
did versus what got reported right and

820
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,240
then you can see the

821
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,279
um you can see the place where they meet

822
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,600
if you're completely new uh which is

823
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,039
which is what i was

824
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,480
um

825
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,080
you could go the education route that is

826
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,159
that is like the easy but but requires

827
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,440
money route

828
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,679
um

829
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,000
so you could just get degree degree and

830
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,760
then do a couple of certificates you'll

831
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,320
get a job you will get a job all right

832
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,000
it just depends how good you are on

833
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,840
telling people that you did something

834
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,880
let's say you don't want to go the

835
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,200
education route you could uh you could

836
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,399
go

837
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,120
uh

838
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,360
so a lot of people i mentor go the help

839
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,120
desk crowd right so they they start off

840
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,880
in help desk and you need to believe

841
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,960
this right you need to

842
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,360
know that every every job you take until

843
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
you get the job in your field that you

844
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,200
want all of them all the other previous

845
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,880
jobs will be just launching pads right

846
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,240
you do them for three months you get the

847
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,840
experience to get out

848
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,679
no loyalty no need to have

849
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,120
not a good thing i should say but no

850
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,279
need to have loyalty right now if if you

851
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,520
want to get to a place that you

852
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,679
feel is where you should be at that is

853
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,919
your end goal get there and then stick

854
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,360
for a couple of years

855
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,600
but then until then just grab three four

856
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,120
years of experience even if it pays

857
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,000
maybe

858
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
minimum

859
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,120
wage right just grab that experience

860
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,320
know that you're gonna do it only for

861
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,600
three four months

862
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,440
and then get out then go to the next

863
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,679
role you'll get about 30 to 40 percent

864
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,279
hike each time you get out rather than

865
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,919
staying there which is about 12 percent

866
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,559
hike right so you know jumping is

867
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,240
rewarded more

868
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,399
and so that is a good way to get in

869
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,799
start from a helper scroll or an id role

870
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,919
and then

871
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,039
wedge your way forward awesome thank you

872
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,559
so much that was such an excellent

873
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,480
answer nicos would you like to take the

874
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,799
next uh question

875
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,399
uh yes

876
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,679
so

877
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,480
uh

878
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,320
someone asked the question going i see

879
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,399
from time to time people asking for help

880
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,640
to get into grc

881
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,919
when you look for g security or grc jobs

882
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,240
uh most jobs say you need x amount of

883
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,640
years of experience right

884
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,399
however you can't get that experience

885
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,600
without getting the job in the first

886
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,640
place shaken and egg

887
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,399
what would you recommend to get that

888
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,080
first securities uh jrc job

889
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,159
right um

890
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,240
excellent right and so it kind of ties

891
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,399
back not exactly but it kind of ties

892
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,440
back with my previous answer right um

893
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,000
your your first grc role might not be

894
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,760
the first role you do

895
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,440
right it might be the third role you

896
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,600
picked up in the journey of roles right

897
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,840
uh all right i'll give you a personal

898
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,760
example um

899
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
and so this is what all right i'll give

900
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,679
you a redacted version of a personal

901
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,600
example because it's not my example it's

902
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,919
someone else's example

903
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,640
but then so this person started off in

904
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,960
uh one wanted to get into grc

905
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,520
they started off with uh i think they

906
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,399
were

907
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,960
what they were doing was they were

908
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,039
selling phones i believe

909
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,159
um

910
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,919
i think that was their role

911
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,000
and so they had a lot of transitive

912
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,679
experience of salesmanship right but

913
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,960
they didn't want to get into something

914
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,120
like pre-sales which are also a viable

915
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,200
option in cyber they wanted to get into

916
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,399
pure grc right um and so

917
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,840
what what i told them was instead of

918
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,679
being dejected with an experience that

919
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,200
says hey you know we need two pursuits

920
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,960
of experience or we need three plus

921
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,399
years of experience still apply to those

922
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,720
roles right but try to uh try to find

923
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,399
out who posted that role in the first

924
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,000
place

925
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,960
and

926
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,399
are there are a couple of things that

927
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,880
work behind the scenes right uh there is

928
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,200
a person who posts the role who might

929
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,440
not exactly know what the role is about

930
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,600
uh depending on how the company works

931
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,720
inside

932
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,679
uh there they might just copy paste a

933
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,760
requirement which happens a lot believe

934
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,399
me in the market that i am in uh like

935
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,159
they'll they'll they'll say three to

936
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,440
seven year three to five years of

937
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,960
experience and then they'll ask they'll

938
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,200
ask a whole suit of things that i

939
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,279
probably know only five percent off and

940
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,760
i would be like who knows all of that

941
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,080
uh like which one person knows all of

942
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,679
that right and then if they actually

943
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,360
know would they really come and work for

944
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,000
you

945
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,720
right

946
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,159
um

947
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,519
so

948
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,279
my answer would be try to get in touch

949
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,039
with whoever posted that role and see if

950
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,200
you can have a conversation with them

951
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
see if you can get them to take a chance

952
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,360
on who you are as a person rather than

953
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,960
just your resume

954
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,399
which probably says zero years of

955
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,720
experience or one year of experience

956
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,519
right uh that would be uh probably point

957
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,960
one uh a much more uh

958
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,039
a much more better thing would be to

959
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,519
look up uh apprenticeship programs right

960
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,679
depending on where you are and uh this

961
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,559
is

962
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,960
uh more locked in this is much this gets

963
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,880
much more competitive not that

964
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,799
everywhere else isn't competitive but

965
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,519
then you could try for sans runs and

966
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,480
program for them apprentices i believe

967
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,840
um

968
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,120
a lot of universities have it um

969
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,919
if you know someone or or or let's say

970
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,399
you have

971
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,039
a relative who has worked at a

972
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,120
university or some place like that you

973
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,799
can see if they can put in a good word

974
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,240
for you universities always have a lot

975
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,559
of jobs that don't pay that great

976
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,080
but then are good for experience

977
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,399
collection and i would say that again

978
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,480
going back to the previous answer right

979
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,880
don't don't think that grc might be the

980
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,640
first role you get

981
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,159
just do a three-month job at fifty

982
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,640
dollars an hour then do the next job and

983
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
say say like hey you know i had three

984
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
months of experience i would want to

985
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
switch to a better role this is where i

986
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,279
want to go do you think uh you know

987
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,120
would you would you have something like

988
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,279
this for me if they don't uh go to

989
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,440
whatever role you applied to get that

990
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,640
height maybe 15 you go to 20 an hour uh

991
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,720
and you keep jumping till you either get

992
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
to an employer where you want where you

993
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,440
know

994
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,799
that the employer recognizes your

995
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,880
contributions and is is ready to say

996
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,159
like hey you know i know you are in help

997
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,240
desk i know you wanted to get into grc

998
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,679
you have a position open we would rather

999
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,919
hire internally than hire from outside

1000
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,380
which is cheaper for a company

1001
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,240
[Music]

1002
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,559
or you find the role which you wanted to

1003
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,480
right your first erc role but it's just

1004
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,399
remember your first erc rule may not be

1005
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,639
your first role in security itself your

1006
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,320
first role maybe maybe you went through

1007
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,960
three four roles before
