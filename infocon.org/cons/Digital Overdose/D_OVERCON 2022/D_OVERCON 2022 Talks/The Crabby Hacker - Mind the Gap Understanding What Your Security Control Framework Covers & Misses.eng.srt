1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,599
ahoy there

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,040
call me crappy

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,560
and today i'll be delivering a talk

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,160
titled mind the gap

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,080
where i'll be helping you get a better

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,760
understanding of what your security

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,080
control framework might not cover for

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,000
your organization

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,279
let's get started

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,400
at times security is a kind of sailing

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,760
in both cases

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,199
you are

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,039
assisting with

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,920
steering an entity towards its intended

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
destination safely

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,920
whether it be an

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,719
organization or a ship

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,640
in the case of sailing

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
you may be

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,320
on the lookout for dangerous conditions

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
that could affect the journey

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,280
things like

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,000
stormy weather hidden rocks

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,120
and of course

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,280
kraken attacks

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,600
before you see security is akin to

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,680
sailing when sea monsters are thrown

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,160
into the mix

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
and for the ill-fitted ship that doesn't

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,520
have the capability to spot these

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,960
dangers

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,239
or

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,360
proper defenses to fight back

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,560
or even

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,720
the escape plan

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,119
if things goes out they may find that

37
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,200
their journey will come to

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
an abrupt end

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
so how does

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,400
how is this similar to securing an

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
organization

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,880
well

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
for organization that does not have the

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,799
proper procedures in place

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,920
they too may find themselves not

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,799
able

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,520
to

48
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,360
defend against attackers

49
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,200
if they are sought out as a target of

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,600
opportunity

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
and the attack vectors are several

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,600
from things like insider threats

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,799
to

54
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,280
software variabilities to

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,079
phishing attacks

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,520
and similar to how a ship it may be

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
doomed if it suffers a

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,920
major breach in its hull

59
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,000
an organization may be doomed after

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,640
suffering one or several data breaches

61
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,479
so what is an organization supposed to

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,280
do

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,038
to stay afloat

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,280
and try to navigate these treacherous

65
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,040
waters

66
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,080
well

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
one thing they can do is be

68
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,280
strategic

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
and the security data to implement

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,440
within your organization

71
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,040
this is where control frameworks come

72
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,560
into the picture

73
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,440
simply put they are a collection of

74
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,959
recommended actions

75
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
that aim to reduce the frequency and

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,239
impact of harmful events

77
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,319
and such one example of a control would

78
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
be something like establish and maintain

79
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,360
detailed enterprise asset inventory

80
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,879
by doing so

81
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,760
an organization will gain a better sense

82
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
of what

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,120
devices do they own

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
and what they can do to limit

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
the amount of exposure they have

86
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,159
and

87
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,680
oftentimes

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,560
organizations are driven by necessity to

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
adopt a framework

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
simply because it might be something

91
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,599
due to

92
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,238
legal contractual regulatory obligations

93
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,760
let us broadly categorize the types of

94
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
control frameworks out there that might

95
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
be of interest to security

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,519
industry

97
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,080
there are frameworks that are

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
used at a federal level

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
these would be documents that are

100
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,200
maintained

101
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
and

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,640
distributed by government

103
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,040
and for organizations that are looking

104
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,000
to

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,519
work with certain

106
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,599
sectors within the government they may

107
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
be finding themselves having to meet

108
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,840
these

109
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,720
frameworks um

110
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,840
requirements in order to continue to

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
operations

112
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,599
so one example would be

113
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,319
cyber essentials over in the uk

114
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,640
another example of a control framework

115
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,959
that has a federal basis will be the

116
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,360
cmmc over in the states

117
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
which is short for the cyber security

118
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
maturity model certification that one is

119
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,040
more relevant for contractors who seek

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,280
to work with the department of defense

121
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,399
another broad category here would be

122
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,120
industry based control frameworks

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,720
this would be

124
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,080
documents that are

125
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,759
meant to with a

126
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,960
keen focus on a certain industry such as

127
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,600
finance or healthcare

128
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
here's one example being the pci dss

129
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
which is short for the payment card

130
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
industry data security standard that one

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,199
is focused on

132
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,240
how

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,160
credit card information is handled

134
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,520
within an organization and processed

135
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,759
another example of an industry based

136
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,240
framework would be the high trust csf

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
which is short for the health

138
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
information trust lines common security

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,120
framework and is meant for

140
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
organizations that deals with health

141
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,000
care data

142
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,960
another category would be frameworks

143
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,360
that have a contractual obligation

144
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
these are frameworks that might not

145
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,520
necessarily apply at a federal

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,840
or industry level but they're simply

147
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,800
frameworks that an organization can

148
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,320
adopt and get certified with to show

149
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,479
that they are

150
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,120
have meet a certain baseline and to give

151
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
a form of assurance to other companies

152
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,320
that

153
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,479
are looking to work with them and

154
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,960
entrust them with their data

155
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,320
so this would be

156
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,400
two examples will be the iso

157
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,960
2701 framework which is a document

158
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,479
that is maintained by international

159
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,720
organization for standardization

160
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,639
with that is

161
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,479
that has a collection of information

162
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,120
security management standards

163
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
another example would be

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,080
the sock 2 which is short for system

165
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,360
organization controls to first

166
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
and then we come to

167
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,639
the fort

168
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,639
broad category of control frameworks

169
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,280
which is those that have community bases

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,440
these are would-be frameworks that are

171
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,479
kind of

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,720
driven by community effort

173
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,759
and

174
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
to give a collection of recommended

175
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,960
actions that may not be adequately

176
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
addressed in the other three categories

177
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,759
so two example here would be desist

178
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,960
controls which is more

179
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,400
oriented towards technical

180
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,919
recommendations

181
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,759
it might be of interest to it folks

182
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
overall

183
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,600
and then we have the ccmm

184
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,560
which is short for the cloud controls

185
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,720
matrix and is maintained by cloud

186
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
security alliance

187
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,080
and if you or it took a guess you can

188
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,199
probably

189
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,520
recognize that this framework is more

190
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,039
oriented towards cloud security

191
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,960
and so while we would hope that an

192
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
organization would be proactive

193
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
in trying to implement and adopt the

194
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
framework to help secure the

195
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,479
organization

196
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,199
and in certain cases they may be driven

197
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,759
by the fact that they realize oh gosh we

198
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,680
have an incident we have to do something

199
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,919
about it and then they kind of

200
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,599
choose and adopt the framework to help

201
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,479
them

202
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,720
secure to gain a better sense of

203
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,039
security and you know regain control of

204
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,039
things

205
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,240
all right

206
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
and this is where i want to discuss how

207
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,199
control frameworks are kind of like maps

208
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,599
if they were maps from like the 17th

209
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,840
18th century

210
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
the thing the key thing to keep in mind

211
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
is that since every framework is

212
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,199
different

213
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,039
and has different objectives they all

214
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,520
kind of have a sense of what an

215
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,840
organization do to be secure

216
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,720
but they also are each different in

217
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,840
their own ways

218
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
different enough that they might not

219
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,879
cover everything

220
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,960
that an organization

221
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
needs to know

222
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,120
and the reason why it's is because each

223
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,800
organization is different

224
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
and have unique

225
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,879
security risks that they care about

226
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,240
that

227
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
a framework might not be able to meet

228
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
keep in mind security control frameworks

229
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,400
are not quite one size fits all

230
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,479
so

231
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,560
and also and a few other things how

232
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,800
control framework is like a map

233
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,440
from 17th and 18th century

234
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,839
it won't help decide for you where to go

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,120
that is simply something that the

236
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,958
organization has to decide for

237
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,159
themselves

238
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,679
it won't tell you how risky your journey

239
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,640
will be or how much is the acceptable

240
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,480
amount of risk for

241
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,920
the organization

242
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
those are questions that has to be

243
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,279
answered in conversation between the

244
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,240
security department along with

245
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,160
board members in the organization and

246
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,000
those who

247
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,959
are at a c suite level

248
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,440
and of course these maps won't have all

249
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
the information that an organization

250
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,880
will need

251
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,519
there will be gaps

252
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,839
and

253
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,399
so how can we go about identifying these

254
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,519
gaps

255
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,560
well

256
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
here are three broad recommendations

257
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
one is first

258
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
help an organization catalog to security

259
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,719
risks that are relevant

260
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,640
second would be to help

261
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
organization review and monitor

262
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
what controls are implemented

263
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,000
for and how to implement it to see if

264
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
there are

265
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,320
if they are implemented correctly

266
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,920
or if there's something that has to be

267
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
fixed

268
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,040
and lastly

269
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,320
you should try to understand the

270
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
relationship and dependencies between

271
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,519
your controls

272
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,160
because for an organization that does

273
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,440
not adequately recognize the security

274
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
risk that they care about

275
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,519
or that is not checking the controls for

276
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,440
incorrect implementation

277
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,000
or that perhaps doesn't doesn't have a

278
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,680
good

279
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,279
understanding of how these controls

280
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,760
relate they may find themselves having

281
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,600
gaps within a security program overall

282
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,200
okay

283
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
let's try to

284
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,079
address the first recommendation

285
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,680
security risks

286
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,720
so

287
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
just to be clear

288
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
since risk is one of those words that

289
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,880
are kind of used in

290
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
security industry

291
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,440
in a lot of scenarios it's kind of best

292
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,320
to try to define what i mean by first

293
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,240
because otherwise we get sentences like

294
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
that is a high level of risk for that

295
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,800
risk

296
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,959
where it kind of becomes confusing what

297
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,279
is meant by risk in the first place

298
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,279
so when i say risk i'm not referring to

299
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,040
it as a probability

300
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,120
i'm simply referring to risk as an

301
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
uncertain event that can affect an

302
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,440
organization's ability to achieve their

303
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,560
objectives

304
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,880
so this would be something like um

305
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,680
like a data breach

306
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,640
or

307
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,320
something like

308
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,200
a

309
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
maybe the destruction of

310
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,079
data on a

311
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,839
asset or ransomware you know what are

312
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,800
the

313
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,399
events that the organization

314
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,279
are

315
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,320
is um concerned about

316
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
and keep in mind that every organization

317
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,200
runs on a certain level of risk because

318
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,920
you know that is they taken off they're

319
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,839
taking opportunity to invest

320
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
time and resources to achieve something

321
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,040
that is uncertain

322
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,320
so

323
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,480
for every organization they have

324
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
a different

325
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
appetite when it comes to risk about how

326
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,519
much

327
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,600
they're willing to uncertainty they're

328
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,440
willing to accept

329
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,959
and of course when it comes to risk

330
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,959
there are four primary ways to deal with

331
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,600
it

332
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
you can either accept the risk you can

333
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
try to remove the risk you can try to

334
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,600
mitigate the risk

335
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,519
or you can try to transfer it

336
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,519
in a case of mitigate

337
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,600
it would be something like

338
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,720
perhaps

339
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,680
you implement policy for encrypting data

340
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,959
at rest so in the case that if

341
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,800
data was stolen

342
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,079
it is harder for intact access simply

343
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,560
because it is encrypted data

344
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,480
in a case a transfer most of the time

345
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,079
that would be

346
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,040
you that would be related to

347
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,959
security insurance just

348
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,519
things that help transfer risk off to a

349
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,160
third party

350
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,839
okay

351
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,360
now let's talk about identifying

352
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,160
security risks

353
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
in this industry you will hear about a

354
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
model known as the cia triad which deals

355
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,839
with confidentiality integrity

356
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,360
availability

357
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,839
of certain assets

358
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,040
so

359
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,800
but one key thing

360
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
here that might be missing from a

361
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
conversation that might drive better

362
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,320
um discussions about security risk is

363
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,839
first talking about

364
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,959
the value

365
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,600
think thinking about what is valuable to

366
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
organization how do we create that value

367
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
in the first place

368
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
and so

369
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,279
by bringing in the idea of value and the

370
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,200
process used for value we can start

371
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,360
thinking about more directly what are

372
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,720
the

373
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,000
bad events that could have happened to

374
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,360
these

375
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,880
assets

376
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
and start thinking a little bit more

377
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,600
clearly about security risk

378
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,240
so things about like how can data be

379
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,600
destroyed how can facilities how can

380
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,160
people be denied access to facilities

381
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
things like

382
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,720
how can

383
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,959
certain technology if

384
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,920
not properly handled become

385
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
unusable over time things like this that

386
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,440
helps

387
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,760
the organization clearly understand what

388
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,399
security risks they might be concerned

389
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,639
about

390
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,760
okay so let's try

391
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,399
applying this kind of way of thinking

392
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,480
towards risk when we're trying to select

393
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,000
controls

394
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,079
here in a box is an example list from

395
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,399
iso 27002

396
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,920
the most recent one actually from this

397
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,440
year

398
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,079
and 48 controls under people categories

399
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,680
if you were to go and simply try to

400
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
implement them without thinking about

401
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,760
the risk you may not be as effective as

402
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,639
you were if you had the risk in mind

403
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,880
that the organization cares about and

404
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,959
then you can tailor these controls to

405
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,000
best

406
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,560
um suit and address these type of risk

407
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,800
so let's say if we talk about

408
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,480
the risk of when it comes to dealing

409
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,800
with people perhaps maybe the company is

410
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,639
concerned about

411
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,399
limiting the amount of workplace

412
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,880
violence prevent so trying to prevent

413
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,440
co-workers from harming another employee

414
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
or perhaps they are

415
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
concerned about whether about insider

416
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,079
threats how to detect whether somebody

417
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,279
is trying to

418
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,560
steal

419
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,440
propriety information and perhaps

420
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,920
sell it to a competitor

421
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,399
so by having the risk

422
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,959
first in mind you can help that helps

423
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,040
you better understand

424
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,000
what the controls might be helping to

425
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,399
achieve

426
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,720
so

427
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,040
next let's talk about proper control

428
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,680
implementation what does it look like

429
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,839
well for one policy

430
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,800
because without policy

431
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
certain controls might not be

432
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
implemented at all

433
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,720
policy helps the organization understand

434
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
what exactly is it trying to achieve

435
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,399
and try you know set a certain baseline

436
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,000
of an appropriate level security for

437
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
them

438
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,320
an ideal policy should you know address

439
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,839
what type of risk is in it is this for

440
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,240
the assets that this control and policy

441
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,839
applies to

442
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,800
the owner asking who is accountable for

443
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,279
the implementation of this control

444
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,440
and then of course the custodian which

445
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,199
is simply referring to who is

446
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,040
responsible for monitoring and

447
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,079
maintaining this control

448
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,240
and then when it comes to

449
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,639
documenting what is done it is important

450
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,959
to record it it's because

451
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,959
for people who

452
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,720
are new or new and brought onto the

453
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,880
organization can recognize what has been

454
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,079
the process

455
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,680
and keep

456
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,720
building upon that process

457
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,360
and it's also important for simply okay

458
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,639
so if you recognize something goes wrong

459
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,639
you can go back to documentation and

460
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,040
update

461
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,680
so ideally control documentation should

462
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,720
have an objective statement simply that

463
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,639
quickly summarizes what the control is

464
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,240
or what i will achieve

465
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,759
and then maybe a few notes about

466
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,720
dependencies does this control

467
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,680
it depend or it works in tandem with

468
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,440
another controller

469
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,720
and this will become a little bit

470
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,519
important later on where we talk about

471
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,039
the and on ontology that can be used to

472
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,959
categorize frameworks

473
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,319
or categorize controls within the

474
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,799
frameworks

475
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,439
let's start talking about that ontology

476
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,720
so

477
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,799
there's a group called the fair

478
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,199
institute that has a

479
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,039
certain

480
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,079
um

481
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
ontology that helps with

482
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,520
categorizing

483
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,760
broadly how controls are

484
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,080
and there's three main levels

485
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,280
at a high

486
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,640
um overview of how where controls fall

487
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,520
into

488
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,080
this would be controls an acid level

489
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
controls at variance level and controls

490
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,720
at a decision-making level

491
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,799
for acid level that's simply something

492
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,960
as simple as like applying a firewall to

493
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,039
an asset these are the controls that can

494
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,200
be applied directly to an asset

495
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,640
for something like variance level

496
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,600
controls that would be the two key

497
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
ones there would be policy and security

498
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
awareness training controls that help

499
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,799
the organization

500
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,039
limit too much deviation from an

501
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,640
appropriate level of security for them

502
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,080
and then when it comes to the decision

503
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,320
making level this is

504
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,520
more

505
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,480
about making sure that company is able

506
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,440
to make

507
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
informed decisions

508
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,760
about security risk management

509
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,280
and do it repeatedly

510
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,840
okay so when it comes to acid level

511
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,039
there are

512
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,160
two

513
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,000
broad categories for this you have

514
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,160
controls that prevent loss events and

515
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,440
you have controls that detect and

516
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,280
respond to loss events

517
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,039
so an example is trying to prevent a

518
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,160
loss event would be something if you

519
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,200
have like a web application or firewall

520
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,320
for short

521
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,799
that tries to monitor for malicious

522
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,960
traffic that comes to a web server and

523
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,160
drop that

524
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,559
those type of traffic

525
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,400
but then what happens if something gets

526
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,799
passed well you want ideally you want

527
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,280
control to help you detect and respond

528
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,799
to

529
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,200
if it's some if let's say someone was

530
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,240
able to

531
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,360
try to

532
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,200
trigger and

533
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
vulnerability within one of your web

534
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,559
servers

535
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,160
so

536
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,440
it's key here to know that you need

537
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,000
have a combination of those

538
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,720
of those control categories if you don't

539
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,559
have a control that helps prevent a loss

540
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,120
event and only detect and respond you

541
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,880
might be

542
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
you might be you know overloading your

543
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,480
security department with

544
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,320
work if they're not if since without

545
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,679
that percentage

546
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,520
preventive control

547
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,799
and on the flip side if you have

548
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,320
controls that prevent

549
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
and but don't have adequate controls to

550
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,799
detect and respond to loss events

551
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,679
then you are simply relying that hope on

552
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,520
the hope that nothing gets past that

553
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,240
first control

554
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,679
now let's talk about controls at a

555
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,280
variance level

556
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,520
this also is broadly defined into two

557
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,600
categories controls that prevent too

558
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
much deviation security levels and

559
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
controls that detect and respond to

560
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,120
conditions that permit significant

561
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,559
deviation

562
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,480
and prevention we already discussed

563
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,559
about this policy and security awareness

564
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,640
training are key here making sure that

565
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,200
people understand what is expected and

566
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,960
making sure that they understand how it

567
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,200
can be done

568
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,799
and then when it comes to detection

569
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,840
response

570
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,080
this can be done in a couple of forms

571
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,480
such as something like audits

572
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,280
or it can be done someplace sometimes

573
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,559
with something like

574
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,960
having well-informed people who can

575
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,559
detect

576
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,679
um when

577
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,360
the

578
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,280
conditions around the organization has

579
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,320
changed and requires you know

580
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
changing the level of appropriate level

581
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,720
security and sometimes it can be not

582
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,240
just condition inside your organization

583
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,600
but sometimes affected by conditions

584
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,159
outside like for let's say an example of

585
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,520
log4j

586
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,000
that that was an

587
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,159
event that many organizations realize

588
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,600
okay

589
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,559
we are we are likely have deviated from

590
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,840
our appropriate level of security

591
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
because now we recognize that there is

592
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,320
this vulnerability that probably affects

593
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,840
us within an organization and we have to

594
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,240
do our best to regain sense of control

595
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,120
and

596
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,399
and you know address that

597
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,559
and finally you have controls at

598
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,400
decision making level

599
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,120
so this would be things and here the

600
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,679
three components are key you need to

601
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,760
make sure that the appropriate people

602
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,039
are unable to make informed decisions

603
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,039
based on repealable processes and

604
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,200
reliable information

605
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,120
you need to make sure that you have the

606
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,520
the ability to detect when poorly made

607
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,880
decisions

608
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,520
about regarding security risks are made

609
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,400
and

610
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
that this could be simply meaning that

611
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,080
you have

612
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,720
people informed on who to

613
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,320
notify and who to get involved if this

614
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,240
these cases occur

615
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,480
and most importantly you have to have an

616
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,840
organization that's willing to learn

617
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,240
from these mistakes and respond to them

618
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,320
and document lessons learned so to

619
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,720
prevent these kind of mistakes from

620
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,000
happening in the future

621
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,679
okay in short

622
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,679
your control framework will not cover

623
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,000
everything your organization needs

624
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
there may be gaps in your security

625
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,360
program as a result

626
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,760
and to help you find those caps it helps

627
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,480
by trying to first understand the risks

628
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,280
that the organization cares about

629
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,440
continuously checking and verifying

630
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,960
controls

631
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,520
and lastly recognizing how your controls

632
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,720
relate and affect each other

633
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,640
if you want examples of

634
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
controls that perhaps might not be

635
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,480
included in one or several frameworks

636
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,559
you have i would recommend checking out

637
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,799
these free resources

638
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,679
that

639
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,760
are mainly compendiums and controls from

640
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,840
several frameworks by doing so you can

641
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,640
probably get a better coverage of what

642
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,080
your organization

643
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,840
might not be addressing already

644
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,200
that's all for i have for today

645
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
i hope you have a wonderful time with

646
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,120
the rest of digital overdose

647
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,880
and i hope you all have

648
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
smooth sailing in your security careers

649
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,400
to come thank you very much
