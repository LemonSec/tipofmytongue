1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,520
all right thank you

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,720
welcome uh this talk is from novice to

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,760
noticed

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,599
a malware analyst observations from

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,080
being nobody to becoming somebody in

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,079
this talk i am focusing on the career of

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,480
a malware analyst that is how one can

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,760
become begin doing malware analysis

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,600
and start a career in the field these

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
principles will be applicable to other

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,359
parts of information security but this

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,039
will largely focus on the role of a

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,840
malware analyst

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,719
in this talk i will introduce myself

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
why i'm talking on this subject

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,280
uh

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
let me make sure this is not in the way

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,399
uh

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
we'll discuss how to get started malware

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,879
analysis how to create content that is

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,879
meaningful and has impact

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,879
how to grow an audience to improve your

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,280
analysis and to build a career

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,800
and then we'll come back around for some

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,760
takeaways name is squiggly dude i'm a

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,280
career changer

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,680
my bachelor's specifically focused on

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,600
linguistic anthropology

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,840
that is understanding how societies use

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,439
languages

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,080
cultural anthropology the practices

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
objects and behaviors belonging to

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,439
cultures

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,960
and ethno arts

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,720
form and function of artistic

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,280
expressions within cultures

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,799
in my mind this provides me with an

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,880
advantage i'm able to come at malware

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,720
analysis with a mindset that's not

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
common to others in the industry

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,439
my approach in our analysis is largely a

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,439
humanitarian focus

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,759
i primarily do malware analysis as a

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,920
part of protecting victims and breaking

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
stuff that belong to bad guys

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,320
in my current role i function as a sock

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,600
analyst

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
in this role i'm a part of a team that

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
triage security incidents

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,600
we have a strong incident response type

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,520
approach where we try to get a clear

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,040
understanding of the full incident

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
the majority of my malware work is done

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,520
as a hobby malware analyst i maintain a

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,479
blog scribblydew.blog

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,240
originally for my blog i started with

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
analysis on the well-known malware

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,639
repository the zoo

59
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,480
however what i am known for is my

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,640
analysis on the solar marker malware

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
i'll give a short introduction to solar

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,560
marker as i'll talk a little bit more

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,480
about it later

64
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,319
here's an image of a fake google drive

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,840
you might see this if you come across

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
the malware

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
the threat actuator behind solar marker

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
uses a technique called search engine

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
optimization poisoning or seo poisoning

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,280
in order to trick search engines from

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,640
to present

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,519
results that lead to the malware

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,840
the actor's seo poisoning has been

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,440
extremely wide

75
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
unlike other malware there is no clear

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
target in an industry

77
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
the solar marker landing page may turn

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
up in search results that are looking

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,720
for anything from cyber security

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,760
policies to dragon quest to foo fighter

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
concert schedules

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
the initial payload installs a back door

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
which itself can also load an

84
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,800
infrastealer into memory

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,519
the backlog back door functions mostly

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,000
filelessly and the other modules of the

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,480
malware are also only ever loaded into

88
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
memory

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
now that you know a little bit about me

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
and a little about solar marker let's

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,720
get into the topic

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
as we begin this discussion let's define

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,480
a few terms

94
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,080
what is malware

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
well first of all malware is malicious

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,519
software

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,000
to quote the book practical malware

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
analysis malware is a software that does

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
something that causes harm to a user

100
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,680
computer or network this includes

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,040
viruses trojan horses worms root kits

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,640
scareware and spyware

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,640
that being defined malware analysis is

104
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
the art of dissecting malware to

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,959
understand how it works to identify it

106
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,799
and how to defeat or eliminate it

107
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,000
in that definition of malware analysis

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,879
we said it included dissecting malware

109
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,760
to understand how it works uh but let's

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,120
clarify one thing malware analysis is

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,759
not reverse engineering

112
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,238
reverse engineering can be used in our

113
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,400
analysis but malware analysis and

114
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,320
reverse engineering are really two

115
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,160
different fields

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,560
i bring this up to be explicit that

117
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
lack of knowledge and experience in

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
reverse engineering is not a barrier to

119
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,800
malware analysis

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,120
that being said reverse engineering can

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,520
play a role in malware analysis

122
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,120
but it's not essential

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
malware analysis is often critical in

124
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,680
incident response

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
as part of the blue team malware

126
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
analysis can be important to understand

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
what has happened when malware or

128
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,840
suspicious activity has been

129
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,360
identified the malware analyst allows

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,680
the team to quickly understand the risks

131
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,840
and the malware analyst may only need to

132
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
identify key indicators

133
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
of the malware in order to identify what

134
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,440
it is

135
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,840
malware analysis will look different in

136
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,000
different organizations but as you are

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,680
starting out the most important thing

138
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
you need to be able to do is identify

139
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,560
key indicators to identify the malware

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,600
when i talk to people wanting to start

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
out in malware analysis it reminds me of

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
my day studying linguistics

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
young people i spoke to were often

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,520
interested in the role of language

145
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,120
survey

146
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,080
the idea ideal language survey role was

147
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,880
this working in new guinea

148
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,240
in case you're not familiar with new

149
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
guinea here's a world map and a closer

150
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,360
map new guinea is north of australia in

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,160
the pacific ocean

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,479
in language survey your job would

153
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,320
include hiking across

154
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,240
mountains of new guinea

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,160
across a train that resembles an egg

156
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,360
carton

157
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
with deep valleys and high mountains as

158
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
far as you can see

159
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
with the only feasible travel being by

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,680
foot or through narrow waterways

161
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,520
in this you'll meet people and

162
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,000
communities very different from your own

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
you would learn about their language and

164
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
identify how their language and society

165
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,680
differ from their neighbors

166
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
their neighbors who have been separated

167
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,319
by mountains for generations

168
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,560
in this role you would go places and see

169
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
things that few outsiders had ever seen

170
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
i find that new malware analysts often

171
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
have these same desires to graph it

172
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,560
through new binaries that few have ever

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,759
seen

174
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,160
but these situations are unrealistic for

175
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
both the aspiring language survey

176
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,639
linguist and for the malware analyst

177
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,960
for the linguist the world isn't the

178
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,599
same as it was 80 70 or 20 years ago

179
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,360
many of these communities in new guinea

180
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
have connections now to the larger world

181
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,080
many of these same communities have

182
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
professionals who have documented their

183
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,360
own languages

184
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,880
and honestly

185
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
in these communities these people are

186
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,198
not very much unlike the rest of us

187
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,680
in linguistics and anthropology we often

188
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,280
really need more understanding of the

189
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,039
languages and the communities where we

190
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,720
already are

191
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
it is the same way with the malware

192
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,280
analysts

193
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
we need to understand the malware that

194
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,120
are threats to our businesses and to our

195
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
users

196
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,639
so likewise

197
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,800
new malware analysts should not long for

198
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,199
the exotic

199
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,039
this is the trap i often see and the

200
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,960
infosec community at large can fall for

201
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,840
this

202
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,759
we saw this in the recent cyber attacks

203
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,560
against ukraine

204
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,720
the industry

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,199
including new analysts get swept up

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,680
wanting to see and to analyze the exotic

207
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,400
as a new malwa analyst don't start with

208
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,879
the exotic

209
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,800
this malware will be researched by

210
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,039
skilled analysts

211
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,199
and if you even have findings they'll be

212
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
lost in a sea of other research

213
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,319
so where should you start

214
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,039
first of all learn the basics

215
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,440
you need to learn how to handle malware

216
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,800
safely

217
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
learn to use basic tools there are many

218
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,440
tools concepts methodologies which are

219
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,080
timeless that a malware analyst needs to

220
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,319
understand

221
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,639
and my favorite suggestion right now is

222
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,360
for

223
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,280
malware analysts is the course by husky

224
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,159
hex

225
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,640
is named pmat or practical malware

226
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,479
analysis and triage

227
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,320
the course can be accessed through tcm

228
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,120
securities academy the course provides

229
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,479
you with guidance that you need to set

230
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,560
up a secure detonation environment and

231
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,320
learn to work with many types of malware

232
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,880
so as you're starting out with

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,200
malware i suggest you start with current

234
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,640
threats

235
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
this may be malware that you've

236
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,279
identified during incident response

237
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,120
or this may be malware that you've come

238
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,080
across in the wild

239
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,480
also consider twitter there's many users

240
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,240
on twitter who share malware that

241
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,080
they've found but they themselves don't

242
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,120
investigate it or document it in depth

243
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,720
consider looking at some of the stuff

244
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,800
that they share and possibly asking them

245
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
for more details to find out how they

246
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
found the samples

247
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,120
consider posts from james in the box

248
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,959
ffff forward

249
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,079
or malware on your team

250
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,320
as a new analyst be wary of malware

251
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
repositories

252
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
malware repositories have an important

253
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,480
place in my heart and in the industry

254
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
however they are not good places for

255
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
starting malware analysts

256
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,880
the reason i say this is because malware

257
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
and malware repositories are

258
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,399
malware without context

259
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,399
an incident response setting

260
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,920
you are observing the malware in the

261
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,959
wild

262
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,640
the user found the malware from a

263
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,800
specific location and met the conditions

264
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
for the malware execution

265
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,880
in incident response you can get an

266
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
understanding of who the malware was

267
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,959
targeting how it is distributed and

268
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,800
possibly its goals

269
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
however with malware repositories you do

270
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,079
not get that context

271
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
earlier i mentioned doing reposit

272
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,600
research on the repository of the zoo

273
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,959
and i believe it's a good example of

274
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,320
what i mean

275
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
i have likened the zoo before to a bug

276
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
pin board

277
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
a bug pin board is like what you see

278
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,279
here

279
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,440
where people capture butterflies or

280
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,079
other insects and preserve their bodies

281
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,399
and pin them to a board

282
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,680
when looking at the board what

283
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,959
information can you get about the

284
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
butterflies

285
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
you can observe them to get some idea of

286
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
their anatomy

287
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,920
you can make observations about their

288
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,640
possible relations to another but

289
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
there's so much that you don't learn

290
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
where did these come from

291
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,880
when were they alive

292
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,120
did each butterfly always look like this

293
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
that is were there earlier stages to the

294
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
butterflies

295
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
were there earlier stages similar how

296
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,880
did they differ

297
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
were there even more advanced stages of

298
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
these butterflies

299
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,160
are any of these extinct

300
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
some of this lack of context can be

301
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
resolved with metadata perhaps you can

302
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,079
find a book that matches the color of

303
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,320
the butterfly to a name you can match it

304
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,079
to a location and match it to a time

305
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,240
the zoo malware repository and other

306
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,600
repositories are like this

307
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,720
again

308
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,560
consider a repository like malware

309
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,680
bazaar

310
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
if we look at my uploads of solar marker

311
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,279
what do we learn

312
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,760
well we see zip files and dlls in the

313
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,519
type column

314
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,000
we see a series of different names like

315
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,480
jupiter whole dessert solar marker

316
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
yellow cockatoo but what are the

317
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,560
relations between these

318
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,959
when was the malware active

319
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,800
the dates in the repository just tell us

320
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
when it was uploaded not when the

321
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
malware was active

322
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
we don't learn the answers to these

323
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,880
questions through the repository

324
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
and often the samples themselves are

325
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
unable to tell us

326
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,959
like the butterflies we actually can

327
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,120
learn a lot more by watching them and

328
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,320
finding them in their natural

329
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,959
environments

330
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
that way if there are multiple stages

331
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,880
if there's particular artifacts

332
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,200
and if an investigation is done into the

333
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
origin of the malware it can

334
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
significantly enhance your understanding

335
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,519
of the malware

336
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,040
this leads us into creating content

337
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,320
so when you begin to create content

338
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,920
what should you write about

339
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,680
well

340
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,600
write about malware that is an active

341
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,720
threat

342
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,600
that is

343
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,440
to create meaningful content and create

344
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,279
content that people want to read you

345
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,120
should write about malware

346
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,800
there are threats to companies and

347
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,959
individuals today these are malwares

348
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,720
that people come to your blog to read

349
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,240
about

350
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,519
write about the context of the malware

351
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,200
how is the malware distributed

352
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,959
what is its life cycle does it have

353
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,120
multiple stages is it just one stage

354
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,839
what does it do

355
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,399
i've talked about this in the abstract

356
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,040
but let's be a little bit more practical

357
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,480
i want to talk about this in a way that

358
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,560
you can see yourself doing this

359
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,240
let's talk about an incident response

360
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,399
situation you've heard about or you've

361
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,959
seen an active malware threat

362
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,279
what is it you can learn about the

363
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,639
threat so far

364
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,880
was it detected by automation

365
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,440
was that how you learned about it

366
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,040
from the signal or the indicators that

367
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,959
you've seen can you identify the family

368
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,639
can you use those indicators to find

369
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,079
publications about the malware

370
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,480
can you match what you've found with

371
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,120
what is published

372
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,480
when you write about malware these are

373
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,560
the types of holes you want to cover

374
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,079
if automation fails to match the

375
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,160
detected scripts or detected binaries of

376
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,000
the malware family people need a way to

377
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
discover it for themselves this is where

378
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,120
your writing can come into play

379
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,959
this is the type of malware behavior

380
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,720
that gives you the opportunity to fill

381
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,639
that need you publish content that

382
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,880
others can find when investigating the

383
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,839
malware

384
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,959
execution you read articles about

385
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,560
malware the majority of the articles are

386
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
written for malware analysts

387
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,839
and it is written for those who are

388
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,160
already familiar with the malware

389
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,440
so if you want to create meaningful

390
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,279
content don't just write from our

391
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,199
analysts but also write so that others

392
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
can find

393
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,519
your content when investigating an

394
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,199
incident

395
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,560
so you can pivot from these other

396
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
questions

397
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,279
so

398
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,760
we can ask

399
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,480
what indicators do analysts or victims

400
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,680
find

401
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
i personally try to include scripts and

402
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,279
clear text so that people can search for

403
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,040
recognizable patterns and find my

404
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
content

405
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,959
what helped you identify it as a malware

406
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,638
family or were you able to do so

407
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,320
is there anything recent published about

408
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,560
the malware do publications talk about

409
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
the malware where it comes from or how

410
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,880
victims are exposed to it

411
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,720
i often find malware hasn't been

412
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,560
published about for years

413
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,480
or the only details i can find are short

414
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
twitter posts

415
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,639
the behavior that you've detected does

416
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,959
it match what has already been published

417
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,600
has it changed since that time

418
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,519
these are areas where your writing in

419
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,600
fill gaps

420
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,199
if i want to write about a malware i

421
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,199
also try to read up as much as possible

422
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,040
about it to get an understanding of how

423
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
it's changed and what others have seen

424
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,120
this helps me understand

425
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
what areas i can cover in my own writing

426
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
to better understand

427
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,360
what i've seen in the malware and also

428
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,120
share new details with others

429
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,440
you are also able to confirm and enhance

430
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,920
your own analysis skills possibly learn

431
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,519
how to analyze parts of the malware

432
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,040
where you struggle to understand it

433
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,519
suppose you followed my advice and you

434
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,120
found and you wrote about a malware that

435
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,040
you identified great

436
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,680
what comes after that

437
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,199
well why not write about the malware

438
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,639
again

439
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,320
it can be tempting to say i finished

440
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
that now i can move on

441
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,000
but in reality there are likely

442
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,560
questions you haven't answered

443
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
how does the distribution work

444
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,320
do they try to prevent researchers from

445
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
downloading payloads

446
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,199
can that security measure be broken

447
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,000
how does it work

448
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,079
if you download another payload how does

449
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,120
it change

450
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,399
is it the same

451
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,440
what about a week from now

452
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,360
how does it differ from past payloads

453
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,320
can we anticipate how it will change

454
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,839
can we enhance our detections

455
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,279
what happens if it's left unmitigated

456
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,399
and no security software stops it

457
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
the reason we might want to research to

458
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,680
answer these questions is because these

459
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,399
questions often get left unanswered

460
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,079
but these are still important questions

461
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,480
regarding the life of the malware

462
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,839
being able to study answer

463
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,280
questions like these will greatly

464
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
enhance enhance the value of your

465
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,000
documentation

466
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,400
this brings us to a way that you can use

467
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
malware repositories

468
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,559
if you continue to study the same hour

469
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,480
how does it compare to malware samples

470
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,839
that you have uploaded that other

471
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,599
researchers have uploaded

472
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,199
that is now that you've studied the

473
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,559
malware take what you've learned and

474
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,640
apply it to more samples

475
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,039
you noticed indicators of compromise or

476
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,520
ioc are they consistent across samples

477
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,080
if you wrote a yara rule does the yar

478
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,559
rule consistently apply to other samples

479
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,080
of the malware

480
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,240
in addition to previously seen malware

481
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,880
does your yar rule match new samples of

482
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,960
the malware or is it already outdated

483
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,640
can you learn anything about the actors

484
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
habits

485
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,960
this is an example of an analysis i

486
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
completed solar marker updates weekly

487
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
i created a script to analyze the

488
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,919
hard-coded ip addresses found in solar

489
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,440
marker binaries

490
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,280
doing a larger analysis revealed that

491
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,160
the ip addresses used by the actor are

492
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,320
regularly to be associated with the same

493
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,320
asn or autonomous system number

494
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,919
and here we saw that they preferred

495
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,559
as9009

496
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,200
m247

497
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
and this was helpful in indicating

498
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,919
identifying future ips that they used or

499
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,039
matching

500
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,240
other activity that they did

501
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,919
so if you keep starting the same malware

502
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,080
what can you learn

503
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
when you are creating content keep

504
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
asking what more you can learn about the

505
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,240
life cycle of the malware

506
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
the work of the malware author and

507
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,960
publish your findings

508
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,039
if the malware isn't trusting you

509
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,960
interesting to you keep studying

510
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
if it is not interesting perhaps look

511
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,840
for another to study

512
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
so suppose you've done this research and

513
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,600
perhaps published it on a blog how then

514
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,360
can you continue to grow your audience

515
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,160
consider your own experience in

516
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,919
identifying the malware

517
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,039
was

518
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,039
the malware already uploaded to

519
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,120
virustotal

520
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,840
if it wasn't consider uploading it

521
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,280
and consider leaving a comment

522
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,880
whenever i download solar marker

523
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
i uploaded virus total and i leave a

524
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
comment my comment explains what the

525
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,240
malware is gives the backdoor c2 ip

526
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,799
address and provides references

527
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,400
this allows people who receive the same

528
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,640
malware to understand what it is even if

529
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
the detection is low

530
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,080
they are able to then follow my

531
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,919
references and see that it matches their

532
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,600
experience

533
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,440
how does this help grow your audience

534
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,280
well for one people notice these

535
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,799
comments and people will follow the

536
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,160
references to learn more about the

537
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,480
malware and if it wasn't especially if

538
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,960
it was in their environment

539
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,720
these types of comments don't take much

540
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,799
time but allows incident responders to

541
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,760
find your content

542
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,640
if you upload to malware bazaar you can

543
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
also get additional feedback about how

544
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,880
your sharing benefits the community

545
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,200
malware bazaar shows how many times your

546
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,360
sample has been downloaded by automated

547
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,799
systems and other researchers

548
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,640
uploading it there also makes it easily

549
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,840
available to the community

550
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
what about other methods

551
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
uh i highly recommend using twitter to

552
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,280
share important ideas about in details

553
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,520
about the malware

554
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,799
twitter is important to the

555
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,799
cybersecurity professionals right now

556
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,320
it's a great place to find more

557
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,840
information about malware in your

558
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,600
environment and find up-to-date

559
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,039
indicators

560
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,039
so if you identify domains use them by

561
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,039
the malware unique tactics these are

562
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,880
great things to share

563
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,480
both other researchers and incident

564
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
responders look to twitter to match

565
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,159
indicators of compromise to malware

566
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,440
families

567
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,200
this goal of sharing is both to help

568
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,799
other researchers companies and yourself

569
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,320
allows you to publish your work and make

570
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,600
yourself known in the industry

571
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,159
also use twitter to connect with others

572
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,679
if you do additional research i

573
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,440
mentioned earlier you might find unique

574
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,240
details other researchers don't have

575
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,600
i will personally reach out to other

576
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,039
researchers who have published about the

577
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,280
same malware i find that the majority of

578
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,760
them stay interested in the malware

579
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,720
and they're happy to talk more about it

580
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,679
in that regard also share freely

581
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,280
if i find information that i can't

582
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
publish publicly

583
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,840
i often share this with other

584
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,120
organizations so as we talk about the

585
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,159
idea of disrupting bad actors it also op

586
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,559
that takes cooperation between multiple

587
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,240
organizations

588
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
and by sharing with others you can get

589
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,559
involved in that process

590
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,880
but when you reach out to others

591
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
uh you should be respectful and don't be

592
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,760
shy to reach out other people are often

593
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,240
happy to listen and happy to share

594
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,159
so in the talk

595
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,240
i introduced myself i mentioned some of

596
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,799
my motivations and malware analysis and

597
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
though i didn't talk about it in depth i

598
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,480
really recommend considering your own

599
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,080
motivations like

600
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,919
are you doing it for others are you

601
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,600
doing it because you enjoy the technical

602
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,559
side

603
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
it's a good thing to understand your

604
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,240
motivations and see how they can how you

605
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,280
can use them to your advantage

606
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,200
i then talked about getting started in

607
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,240
malware analysis learning the basics and

608
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,880
avoiding exotic malware i encourage you

609
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,480
to find malware that still has its

610
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,679
context

611
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,679
and working to understand how it lives

612
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,640
and behaves in the wild

613
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,559
i gave guidance on creating content

614
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,480
focusing on active threats and

615
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,039
understanding the context of the malware

616
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,960
i encouraged including details to help

617
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
others identify the malware that you

618
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,640
wrote about studying and writing about

619
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,520
the malware multiple times

620
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,080
i went to talk went to talk about

621
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,760
growing your audience

622
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,840
taking the time to annotate samples on

623
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,760
virus total and sharing your findings

624
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,240
through blog posts twitter posts and

625
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,000
other methods

626
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
talked about reaching out to other

627
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,280
researchers being respectful and willing

628
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,039
to share

629
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,880
this concludes my talk and i wish you

630
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,960
the best and safety in your malware

631
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,280
analysis adventures

632
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,720
if you're interested in asking questions

633
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,320
or following up with my research you're

634
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,400
welcome to reach out to the means on the

635
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,679
slide

636
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,200
also thanks for coming i believe you

637
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,960
have some time for questions else you

638
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,960
can also follow up with me elsewhere

639
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,240
wow squib that was amazing um we

640
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,919
definitely have a lot of questions for

641
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,640
you

642
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,840
um if i may start with my own

643
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,640
question i just have to get to the

644
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,559
channel first god i'm so good at being

645
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,400
unprepared i should i should do a

646
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,840
conference opening i'm preparing for a

647
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,120
talk

648
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,000
um

649
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,960
all right

650
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,840
so

651
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,159
when studying malware and consistencies

652
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,840
in iocs are you able to use that

653
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,279
information to find the threat actor

654
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,159
who's developed it

655
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,600
uh

656
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,520
yes

657
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,360
yes i will put in quotes uh

658
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,240
uh sometimes it's easier with others and

659
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,480
it depends on the size of the footprint

660
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,520
that they

661
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
leave and the cooperation from other

662
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,120
organizations

663
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
for example i've documented a large

664
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,760
amount about solar marker but i have

665
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,000
some difficulty getting cooperation from

666
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
the people that probably

667
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,600
have more data

668
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,120
that makes sense

669
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,600
and then uh so leo followed up with a

670
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,760
really good follow-up question and if

671
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
the threat actor is found what process

672
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,159
follows with that

673
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,520
uh yeah

674
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,480
so for example i

675
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,760
i have some cooperation with u.s law

676
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,240
enforcement and other entities that are

677
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,960
interested in taking down actors

678
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,919
i

679
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,600
there's a long process that can work

680
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,440
through them because

681
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,840
they're equally interested as businesses

682
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,760
so it ends up being a large process

683
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,679
honestly

684
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,559
law enforcement will often want to

685
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,480
be very coordinated because as we've

686
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,039
seen in the past with botnets they can

687
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,600
be very resilient to take down we saw

688
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,360
the same thing with emote

689
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,880
that though they

690
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,279
pushed out a disinfectant

691
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,080
uh command to all the bots emote come

692
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
back and more people are supporting it

693
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,960
now

694
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,799
uh so it can be a really

695
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,960
uh rough and long process

696
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,440
but you can easily

697
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,200
well maybe not easily but you can get

698
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,039
connected with law enforcement and

699
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,360
people that are really interested and

700
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,039
have the ability to take these things

701
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
down

702
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,240
awesome nicos do you want to take the

703
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,360
next question

704
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,559
sure

705
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,600
um so what are some dangers that come

706
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,360
with malware analysis

707
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,360
are there any legal ramifications that

708
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,679
people should be aware of when becoming

709
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,200
one

710
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,480
uh

711
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,880
dangerous uh first of all i was talking

712
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,200
to someone recently and they pointed out

713
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
dangers of

714
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,880
using twitter for example

715
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,200
i'm doing active damage to someone who's

716
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
spending a lot of time to

717
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,679
infect machines

718
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,240
and that doesn't always work well with

719
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,320
some our analysts and you can receive

720
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,600
threats and other things regarding that

721
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,320
so twitter can also be unsafe in that

722
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,080
regard

723
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,039
people can abuse the systems to get

724
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,960
personal information about you even if

725
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,120
you're not publishing it

726
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,039
uh so there is risk in that regard

727
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,039
i i forget forgot the second part of the

728
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,799
question sorry

729
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,679
um that's all right

730
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,640
are there any um right

731
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,400
are there any legal ramifications that

732
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
people should be aware of when becoming

733
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,480
a malware analyst

734
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,480
i

735
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,158
i think it's sort of like uh

736
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,240
pin testing where

737
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,480
you shouldn't go places unless you have

738
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,120
authority to do so for example

739
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,039
you shouldn't try to walk into back

740
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,919
doors of infected machines or walk into

741
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,679
back doors of

742
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,400
command control servers

743
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,960
i know some people do try to do that

744
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,640
it's not something that i can endorse

745
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,840
make sense

746
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,799
uh yeah so the someone commented that

747
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,559
yeah when you when you contact law

748
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,919
enforcement it

749
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,200
takes time uh as in like politics also

750
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,520
working uh and you know you have months

751
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,159
of processes or years sometimes

752
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,440
uh is that something you've had

753
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,000
experience with

754
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,360
i

755
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,039
yeah i i've been working with someone

756
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,000
recently and passing the information and

757
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,240
uh it is sometimes

758
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,000
hard especially if you keep looking at

759
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,159
the same malware day after day or week

760
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,480
after week uh you can sometimes lose

761
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,760
perspective and think it's more

762
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,159
important than it might actually be

763
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:00,960
uh

764
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,799
but it's also important to recognize

765
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,559
there's a lot of malware out there

766
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,799
there's a lot of bad actors and these

767
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,559
government entities are dealing with a

768
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,000
lot of stuff

769
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,679
uh so

770
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,120
they're also wanting to make sure that

771
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,480
they have

772
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,279
everyone on board so they can do

773
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,679
good and efficient takedowns um that's

774
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,840
why some of these videos for example of

775
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,960
uh

776
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,840
ransomware authors being taken down

777
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,279
have been released by like russia or

778
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,840
ukraine can be entertaining but you also

779
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,960
want to make sure you've actually

780
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
brought the thing down

781
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,480
by contrast you see still still see

782
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,159
activity by clop ransomware or the emote

783
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,399
actors

784
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,279
okay

785
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,039
and i know you've been talking a lot

786
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,600
about solar marker but uh was that your

787
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,159
favorite um

788
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,559
malware or is there another one that you

789
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,320
quite appreciate

790
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
i

791
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,559
solar marker has been something that

792
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,799
i've spent a lot of time on because it

793
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,960
hadn't received much attention when i

794
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,200
first started looking at it

795
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,240
uh

796
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,480
it also updates weekly and i've been

797
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,880
able to learn as they continue to

798
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,960
enhance their

799
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,039
skills uh

800
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,159
i also

801
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,840
got their attention at some point and

802
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,520
they sent me an email

803
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,360
so it's a little bit of a cat and mouse

804
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,120
game at this point where

805
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,360
i enjoy trying to

806
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,240
suss out their stuff and expose it and

807
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,360
take it down and they enjoy the

808
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,360
competition
