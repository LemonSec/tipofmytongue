1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,200
my name is tom quinn

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,840
i live in the uk i'm in shropshire

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,599
um i've worked in it and cyber security

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,400
for around 15 years i've done various

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,080
things in that time

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,039
from

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,240
systems administration and help desk and

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,240
i've written code

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,640
networks databases i'd be easier to say

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,400
what i haven't done frankly

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,359
and

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,840
all the way up to it management

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,680
for the last few years i've been

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,040
focusing on cyber security um working in

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,719
vulnerability management

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,800
and more recently i've been in my

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,399
current job for uh five weeks as a

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,960
security manager for a large consultancy

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,879
firm

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,879
they say that i hack for fun

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,160
i love

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,039
things like hack the box and try hack me

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,600
i write code in my spare time i like

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,800
writing in python recently learnt c

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,920
um

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,760
i do capture the flag events and things

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
like that and for me it's uh it's a

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,720
hobby it's one that i enjoy

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,799
but it's also something that i think

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,040
understanding technical details

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,960
of exploits and hacks and things like

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,600
that really helps support me at work

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,080
and gives me a good background knowledge

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
i'm a certified information system

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,280
security professional

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,200
i know people have different views on

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,880
different certifications and things but

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,360
i worked hard for my sister i

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,400
really value it and i think it's a

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
really good certification

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,119
and i'm on twitter um as tom gwenet if

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,240
you would like to follow me

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,280
so why am i here

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,960
i am a big believer that risk

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,640
is the foundation

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,479
of everything we do

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,439
in information security and

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,119
everything we should be doing no matter

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,600
what area we're in we're talking about

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,280
you know from pen testing to

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
vulnerability management blue team red

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
team grc

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,680
everything should be about identifying

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,119
and addressing

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,840
risk

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,480
risk is also a concept that is very very

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,040
familiar to business

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,280
it's very familiar to management

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,599
it's very familiar to

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,200
senior

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,040
c-level executives

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
boards of businesses are all very

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,000
familiar with risk um as a as a concept

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
so when we are trying to

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,519
explain security issues to non-security

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,560
people

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,680
when we're trying to obtain budget

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
or get signed off on our on our

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
strategies it's useful to understand

70
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,239
what

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,200
c-level senior board people

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
are concerned with and they will

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
understand risk and being able to use

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,400
the correct language and frame your

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
argument in the correct way

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
will really really help and i think this

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
goes down all the way across

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,879
our industry from management down to

79
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,000
boots on the ground people if you

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,599
understand risk it's going to help you

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,720
out

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,480
it's also really useful in terms of

83
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,319
prioritization

84
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,840
so we've got loads of different things

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
we can do different controls we can put

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,360
in do we want to put in a web

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
application firewall do we want to

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
change our endpoint protection do we

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
want to do security awareness training

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,319
do we want to do these things

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,400
and what order do we do them in

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,920
what's most important what do we need to

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,840
do first

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,879
by trying to evaluate the risk

95
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,680
and

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,519
we can begin to

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,360
put things into an order and say this is

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,640
this is the most important thing we're

99
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,760
going to do that's where we're going to

100
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
focus our energy first and then we can

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,680
move on from there

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,159
and by doing that it means that you are

103
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,159
able to defend your position should

104
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,640
anything ever happen and someone um

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,120
maybe inaudible or um

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
even legal was to come and say we've had

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,200
a breach

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,519
why what what why did this get passed

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,280
why did your cyber security strategy not

110
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
address this you can say this is the

111
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
reason we did what we did we identified

112
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,599
the risk

113
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,560
so

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,920
i'm going to talk about the following

115
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,200
i'm going to go through and talk about

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
some definitions of risk i'm going to

117
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,879
talk about some types of risk i'm going

118
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,840
to touch on how we can deal with risk

119
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
but overall i'm just talking about the

120
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,519
basics this is not

121
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,279
overly complicated i'm not going to turn

122
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,400
everyone into risk management

123
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
professionals what i'm hoping to do here

124
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,720
is just give you the basics the

125
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,040
foundation

126
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
so let's talk about some definitions of

127
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
risk

128
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
i've got an isc squared definition on

129
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
the screen i'm assist i put an ic square

130
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,680
definition on the slide

131
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,759
this is a definition that i think really

132
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,560
resonates with me that risk

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,360
is

134
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,479
equals

135
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,840
likelihood

136
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,240
multiplied by impact

137
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
the level of risk can be determined by

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
how likely something is to occur and

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,840
what the impact would be if it did occur

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,759
this risk matrix you may have seen

141
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
something similar to this

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
i've seen these in loads of different

143
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,880
documents and books and things like that

144
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,680
which is a kind of a representation of

145
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,720
the size of the risk

146
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,080
by differing likelihood and impact so we

147
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,280
can say from the bottom right hand

148
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,680
corner we can say a risk that is highly

149
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,280
likely to occur

150
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,759
and has a large impact if it does occur

151
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,199
is critical

152
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,160
and conversely in the top left corner if

153
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,039
it's

154
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,120
not very likely to occur and if it did

155
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,759
occur it wouldn't have a large impact

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,560
then it's not large risk

157
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
i find this diagram a little bit dry so

158
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
on the next slide i've tried to

159
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,400
just

160
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,560
create a more visual representation of

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,320
the same concept

162
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,039
using super mario

163
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,840
so the same concept applies in this

164
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,440
diagram right in the top left we're

165
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,680
looking at a risk that is not very

166
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,639
likely to occur the gap is small mario

167
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,560
can jump over it

168
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
it's fine

169
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
if the risk does occur if mario does

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
fall down the hole

171
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
the impact is low

172
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
because he can jump out it might slow

173
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,680
him down but ultimately he can carry on

174
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,479
his day carry on playing the game

175
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,319
and the same on the top right we now see

176
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,319
that the likelihood is higher the gap is

177
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,280
larger

178
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,240
he will

179
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
much more likely to fall down that hole

180
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,560
but he can still jump out

181
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,080
moving down to the bottom of the diagram

182
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
you can see on the bottom left again the

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,160
likelihood is now low he can jump it but

184
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,720
if he does fall down here he will lose a

185
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
life he will die you will have to go

186
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,720
back to the start 11 and start again

187
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,160
and then the representation of the

188
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,039
critical risk at the bottom right is

189
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,479
it's quite highly likely he's going to

190
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,840
fall down that hole because that gap is

191
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,400
big and if he does then he loses a life

192
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,880
this is what we would a critical risk

193
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
highly likely to occur

194
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,800
and with a large impact if it does occur

195
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,240
so i spoke about risk being likelihood

196
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,199
multiplied by impact so i'd like to

197
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,880
break that down

198
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,599
a little further

199
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,919
we can break likelihood down

200
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,960
into vulnerabilities and threats

201
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,280
for a risk to occur

202
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,080
when we talk about cyber security risk

203
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,840
for is to occur has to be a

204
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,440
vulnerability to be exploited

205
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,919
the vulnerability can sit and be around

206
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,160
something like a traditional

207
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,319
i.t vulnerability

208
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,919
you know like a

209
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,520
an unpatched system or a

210
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,599
misconfiguration

211
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,280
or it can be a

212
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,759
a weakness outside of that like

213
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,280
someone clicking a phishing link or the

214
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,639
the possibility of someone clicking a

215
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,080
phishing link vulnerability

216
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,759
the threat

217
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,280
is

218
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,520
the people the threat actors

219
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
the criminals in most cases

220
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,080
who are trying to

221
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,000
exploit those vulnerabilities who are

222
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,039
trying to breach your computer systems

223
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,479
and it's important if you look at if

224
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,919
you're trying to analyze risk you can

225
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,960
look at

226
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,199
trying to work out the likelihood

227
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,879
one area of doing that one way of doing

228
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,000
that is to look and say i want to

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
understand the threat i want to try and

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,960
understand

231
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,840
who these people are

232
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
why are they doing what they're doing so

233
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,039
we can look at the threat and say we can

234
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,360
be talking about things like advanced

235
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,039
persistent threats we could be talking

236
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,879
about script kiddies

237
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,159
ransomware gangs initial access you know

238
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,599
gangs who are just trying to breach

239
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,839
systems and sell that access on

240
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,360
we can talk about

241
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,719
insider threat

242
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,120
right we talk about insider threat

243
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
we think of

244
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,240
disgruntled employees

245
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,399
but we could also think of

246
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,959
insider threat can be a mistake caused

247
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,120
by an employee right and untrained

248
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,760
employees could be considered an insider

249
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,279
through

250
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,200
and we can talk about supply chain

251
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
we can talk about

252
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,519
how

253
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,640
could

254
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,399
a threat come from one of our vendors

255
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,760
could a threat come from one of our

256
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,959
customers

257
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,080
is there a way that that could occur

258
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
and within the threat side of this

259
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
equation we're also talking about the

260
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
volume of attacks so if you're talking

261
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
about how likely is a risk to occur

262
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,480
you're talking about breaching a

263
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,800
computer system you'd be looking at the

264
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
vulnerability side of this equation and

265
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
saying how easy is it to exploit

266
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,519
how many vulnerabilities are there

267
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,800
and then you'll be looking at the threat

268
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,440
side of the equation to say well

269
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
how many people are trying to exploit

270
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,080
the vulnerability how skilled are they

271
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,839
if you're looking at lots of highly

272
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,640
skilled people trying to exploit lots of

273
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
easy to exploit vulnerabilities then the

274
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
likelihood is pretty high

275
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,440
that that's going to occur

276
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240
now as security professionals

277
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,600
when you look at this equation you may

278
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,440
have identified it already we can only

279
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,519
really control the vulnerability part of

280
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,560
this

281
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
the threat side of this equation is

282
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,839
external the threat side is happening

283
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,360
and there's very little you can do to

284
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
control that so if you would like to

285
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
reduce the likelihood of a risk

286
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,680
occurring

287
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,079
logic would say you have to focus on the

288
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,760
vulnerability path by reducing the

289
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,040
vulnerability

290
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,959
with a constant threat

291
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,000
the likelihood reduces

292
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,880
so again we're going to come back to

293
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,079
this very basic definition risk being

294
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,200
likelihood multiplied by impact

295
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
so we've touched on

296
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,120
breaking down the likelihood

297
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
so how can we break down the impact

298
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,920
you may be

299
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,200
familiar with the cia triad

300
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
this is something that is kind of quite

301
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,880
foundational within

302
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,120
itp security

303
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,839
and this is a way of looking at how

304
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,640
could we be impacted by a risk

305
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,839
being realized

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,920
so the c

307
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
in the cia triad stands for

308
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,959
confidentiality

309
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,680
we talk about confidentiality

310
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
we're talking about people having access

311
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,959
to data or information or systems that

312
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,880
they shouldn't do

313
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,279
so for confidentiality to be in place

314
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,120
the only people who can access data

315
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,279
information systems are the people who

316
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,279
are authorized to do so

317
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,920
so i can only access the information i

318
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,760
need to do my job the information that i

319
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,399
have permission to access

320
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,720
conversely my personal data in various

321
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,800
systems should only be accessible to the

322
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,640
people who need it if that isn't the

323
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,240
case there has been an impact to the

324
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,120
confidentiality

325
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,839
the i in the cia triad is

326
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,720
stands for integrity

327
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,079
integrity we're talking about

328
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,440
not allowing data to be inappropriately

329
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
changed

330
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,279
changed by someone who shouldn't change

331
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,920
it or changed in a way that it shouldn't

332
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,320
be allowed to be changed

333
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
and the fact that

334
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,600
you need you should be able to access

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
data and trust that it is in the state

336
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
that you expect it to be in that

337
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
everyone expects it to be and it hasn't

338
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
been modified somewhere with no one's

339
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
knowledge

340
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
and then the a

341
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,720
is availability

342
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,320
can everyone access the data information

343
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,480
and systems that they need to when they

344
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,240
need to do them are

345
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,800
the systems online are they available to

346
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,279
be used

347
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,639
now obviously cyber attacks cyber risk

348
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,959
can hit more than one of these

349
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,480
um if you were to look at like your

350
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,120
typical ransomware attack

351
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
you'd be saying

352
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
we probably hit confidentiality and

353
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,240
availability because

354
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,320
the ransomware is going to encrypt your

355
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,920
network it's going to take systems

356
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,600
offline they're going to be unavailable

357
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,279
to be used

358
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,880
and the way ransomware gangs tend to

359
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,560
work nowadays with a kind of double

360
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,160
extortion model

361
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,000
they will normally take your data and

362
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,639
exfiltrate it before they encrypt the

363
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,839
network and then threaten to release it

364
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,440
on the internet if you don't pay the

365
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
ransom

366
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,720
that's affected the confidentiality of

367
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,440
the data so that would hit but two sides

368
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,160
of the cia trend

369
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,639
we can also

370
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,399
talk about categorizing our impact into

371
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,279
five categories

372
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,240
so

373
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,519
a risk being realized could um affect a

374
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,440
business in in one of these five ways

375
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,920
we could affect it operationally we

376
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,079
could affect the day-to-day running of

377
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,959
the business so this is

378
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,800
an impact that would affect what the

379
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
business does

380
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,440
a transport business and you transport

381
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,199
people and goods we're talking about

382
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,959
affecting the transport of people and

383
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,959
goods your manufacturing business would

384
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,639
be talking about affecting the

385
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,399
manufacturer of products

386
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,560
and operational

387
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,079
day-to-day impact to the business

388
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,720
and also talk about strategic impact

389
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
this would be impacting the future

390
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,959
direction of the business the strategy

391
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,120
of the business what the business is

392
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,440
trying to do so whether it's trying to

393
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,000
move into a new market or develop a new

394
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,680
product or switch the way it does

395
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,639
business

396
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,959
the realization of a risk the impact

397
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,560
could be an effect on that strategic

398
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199
direction

399
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,440
it could also be a legal impact the

400
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,839
obvious legal impact is is to say well

401
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,000
you could be sued

402
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,199
and that is true

403
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,199
but within that legal category i would

404
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,399
also put in things like compliance

405
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,959
regulatory compliance so

406
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,360
things like gdpr

407
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,720
pci dss would sit within that legal

408
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,440
that legal category

409
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
as well as anything more specific if

410
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,800
you're in specific industries like

411
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
healthcare or financial services or

412
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,720
critical national infrastructure there

413
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
may be specific

414
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,519
industry

415
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,920
standards that you would need to adhere

416
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,440
to that would sit within there and again

417
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,399
you can you can see an impact

418
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,079
cyber security risk can impact that

419
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,600
you could impact third parties

420
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,760
we talked earlier briefly about there

421
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
being

422
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,399
a supply chain threat but it can also be

423
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,320
a supply chain impact

424
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,720
if a cyber security risk is realized

425
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,160
within my business

426
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,639
is there impact on

427
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,399
my suppliers

428
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,480
impact on my customers

429
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,680
is there impact on any stakeholder

430
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,519
connected to my business that is not

431
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,360
within my business they are third

432
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,440
parties that would be third-party

433
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,639
impacts that we're talking about

434
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,759
and

435
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,800
the final category financial impact

436
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,120
the easiest one to give an example of

437
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,519
measured in pounds and pence

438
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,000
dollars and cents euros and cents

439
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
wherever you are in the world

440
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,759
how much does it cost

441
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,279
how much is it going to impact our

442
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,519
bottom line if this risk is realized

443
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,240
i also want to just touch briefly on the

444
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,040
concept of secondary risk

445
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,680
would this risk being realized

446
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,959
affect

447
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,399
another risk

448
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,079
and we spoke and said risk is made up of

449
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,920
likelihood and impact

450
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,880
so

451
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,839
would the realization of this risk

452
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,120
increase

453
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,480
the likelihood

454
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,839
or the impact

455
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,920
of another risk

456
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,199
the impact could be a change in another

457
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,880
risk be a secondary risk

458
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,120
so what can we do about it

459
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
how can we deal

460
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,839
with risk

461
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
there's four ways that

462
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,440
risk can be dealt with

463
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,360
it can be avoided

464
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,679
and to avoid a risk what we are talking

465
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,880
about is

466
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,559
completely taking the possibility of

467
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,679
that risk occurring away

468
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,000
um if you're talking about like an it

469
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
system if we're talking about a server

470
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,359
or we're saying the risk is that that

471
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,160
server is going to be attacked or hacked

472
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,000
we turn it off

473
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,520
we unplug it

474
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,240
we avoid the risk entirely

475
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,799
now that may sound a little silly

476
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,120
and you'll say but you've you can't use

477
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,640
the system anymore

478
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,720
that's true

479
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,080
but it's an option and it's one that

480
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,360
should be considered and it's one that i

481
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
have seen in my experience

482
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,440
and that that's a way to address risk if

483
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,720
the risk is too high and the risk

484
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,960
is bigger than the benefit the system is

485
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,480
providing

486
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
it could be a very sensible decision to

487
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
avoid that risk entirely and just turn

488
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
it off decommission it let's take it

489
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,360
away

490
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,120
or

491
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,679
we can look to reduce the risk

492
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,799
again

493
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,679
we

494
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,000
have said that risk is made up of

495
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,440
likelihood

496
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,799
and impact

497
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,760
and that likelihood is made up of

498
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,039
vulnerability

499
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,039
and threat

500
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,799
to reduce the risk we're going to want

501
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,960
to reduce any of those

502
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,640
or all of those ideally we're going to

503
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
reduce as much of those as we can so

504
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,720
we're going to look at things like okay

505
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,840
how can i reduce the

506
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,000
likelihood i can put controls in place

507
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,960
like

508
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
i can start firewalling things off i can

509
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,320
try and put things behind vpns i can

510
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,240
make things less accessible

511
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
put in controls like multi-factor

512
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
authentication

513
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
i can do good vulnerability management

514
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,559
to try and address that vulnerability i

515
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,720
can patch my systems i can do von scans

516
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,240
so that i can see where the gaps are

517
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,400
then i can say how can i how can i

518
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,720
reduce the impact so i can look at

519
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,760
things like segmenting my network and

520
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,240
putting in good detection so that if

521
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,840
that anything happens i know about it

522
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,120
and i can shut it down nice and quickly

523
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,720
just would sit within the reduced

524
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
category of risk management of dealing

525
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,120
with risk

526
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,919
we can transfer the risk and when we

527
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,960
talk about transferring the risk and

528
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,919
this is

529
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,480
largely insurance so we can take out

530
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,919
insurance

531
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,559
we can pay an insurance company

532
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,440
and

533
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,760
we transfer the risk to them it's no

534
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,400
longer our risk it's now there is if it

535
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,919
occurs they're the ones who feel the

536
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,440
impact they're the ones who have to pay

537
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,039
up

538
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,559
and ultimately we can accept the risk

539
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,640
we could say this is a risk we're

540
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,240
prepared to take

541
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,400
we're happy that it's it's something we

542
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,480
we're willing to do

543
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,880
in practice you're likely to go through

544
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,120
these um in order you're probably going

545
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,440
to look at a risk and say right can we

546
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,280
avoid it

547
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,520
how can we reduce it

548
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,000
can we transfer it or transfer part of

549
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,679
it i think it's worth mentioning that a

550
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,640
lot of it

551
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
sure things like reputational damage is

552
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
very hard your there will be impact

553
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,919
right even if you are covered

554
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,159
financially by your insurance company

555
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,679
and there's still the potential for a

556
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
cyber attack to affect your reputation

557
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,360
of it

558
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,799
and ultimately when you've done all of

559
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,159
that you get to the bottom and you say

560
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,400
okay now i'm happy i'm gonna accept and

561
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,760
what you are accepting

562
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,120
is the residual risk the level of risk

563
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,720
which is still there

564
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,200
after you've avoided reduced and

565
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,320
transferred what's left to accept is the

566
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,039
residual risk what level of risk

567
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,840
is

568
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
still there

569
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,159
after your controls

570
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,559
there's a couple of concepts that i

571
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,039
think are important to understand here

572
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,158
one is risk appetite

573
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,880
risk appetite

574
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,280
is the level of risk that a business has

575
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,320
decided it is comfortable accepting

576
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,240
so for larger companies and for public

577
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,919
companies you'll see this in things like

578
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,760
their annual reports there may be a

579
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,360
stated risk appetite

580
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
if it's not stated it's still a concept

581
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,600
that exists even if it's never been

582
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,840
written down so the board or the

583
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
management team or the

584
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
chief exec or the owner of the business

585
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
whoever is depending on the size will

586
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,840
have a risk appetite they will have a

587
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,080
level of risk they're willing to take

588
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,039
that they they deem to be

589
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,919
worth taking

590
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,520
a different concept of that

591
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,000
is risk capacity and it's an important

592
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,400
concept to understand i believe risk

593
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,559
capacity is not the level of risk you're

594
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,559
prepared to take it's the level of risk

595
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,960
you can with you can withstand

596
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,039
without the business going under

597
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,600
the capacity of the business to to be

598
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,760
hit by risk of tourism at risk at some

599
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,960
point there's a point where the company

600
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
can no longer trade

601
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,280
that it would go under that is the risk

602
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,640
capacity which is going to be a lot

603
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,840
bigger than your risk or you'd hope it's

604
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,640
a lot bigger than your risk appetite

605
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,080
useful to understand these these

606
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,520
concepts and this language

607
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,640
so

608
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
when you've avoided

609
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
reduced transferred and ultimately

610
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,760
accepted the residual risk

611
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
you're in this position and this is the

612
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,200
position this is how it should be

613
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,440
everyone should be aware of the risk and

614
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
aware of the level of residual aware of

615
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
the risk at the start

616
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
everyone should be aware of the

617
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,679
compensating controls what have we done

618
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,799
to address that risk how have we avoided

619
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,200
reduced transferred it

620
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,360
and everyone should be aware

621
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,840
of the level of residual risk that

622
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,320
remains

623
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,720
at this point the risk can be accepted

624
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,039
and i'm not going to go into technical

625
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,799
formal ways of doing this like risk

626
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,720
registers and like risk acceptance forms

627
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
and all of this kind of boring stuff

628
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,360
because it is vitally important that it

629
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,919
is reviewed and monitored going forward

630
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,400
because it can change

631
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,240
we know that risk is made up

632
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,400
of likelihood and impact

633
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,159
either of those two things can change

634
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,600
over time

635
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,799
the likelihood is made up of

636
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
vulnerability and threat

637
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,880
either of those two things can change

638
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,240
over time

639
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
the vulnerability no new vulnerability

640
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,360
could

641
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,600
be discovered the vulnerability could

642
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,720
become easier to exploit if there's like

643
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,919
public

644
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,000
proof of concept code if someone writes

645
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,679
a metasploit module to exploit a

646
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:38,960
vulnerability well suddenly that

647
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
vulnerability the same vulnerability has

648
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,159
now got a lot more likely to be

649
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,880
exploited because it's easier and can be

650
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,440
exploited by a larger amount of threats

651
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,760
the threat has increased because the

652
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,360
complexity of exploitation has gone down

653
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,640
i've gone over

654
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,320
i think a decent amount of content there

655
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,159
on the kind of basics of risk management

656
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,320
so i just wanted to cover quickly what i

657
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,720
think you can take away from this

658
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,679
and to summarize

659
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,480
i said it all the way through about what

660
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,240
risk being made up of likelihood and

661
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,440
impact

662
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,720
likelihood being made up of

663
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
vulnerability and threat

664
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,400
how impact could be onto the cia triad

665
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,080
or how it could be

666
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,159
one of the five categories we spoke of

667
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,559
earlier

668
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,559
i also spoke about

669
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,360
how risk can be dealt with how it can be

670
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,120
avoided reduced transferred or accepted

671
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,600
i'm happy now to take questions as long

672
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,760
as i haven't bought anyone to tears to

673
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,080
sleep

674
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,799
fantastic

675
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,279
that was a fantastic first talk

676
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,240
thanks for thank you for giving it

677
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,000
that's pretty fun we do have a few

678
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,240
questions actually um

679
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,679
so let me just

680
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,360
load them up

681
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,320
um

682
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,799
so ray redacted asks uh you made a great

683
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,559
point that we can only control the

684
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,480
vulnerability part of the vulnerability

685
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,080
time spread equation

686
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,320
do you have any recommendation on how we

687
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,480
could better assess the vulnerability

688
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,919
part

689
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,520
oh i mean i could i could do a whole

690
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,039
talk on vulnerability management because

691
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,120
i i i'm a big i love vulnerability

692
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,960
management

693
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,799
but really it's about

694
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,159
if i was going to answer that question

695
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,400
as quickly and as short as i can be it

696
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,039
would be about knowing what you have and

697
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,200
asset management so you really need to

698
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,480
understand what you you have

699
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,720
and as a starting point

700
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,480
just look at it from the internet the

701
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,159
the vast majority of attacks are going

702
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,320
to be coming from the internet so

703
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,080
good asset management from from an

704
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,840
internet point of view and the way i've

705
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,200
done that in the past you can do that

706
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
using open source tools and you can just

707
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,320
do it yourself using things like nmap

708
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,640
just do a load of port scans of your ip

709
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,400
ranges get some idea of what's on those

710
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,640
systems and then if you can do

711
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,559
vulnerability scanning

712
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,000
and there are open source tools to do

713
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,600
that i've never really used them i would

714
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,360
normally use commercial tools to do that

715
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,600
but then to get a visibility on what it

716
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,159
looks like from the outside um and then

717
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,000
internally

718
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
talk to your it teams and make sure that

719
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,679
they've got like good patching and

720
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,480
processes in play

721
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,039
that's uh yeah uh even you want to take

722
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,480
an axon

723
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,919
yeah actually i had a question myself

724
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,159
so tom how does risk assessment tie in

725
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,600
with threat modeling is this something

726
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,799
like that should be considered one

727
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,640
threat modeling and are the or are they

728
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,400
these practices a bit more independent

729
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,520
do you think

730
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
so threat threat modeling was like was

731
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,919
an item that i had on my potential to

732
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,600
get into the talk

733
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,440
when i was planning it but it's not an

734
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,880
area that i'm that familiar with i've

735
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,440
not done a lot of threat modelling um

736
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,400
in the past so yes it does because when

737
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
i spoke about

738
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,360
talking about likelihood being

739
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
vulnerability times threat

740
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,120
threat modeling would sit within that

741
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,279
threat side of that equation to really

742
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,200
help you to understand that

743
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
and to look at

744
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,159
and if you would be talk you would be

745
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,360
touched on the vulnerability side as

746
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,240
well but you to get an idea of

747
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
who's trying to exploit this how are

748
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,720
they trying to exploit it how easy is it

749
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,000
to exploit you know how many people are

750
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,600
trying to exploit it and that would help

751
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,080
you to work out that

752
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,360
likelihood

753
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,640
via threat and vulnerability awesome

754
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,399
makes sense nikos do you want to take

755
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,679
the next question

756
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,559
sure

757
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,320
um so

758
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,960
go see uh asked how do you explain risk

759
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,120
to a non-security team to have them

760
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
understand why you're asking them to do

761
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,360
extra work

762
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,000
okay so i like to focus on

763
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,480
um the impact

764
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,440
to them

765
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,159
you know and and to say look and i think

766
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,720
it's the reason that i said over and

767
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,399
over and over again and the reason that

768
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,720
many of my slides said risk equals

769
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
likelihood times threat is because i

770
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,159
just i really think that that

771
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,919
sounds like a very simple concept but

772
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,080
understanding it helps you to have those

773
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,600
conversations it just means you can

774
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
frame that conversation with those

775
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
non-security people you can say

776
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,120
listen guys i've looked at this and i

777
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,559
deemed that it's actually quite likely

778
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,480
that this could happen and the reason

779
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,000
that that's quite likely that that could

780
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
happen is because the threat is big and

781
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,440
the vulnerability is easy and you can

782
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,039
say look

783
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,039
um we talk about threat and one thing

784
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,960
that maybe some people outside of our

785
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,559
industry don't understand

786
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,440
is

787
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,399
we're not all threats aren't targeted so

788
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,919
people tell they won't we're not a

789
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,760
target we're a small business why would

790
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,399
we be targeted well it doesn't matter

791
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,640
one part of the threat is just in

792
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,799
spraying the internet right there are

793
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,640
vulnerabilities that are just people are

794
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,159
looking to exploit by just looking

795
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,480
across the entire internet i think when

796
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,760
you start to explain that to

797
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,240
non-security people and you can say um

798
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,600
we don't need to be targeted these

799
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,120
attacks are untargeted they're just

800
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,480
being sprayed

801
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,799
this is easy to exploit and depending on

802
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,399
your skill level um i've certainly had

803
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,480
very good results by demonstrating

804
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,399
exploitation myself

805
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,679
like if you can say to an it person look

806
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,919
i have a shell on your system from the

807
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,120
internet

808
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,760
right if i can do it then another

809
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,000
attacker can do it and the impact of

810
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,200
that look

811
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,760
i have root access i can i can pivot i

812
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,520
can let you know so i think just trying

813
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,440
to frame it

814
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,120
in terms of

815
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,159
threat vulnerability like good impact

816
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,760
really really helps to get your message

817
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,760
across
