1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,160
thanks for that um yeah i just want to

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,920
before i even start say thanks to the

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,799
digital overdose um team for providing a

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,960
platform for us to have talks like this

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,120
and

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,279
to share my experience my first

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,800
physical ex

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
physical assessment experience as a

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,640
redeemer

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,400
so just a quick agenda what i would like

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,199
to go through like a quick overview

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,040
is i'm going to quickly tell you a

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
little bit about myself i don't i won't

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
waffle on about that too much i'll go

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,160
into what the assignment was actually

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,239
and then i'll explain the fishing and

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,600
the machine

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,680
that we performed on the client

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,399
the recon that i did of the premises how

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,199
i eventually gained access there and

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,360
then just a couple of mistakes

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,800
and listen so

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,879
mistake from my side and from the client

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,120
side and then obviously lessons from

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
both sides as well

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,319
so just a a little quick run through of

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,479
who i am i obtained my first dc

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,439
when

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,720
i was eight years old from there i

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,439
learned

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,840
too basic at when i was 11 years old

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,000
the first

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,159
you know so my first unofficial hack if

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,439
i can call it that and i call it

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,920
unofficial because there wasn't really

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,200
permission

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,119
granted or i called it a um

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,400
unofficial

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,799
unexpected penetration test which

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,560
resulted in me

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,880
taking over isp basically i was young i

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,840
was 13 at that age i mean

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,799
i'm sure

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,479
i won't get into trouble for mentioning

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,280
that

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,600
then due to my interest in computers

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
that i carried on

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,560
i started the it business at ages of 17

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,880
from there i carry on with the business

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,920
obtained my computer science degree

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,079
and then at some stage my

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
it business

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,399
transformed into a software development

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,360
house um and then recently i got into

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,119
ctf

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,680
with the with the hack south crew and

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,319
check them out on discord quite a nice

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,720
bunch of guys and then i eventually got

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,040
into my first official penetration

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,599
testing job so currently i'm employed as

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,160
a penetration tester slash red teamer at

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,680
checkmark cyber

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
i've over the last year now i've gone

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,080
through a bit of a spate of obtaining

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,000
certifications through offensive

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,519
security so i've gone got my own cpo set

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,080
o sweo said osc3 and i've also done the

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
pn

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,160
in pt from tcm security and also

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,440
recently faces from princess academy if

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
you're looking for me anywhere

72

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,440
like i love discussing

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,760
um acting stuff with anybody and then

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,560
i've got a blog running

80
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,280
chrismeister.edu.io and you'll actually

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,640
find this whole

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
talk on the as well that i wrote down as

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,080
a blog post

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,200
a quick disclaimer i'm relatively new in

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,720
the official hacking scene

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,080
so i've been a hacker all my life but

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,120
officially only for a year and a bit now

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,040
so what i might be saying

89
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,599
might come across wrong

90
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,920
please i'm open to corrections anytime

91
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,519
that anybody has

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
perfections or suggestions and

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,159
whatever i say

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,480
go go and research do your own research

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,159
before you just accept what what i say

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,959
okay so getting into the actual talk so

97
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,680
the assignment that we got was a full

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
black box

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
um penetration test for the company

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,920
basically what that meant is they gave

101
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,400
us the company name and said go and test

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
the security see what we can do

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
so our goal

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
well first of all i was quite excited

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,280
for this i mean it took about what four

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
to five months for this to actually

107
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,959
materialize from hearing about the first

108
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,239
time

109
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,720
so i was quite excited when it

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
eventually came because

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,639
in our country i'm from south africa

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,279
there isn't a lot of opportunity for or

113
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,360
tests like this um just based on the

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
fact that it costs a lot and i've

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,520
actually spoken to a lot of penetration

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,680
testers after the fact

117
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,440
when i started sharing my story and a

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
lot of people are actually scared to go

119
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,639
and attend doing these things just based

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,479
on the um

121
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,680
the

122
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,919
our security guards and with the crime

123
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,600
rate in the country which is probably

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
not which is probably on par with the

125
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,120
rest of the world i just think maybe our

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
security guards are but figure out the

127
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,680
year so people are very

128
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,600
wary of attempting physical assessments

129
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,759
but anyway i was excited for it so our

130
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,040
goal

131
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
was that we

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
we had a feeling in the team that we

133
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
would

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,720
gain

135
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,639
full domain

136
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,960
control if we could just get access into

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,199
the internal network and we based this

138
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
on the fact that they haven't done even

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,600
a white optic test internal test before

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
so we knew there would probably be a lot

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
of opportunities for

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
us to be able to escalate our privileges

143
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,440
once we got onto the internal domain

144
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,120
so the goal was the main admin and in my

145
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
mind i wouldn't wouldn't accept anything

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
less

147
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,720
so then

148
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,560
so then yeah at the start of it we

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
started performing ocean on the company

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,440
um that meant going on to twitter going

151
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,520
onto linkedin finding employees of the

152
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,000
company starting to build email

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,080
email address lists

154
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,400
and employer lists trying to find the

155
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,240
interests and all that just so that we

156
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,600
had a base of

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
things that we can attack if we wanted

158
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,080
to

159
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
uh for example do fishing or wishing

160
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,160
which we ended up doing anyway but we

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,400
didn't need to do like a spirit that was

162
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,280
what abroad for all the tech that we

163
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,840
eventually did so anyway then we found

164
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,720
all the external facing infrastructure

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,199
did enumeration on it find found open

166
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,160
ports etc etc so we were looking for

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,880
like low-end food initially um i must

168
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,199
say i recommend this company they are

169
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
quite well secured in terms of the

170
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
external stuff

171
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,919
besides

172
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,720
one web application that i've found a

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
vulnerability in that allowed me to

174
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
purchase

175
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,360
airtime for a sim card and data

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
without actually paying for it so i was

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
able to

178
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,360
basically cost them money by

179
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
just loading vouchers onto my own sim

180
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,280
card

181
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,840
which comes into play a bit later so

182
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,759
besides for that we were quite happy

183
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,720
that the the internal infrastructure

184
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,759
sorry the external facing was quite good

185
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,960
so then we decided okay we now need to

186
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
to find a way to find credentials if we

187
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,520
can't get get through a vulnerability on

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
the external side so we decided to do

189
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
some fishing first and then fishing

190
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,400
after that

191
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
the fishing

192
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720
uh we we had about 40 email addresses

193
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
from our ocean so

194
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,960
i went through my normal procedure of

195
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,960
what i do to set up a phishing campaign

196
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,440
we got everything set up i hit the same

197
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,680
button and not absolutely nothing

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,599
happened there wasn't a click and

199
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,919
nothing absolutely nothing

200
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,680
so i just left it for a couple of days

201
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,039
carried on with some of the external

202
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,199
testing and then i decided to just go

203
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,199
back and look at the logs and lo and

204
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,680
behold the at the exact time that i

205
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
clicked to send out permission there was

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
actually a problem with the mail server

207
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
so none of those emails went out

208
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,639
so that at least gave me a

209
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,000
little bit of a hope

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,960
and we sent through a second second

211
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,440
phase of the phishing attack and through

212
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,919
that i was actually able to

213
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,120
get a

214
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,479
one credential out of the people um

215
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,240
which was in it's it's normally enough

216
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,479
um normally i have a better strike rate

217
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,800
but anyway so we got this credential i

218
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
logged into the

219
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,479
email the first thing i started looking

220
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,680
for was the nd dells which i found

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,599
but unfortunately they had to form

222
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,919
two form factor

223
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,800
um available i've activated on those

224
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,280
accounts so i couldn't i couldn't log in

225
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,479
without that

226
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,560
two formal authentication

227
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
pin code that would be sent to their

228
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,120
cell phone

229
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,919
so i sort of gave up on that idea

230
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,679
i found a lot of usernames and passwords

231
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,679
that would be connected to external

232
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,839
services that they make use of which we

233
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,519
didn't touch because that was obviously

234
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,760
not within the scope

235
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
then i also noticed that the i.t

236
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
department

237
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,360
detected our phishing attack because

238
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,279
they sent out the email to the whole

239
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,560
company and say there's a phishing

240
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,120
attack happening if you're if you

241
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
clicked on the link provided your

242
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
credentials contact the i.t department

243
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
so that your password can get reset

244
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
so i just quickly deleted it out of this

245
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,320
user's email box and they weren't aware

246
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,399
that something had happened

247
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,200
and

248
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
thank goodness for that because i could

249
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,519
until the end of the engagement these

250
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,959
credentials

251
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
stayed active and i could use them and i

252
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,279
actually use them eventually to do

253
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,399
the final takeover of the domain

254
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,560
then okay so with the

255
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,959
fishing being successful for us we

256
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,880
decided to go into the vision

257
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,040
would be that's basically doing phishing

258
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,160
through the

259
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,720
um using telephones

260
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,839
so

261
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,440
you would phone up the

262
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,399
people

263
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,399
try and get them to give you some sort

264
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,320
of info this was the very first time

265
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
that i've had to do something like this

266
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,800
so

267
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,959
i struggled for a couple of days to just

268
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,959
like wrap my head around okay what is

269
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,800
the end goal going to be

270
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,640
when you do this vision what do i need

271
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,000
from it

272
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,680
eventually i decide okay you know what i

273
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
can't wait any longer so i decided to

274
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,839
just start phoning up the branches of

275
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,000
the company and sort of just see what

276
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,959
happens

277
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
to add insult to injury i made use of

278
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,720
the

279
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
vouchers for the sim card that i

280
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,800
actually was able to pull off their site

281
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,720
that i didn't pay for and i used that to

282
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,120
to phone them so we were making use of

283
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
their own infrastructure not

284
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,360
infrastructure their own money if i can

285
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,000
call it them to phone them and wishing

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,880
them

287
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,600
so

288
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,240
my first attempt at that i phoned up

289
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
said listen i'm x from head office id i

290
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,040
just need to speak to someone about

291
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,160
computers

292
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,720
um we're seeing that the antivirus isn't

293
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
updating and we're just worried that

294
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,519
something is going to happen

295
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,880
and you're going to lose all your data

296
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,600
so i'm trying to prevent that

297
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,680
and the the first lady that i spoke to

298
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,680
she was quite happy to

299
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,360
give me anything that i need from her i

300
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,760
got passwords from her i was able to get

301
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
her to run commands on her pc because i

302
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,079
was trying to do rebound to see all the

303
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,680
computers connected to the internet

304
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,959
which they weren't

305
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,200
um but based on the proxy

306
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,480
message that was coming up i thought

307
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,079
maybe it was just a proxy setting that

308
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,839
would need to be set up because i need

309
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,560
to needed to gain info on what i could

310
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
expect when i actually gained access

311
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,040
physical access to the to the offices

312
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,320
and from from

313
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
the discussion with her and a couple of

314
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,000
other stores that i found with a sort of

315
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240
similar script i was able to determine

316
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,720
that they had a

317
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,560
a password pattern full of that so

318
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,720
they would so i would easily be able to

319
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,880
guess if someone gave me a username i

320
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
would able to sort of figure out what

321
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,040
their password would be and it turned

322
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,200
out the administrator password said the

323
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,279
same pattern

324
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,720
just a side note on that i actually

325
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,880
still feel quite bad about it uh one

326
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,440
lady actually had a genuine i.t problem

327
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
thinking that i'm from haiti and i told

328
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,959
her that there would be someone that

329
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,880
comes could come out to the premises to

330
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
come and sort it out so i do hope that

331
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,399
someone did come and sort it out

332
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
otherwise she still still has an issue

333
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,079
there um

334
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,720
the commands that i had the people run

335
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
it was typical ping come on that would

336
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,399
sharper error and

337
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,240
that just let me

338
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,760
gave me the opportunity to say okay

339
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,040
listen something is wrong on your

340
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
computer we're gonna send out a local

341
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,639
guide to coming out because we don't we

342
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,160
obviously don't fly someone down from

343
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,240
where we are from your office so just

344
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
expect someone and

345
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,240
um yeah that gave me the

346
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
opportunity to to

347
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,839
have a

348
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,880
story of when i actually go go there so

349
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,560
the first

350
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,920
time that i

351
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
decided to go to one of the stores i

352
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,000
just went to go and do some recon just

353
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,320
to see what is in the store i needed to

354
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,800
see what type of security they've got

355
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,680
how

356
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,200
vigilant are they

357
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,519
how do they secure the security interact

358
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,040
with the clients of the store how busy

359
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,440
is the store what are the where are the

360
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,680
high value areas and the areas of the

361
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,920
computers and the servers and that

362
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,560
so i needed to establish all that

363
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,720
and again i just went to the store open

364
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
mind

365
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,639
pretended i'm

366
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,040
one of the shoppers there got a trolley

367
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,399
walk through the place

368
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,920
so the the

369
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,079
things that i noticed they were like the

370
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,680
security guard was more interested in

371
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,120
checking that the people are wearing

372
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,360
mosques and sanitizing there's a store

373
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,160
in the

374
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,240
cover times

375
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,079
and then you would randomly check people

376
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,279
that went out the store they would

377
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,040
actually use like search their handbags

378
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,639
and whatever backpacks and things that

379
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,200
they had there was cctv all over i

380
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,959
didn't know if someone was sitting

381
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,320
monitoring them

382
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,560
there was a vacant network jack that i

383
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,440
found

384
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,680
that actually had a power source

385
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
close by as well so that provided

386
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,000
perfect opportunity for me to to build

387
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,959
and test

388
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,279
at dropbox for the first time dropbox is

389
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,760
just a little computer and i mean it's

390
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,360
as big as a cell phone that you can plug

391
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,320
into the network have access to

392
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,880
and from there you could basically be

393
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,720
connected to their network to do

394
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
enumeration and try and

395
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
compromise them

396
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,519
so i also found where the offices were i

397
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,560
saw that there's no like physical

398
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
barrier to enter the offices to get to

399
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,680
the server room so i could see them see

400
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,360
all of that through the corridor leading

401
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,959
into the office

402
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,199
so

403
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,519
having gotten all the infra that i

404
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,440
needed to and i've already formulated

405
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,600
the exact plan that i was gonna do when

406
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
i go there

407
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
i headed back to the office and started

408
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,519
preparing

409
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,240
my little tools so i built a little fire

410
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,800
box with um kelly on there as a dropbox

411
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,959
you look on my blog

412
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,519
page you'll see uh website you'll see

413
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,279
that i actually wrote what a detailed

414
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,000
article on how i bought the box

415
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,959
and on exhalt i actually did talk and

416
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,040
explain to you guys how i do it so

417
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,600
um have a look there um i'm happy to

418
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,839
also get suggestions if you guys have

419
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,000
any um

420
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,399
comments or suggestions on that for me

421
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,199
so then i also added like a usb drive

422
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,040
that i loaded up some tools like mini

423
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,160
cats um built a custom reverse shell

424
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
that had antibodies bypassing in case i

425
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,120
could get a pc with an uh internet

426
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,440
connection that i could call that the cq

427
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,560
server

428
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,880
and just a bunch of enumeration tools

429
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,800
just a side note like if you ever do

430
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,600
this just zip up the

431
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,519
the tools with the password because

432
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,120
otherwise as soon as you plug in any

433
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
defender or any antivirus is gonna pick

434
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
it up and kill kill your tools and then

435
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,800
you sit there with anything without

436
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,639
anything then i'll just add like other

437
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,800
random stuff with me as well usb

438
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
charging cable i had another laptop that

439
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,199
i had cali on that was set up to connect

440
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,360
to the dropbox file wi-fi and i even had

441
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,839
kelly on a lock and a live galley on a

442
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,800
usb drive in case i could plug in and

443
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
then from my old ip business i still had

444
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,279
my company id badge which clearly

445
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,440
indicated that i'm an iq support person

446
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,519
so i made sure

447
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,800
i wore that

448
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
that day

449
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,639
funny thing is um i was taking my kid to

450
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,320
school that morning having breast

451
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,560
already and even he noticed that oh

452
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,079
something something is different because

453
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,160
i'm not he's not used to seeing me in

454
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,720
jeans and then button up shirt and

455
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,480
things like that so and then i explained

456
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,079
to you the five year old what i'm going

457
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,920
to go and do so

458
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,720
i'm

459
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,920
quite

460
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,680
i was quite interested afterwards when

461
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,279
you kept on asking me about because i

462
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
explained to him we're gonna go and try

463
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,199
and see if we can access the people's

464
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,880
bank account that was the easiest way

465
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
for me to explain to you and afterwards

466
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,360
the afternoon he wanted to do

467
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
when he was he saw that i was sitting on

468
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
the computer he wanted to come and sit

469
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,120
you want me to show him okay

470
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,800
how can i see the people's bank

471
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
statements for example

472
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,480
so yeah it was quite interesting the way

473
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,880
that he grasped that

474
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
okay then okay so the first time that i

475
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,880
actually went to the store with all my

476
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,959
tools and okay i'm gonna i'm gonna do

477
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,720
this now

478
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,440
i

479
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,279
stopped there i thought i was relatively

480
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,600
gone as i was walking up to the door

481
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
like a million things ran through my

482
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,920
head that could go wrong

483
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
and

484
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,039
it's a good time to note that during

485
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,480
these assessments you normally have a

486
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,079
what they call a get out of jail free

487
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,640
card which is a letter from the company

488
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,919
to say

489
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,839
this guy has permission to do what he

490
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,160
does if he does get caught then call the

491
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,799
cops call this guy we will

492
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,119
confirm your old story

493
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,599
four reasons that i can't go into now we

494
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,280
didn't have this in place yet but we

495
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,559
were running out of time for the

496
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,880
assessment but we did oh we obviously

497
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,480
had the position we just didn't have

498
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,520
that official later so i took a bit of a

499
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
gamble and decided okay

500
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,200
hopefully i don't end off in the cop

501
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,080
shop

502
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,360
today

503
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,240
as i got to the security guard

504
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
my mind was completely clear and i was

505
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,679
relaxed i just had told myself just just

506
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,760
pick him that you belong here i went up

507
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,160
to him i greeted him i

508
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
explained to him who i was what i was

509
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,799
doing there and i asked him if he could

510
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,039
point in the direction of the

511
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,160
of the offices which he was happy to do

512
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
and i think that that was the important

513
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,840
step for me because i want i didn't want

514
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,160
the security guard to wonder later on

515
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
who is this guy what is he doing that

516
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,919
are you i wanted him to know exactly

517
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,360
this is why i'm there

518
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,919
and don't even worry about asking me

519
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,960
again

520
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,000
so

521
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
as i walk through the offices i had

522
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,880
another little brainwave i thought lego

523
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,400
just pretend that i'm on the phone with

524
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,039
the ita office

525
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,400
and i pretend that i'm speaking to

526
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,440
someone um i did it loud enough so that

527
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,600
anybody within earshot could hear me and

528
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,280
i just said listen okay i just got here

529
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,440
i'm going to see what's going on uh give

530
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,919
me 15 20 minutes i'll find you back now

531
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,960
at the u.s site report to say what we

532
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,799
can do to fix the problem and that

533
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,919
little

534
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,400
trick worked because

535
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
i hadn't even pretended to put the phone

536
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,240
down and the lady came out of her office

537
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,559
and said oh are you that it guy that the

538
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
i was already in no one had any

539
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,720
suspicion of me i was i could walk into

540
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,160
any of the offices

541
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,720
um like just just abandon things that

542
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,799
caught my attention in people's handbags

543
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,320
cell phones everything was lying all

544
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,039
over i could have easily if i were if i

545
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,000
were a malicious person i've caused some

546
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
financial damage there go by stealing

547
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,880
stuff

548
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,559
okay so anyway i was part of the

549
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,720
furniture there and they let me into the

550
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
server room the server room is just a

551
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
little a little

552
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,120
small little room that looked like it's

553
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,039
actually supposed to be for like storage

554
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,000
of

555
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,760
cleaning products and things like that

556
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,720
the

557
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,640
handle wasn't even a proper handle it

558
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,039
was a broken angle so i could get in

559
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,600
there to the server access everything i

560
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
could close the door behind me side full

561
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,919
privacy to do what i wanted to do

562
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,880
i got

563
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,760
my dropbox out connected to the network

564
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,400
that worked perfectly i could access it

565
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,720
from our laptop i could access it from

566
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,320
our sorry not yet from our c2 server so

567
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,919
the first little hurdle that i had to

568
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,480
cross there is that there was no dhcp

569
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,640
on a small hurdle so i just had to set

570
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,880
up a static item but then i realized

571
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,320
okay but there's no

572
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,400
in internet i can't access the internet

573
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,360
from that

574
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,640
network sub

575
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
subnet

576
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,679
i tested for

577
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,640
proxy servers couldn't find anything

578
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,679
so

579
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,520
the dropbox idea wasn't going to work so

580
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,840
i tried the tools um mini cats don't

581
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,600
want people because they were running

582
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,880
windows 2000 windows server 2003 and xp

583
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
so the version i had was for later

584
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,159
versions

585
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,600
um

586
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,960
so but

587
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,880
bonuses for me is that

588
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,799
all the workstations were locked in as

589
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,000
admin

590
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,400
local admin users the server was logged

591
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,960
in as an administrator not locked so i

592
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,200
could see stuff on the server but even

593
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,919
from the server i couldn't access

594
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,720
access the internet so i decided okay

595
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,880
when an hour passed i thought okay that

596
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,200
was my limit let me get out here go and

597
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,520
regroup see what i can do

598
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,720
to come back and and get to get a bit

599
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,039
more success i went back to the office

600
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,480
brainstormed a bit

601
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,559
realized okay let me just put a

602
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,400
3g connection

603
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
on my dropbox as well so that would

604
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,640
connect the dropbox directly to the

605
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,520
internet connect to our c2 servers and

606
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,400
let me allow it to do everything that i

607
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,640
wanted to do initially so i was quite

608
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,240
annoyed with myself for not thinking

609
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
about that the first time

610
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,159
anyway so i went back

611
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,960
this time when i walked into uh onto

612
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,520
their premises we had cash and transit

613
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,280
guys that were busy loading money from

614
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,480
the atm

615
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
so that was quite a

616
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,320
a little bit of a scare thing and seeing

617
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,559
these people with guns and all that

618
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,280
so

619
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,240
again i had permission to be there but

620
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,360
for me

621
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,120
guys like that um

622
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,039
in our country they get targeted quite

623
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,240
often if not daily so i i knew these

624
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,760
guys would also be

625
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,600
quite sensitive to anybody acting

626
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,320
strange around me so i had to once again

627
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,960
tell myself okay calm down walk past

628
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
them don't even

629
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
think about it just just get get through

630
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,280
it

631
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,760
so yes i got into the property no one

632
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
shot me uh

633
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,280
went straight to the

634
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,120
to the manager again told her that's not

635
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,000
back i think i've got a

636
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
solution to the problem now

637
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,919
so got back into the server room

638
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,559
connected to dropbox tested that the 3g

639
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,400
is working all the connections that were

640
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,919
perfectly

641
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,720
tested from our c2 server okay i thought

642
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,679
that was it i walked and walked out got

643
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,679
back to our office connected to the

644
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,520
dropbox great i could still connect to

645
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,960
it started enumeration and basically the

646
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,919
box died without within a couple of

647
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,400
minutes of demolition and i realized the

648
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,480
heat that i felt in that little room

649
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,960
that day was affecting the dropbox and

650
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,000
obviously

651
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
freezing it up

652
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,159
so then i was i was super annoyed it was

653
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,880
hot i didn't want to go there again but

654
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,440
i just just decided okay listen ah they

655
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,080
have given me free rain there now i'm

656
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,760
just gonna set up a spa laptop that i've

657
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,840
got and use that as my dropbox then i

658
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
went out for heat issues i've got a nice

659
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
powerful machine there

660
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,799
so set it up i went there

661
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,520
again just told the lady i've come back

662
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,280
doing xyz

663
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,960
went into the server room hooked this

664
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,080
thing up and it just tested everything

665
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,960
is working got back to the to

666
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,799
our office i was able to connect and

667
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,480
start doing enumeration and everything

668
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,240
was working perfectly

669
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,400
so then i was able to

670
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
see that the their network is actually

671
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
connected throughout the country to all

672
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
the branches i could access their head

673
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,159
office i could access absolutely

674
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,200
everything

675
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,840
so i was able to make use of kerberos

676
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,039
attack and and the old me17 exploit to

677
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,960
actually just take over the the whole

678
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,840
network there so that was a success so

679
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,400
just a a summary of like

680
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
mistakes i assumed that there was going

681
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,760
to be an internet connection there

682
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,480
wasn't i built a failover but the

683
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,640
failover just wasn't enough i didn't

684
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,320
take into account the heat even though i

685
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,240
felt it it should have registered with

686
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,400
me this little device isn't going to

687
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,480
work and then eventually i just decided

688
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,960
to think big get a laptop in there get a

689
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,880
proper computer and make sure i've got

690
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
all the connections and everything

691
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,440
running and yeah that that gave a

692
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,279
success at the end of the day

693
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,360
then just the lessons that i learned

694
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,640
quickly is

695
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,200
i just be prepared for any anything try

696
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,279
and roll with it don't get too upset sit

697
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,240
with it and just also just

698
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,559
act like you belong at the place

699
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,039
and then just a main thing that i can

700
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,039
maybe do to companies to prevent

701
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,720
something like this is the segmentation

702
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,480
of the network make sure that one

703
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,039
computer one computer on a network that

704
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,120
is compromised can't access your your

705
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,919
whole network and then provide training

706
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,919
for for staff um

707
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,159
ongoing training about the physical

708
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,760
threat to the

709
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,240
experience at the offices training about

710
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,600
their fishing

711
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,840
uh trading but train them about fishing

712
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,039
and all that

713
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,480
so yeah that's that's my talk um

719
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,480
uh

720
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,320
someone actually remarked uh that was

721
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,480
kind of funny you know when you said i

722
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,919
was a good engagement because i didn't

723
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,559
get shot

724
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,559
that's a good one

725
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,159
anytime that you don't get shocked and

726
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,159
you engage with this good

727
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,400
yeah

728
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,720
i mean you

729
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
does this often happen that you have

730
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,679
like a similar consideration like you go

731
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,200
somewhere you're like i hope i don't get

732
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,720
shot today

733
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,640
well let me tell you

734
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,400
we went through a split of a lot of

735
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,960
these caching transit hijackings taking

736
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,320
place in our country and locally even so

737
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
whenever we at a shopping center and you

738
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,480
see these guys walk through they it does

739
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,400
play on your mind so that's why there's

740
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,840
even more people than building that

741
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
engagement for me that i'm sort of doing

742
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,320
something illegal here now

743
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,760
i don't want these guys to be nervous

744
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,640
around

745
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,200
and with and i understand why because

746
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,440
they you know they're not the the best

747
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,360
paid people and they do what

748
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,279
right

749
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,720
let's see if there's any questions in

750
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,480
chat

751
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
um

752
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,480
not that much um right

753
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,720
so when you introduce yourself to the

754
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,919
security guard did you introduce

755
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,279
yourself as a pentester did you

756
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,279
introduce yourself as someone who is

757
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,440
here to you know uh

758
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,360
perform some operations

759
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,279
oh yeah okay or maybe i wasn't too clear

760
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,640
on that yes

761
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,360
my whole persona there was i was i t

762
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,600
support person that had opposite

763
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
subcontracted down to me

764
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,159
so anything that i did i'm united like i

765
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,440
said my old

766
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,799
i.t support

767
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,440
company i had the badge there that save

768
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,279
computer services with my name and

769
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,799
everything on there so

770
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,320
yeah no i didn't go in there and say

771
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,159
there's no

772
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,840
i'm here to hack you

773
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,000
yeah

774
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,159
i don't think they

775
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,960
understood if i said that i might still

776
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,399
have gained access

777
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,840
i don't think it would have raised too

778
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,240
many questions

779
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,640
awesome

780
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,000
what uh

781
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,279
i believe that concludes

782
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,399
uh yeah the time for this talk

783
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,000
someone mentioned in chat that most

784
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,279
americans can relate to not getting shot

785
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,000
as a born and raised american myself i

786
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,679
can tell you that resonated personally

787
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,640
with me

788
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,640
um

789
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,600
when i started sharing the story and

790
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,159
they are all of their opinion as well

791
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,840
that they do not like the physical side

792
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,000
of them and if they can they actually

793
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,919
won't do it and that's i think that's

794
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,279
why there's a lot

795
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,679
there isn't a lot of opportunity for for

796
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,760
engagements like this i mean i've been

797
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,840
with it now for just over a year with

798
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,120
this company and it's the first time

799
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,840
that the opportunity like this has arose

800
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,919
and i don't think opportunity like this

801
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,799
will come up very soon
