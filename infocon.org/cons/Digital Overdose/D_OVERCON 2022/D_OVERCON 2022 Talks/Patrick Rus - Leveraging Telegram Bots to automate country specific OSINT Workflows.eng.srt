1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,120
so um i'm patrick i'm a non-think

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,839
investigator uh working in

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,320
the intellectual property space

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,559
uh covering uh both

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
brand protection and content protection

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,920
areas

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,720
so today

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,279
i will speak about

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,080
telegram both

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,960
more exactly about how to leverage

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,159
telegram both to conduct country

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,840
specifically since

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
investigations

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
so the story

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,520
is inspired

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,480
from

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,760
a bbc animated series

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,480
called

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,320
little robots

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,719
which was originally released in 2003

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,000
and ended in 2005 it's pretty old

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
so

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,199
i will cover uh three chapters and

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,359
five subchapters

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,160
so first i will give you an introduction

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,840
about

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,720
telegram what is telegram and

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,360
telegram ecosystem then i will move on

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,400
to

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
austin telegram both

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,240
then i will cover

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,439
five

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,880
subchapters

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,840
which are a bit of give and take

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,759
this corresponds to personal

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,320
identifiable information research the

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,640
second one is where study

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
uh which covers uh social media

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,640
intelligence

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,159
uh the third one red alert which is uh

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,520
about the searching leaked data

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,560
the fourth one the best time bedbots

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,159
which is uh about darker monitoring and

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,360
the last one not involved cracker switch

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,720
which covers

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,200
domain and ip investigations finally i

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,159
will end with a live demon and some

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,600
takeaways and future projects

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,759
all right so

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,880
let's

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,000
speak about telegram telegram was born

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,680
in

53
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,520
2013

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,920
by two brothers nikolai and pavel durov

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,160
in saint petersburg russia

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
they were both

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
shareholders

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,440
in

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,760
the contact

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,239
which is a russian social media platform

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,000
uh before 2013 then they

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
you know founded

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,760
telegram

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,800
and

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,760
moved

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,120
moved in dubai

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
where they live

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
and now they manage the company from

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
dubai

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,720
and also there is the operations

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,319
domicile is in um

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,599
british

73
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,560
you know in a british island

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,040
territory

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,959
all right so currently telegram has

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,720
around

77
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,480
550 million users

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,599
and over uh

79
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,200
100 million people have downloaded the

80
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,440
app in 2021

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,400
so telegram is uh a valuable resource

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,879
for investigating darpa vendors uh

83
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,480
piracy networks counterfeit sellers

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
and

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,360
other

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,720
entities

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,200
the telegram consists of individual

88
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,400
users public channels private groups

89
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,120
secret chats and bots

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
we are going to

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,959
touch uh

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,280
open telegram boats

93
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,959
and

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,000
we are going to focus more on

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
ocean telegram boats so telegram boasts

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
our third party applications which

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,280
are running within telegram they perform

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,560
predefined

99
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
tasks

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,640
and they can be used in

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,840
a variety of purposes

102
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,319
you can build telegram boats using uh

103
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,200
for example a boat fader which is the

104
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,920
official telegram uh boat for building

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
uh boats

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
and uh

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,599
of course there are other ways

108
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,200
to build telegram

109
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,399
just a bit of statistics about telegram

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,918
which is growing tremendously

111
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,120
worldwide

112
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,080
so

113
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,240
i have provided two

114
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
screenshots on the right hand side for

115
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,280
example at the top we have telegram.org

116
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,720
and we can see that russia is at the top

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,520
country in terms of user traffic we have

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,360
brazil italy ukraine spain we also have

119
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,080
the bottom telegram that me where we can

120
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,040
see india russia ukraine united states

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,639
iran

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
so in many places especially those with

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,560
large demography telegram is

124
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,040
is very important

125
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,360
and has started to

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,479
to

127
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,240
become a very um you know used platform

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,199
so before um an off synth investigation

129
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,120
um i will cover three main components

130
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
so first is to identify

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,639
um

132
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,400
telegram both so how we identify

133
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,360
telegram boards for all sync purposes

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,240
then

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,160
how we vet them

136
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
and then how we

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,840
uh deploy them

138
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
all right so

139
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
a little bit about identification of the

140
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,000
oxygen telegram boats we can find the

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,720
telegram boats on public telegram

142
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,039
channels for example of synthe espanol

143
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,240
or

144
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,039
specific russian or synth channels such

145
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,000
as competitive intelligence news or how

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to find channel there are other social

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
media platforms such as twitter reddit

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,080
discord linkedin

149
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,240
where you can find telegram

150
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,199
both by specific keywords

151
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,319
then we have

152
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,400
telegram resources centers such as

153
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,639
telegram channels that me where we can

154
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,639
specifically look for both

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,479
we have uh aston telegram ocean which

156
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,199
is a compiler of different

157
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,120
telegram resources

158
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,680
github resources or

159
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,639
telegram boards and

160
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,560
other kind of resources for all synth

161
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,479
purposes

162
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,800
we also have

163
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,360
botoxstore.com where we can find

164
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,440
different different telegram boards

165
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
moving on

166
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,319
very important before you know uh before

167
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,639
conducting any ascent of operation

168
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,080
uh is to

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,880
average telegram boats i here i provided

170
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
a couple of indicators

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,560
of how to

172
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,440
vet

173
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,120
uh and verify you know uh mostly uh

174
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,639
telegram both

175
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,120
so first you have to look for

176
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,800
a public channel which is attached to

177
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,520
the telegram board

178
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,080
then the second indicator is to look for

179
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,319
historical digital footprint for example

180
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,000
for a public domain

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,479
on google or for a github repository

182
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,479
we can also

183
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,960
look at the transparency of the telegram

184
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,440
votes channel and username for example

185
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,160
if

186
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
we can find um

187
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,479
the domain uh displayed on the

188
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,520
on the telegram about or

189
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,599
username or channel

190
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,599
then we can look across telegram

191
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,720
channels and private

192
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
groups for reviews and feedback related

193
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
to the telegram

194
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
and we can also

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
look for the number of projects

196
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,479
developed and maintained by

197
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,960
the creators of telegram boats

198
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,199
there is another indicator for example

199
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,759
to look for transparency of payment

200
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,039
processors

201
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,240
um

202
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,560
so for example uh we can look for the

203
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,080
crypto address uh cryptocurrency address

204
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,000
uh we can look for credit debit cards

205
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
and other well you know payment methods

206
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,520
and we can test uh of course telegram

207
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
boats with

208
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,639
soft puppets for for different outputs

209
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
i provided an example on the right hand

210
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,120
side for you know

211
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,360
one telegram bot which is a telegram

212
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,320
search engine mother search which is um

213
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,000
about it is

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
is free and

215
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,360
conventional uh telegram board to search

216
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,240
for different keywords and will display

217
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,040
it will display um telegram channels and

218
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
private links for example

219
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,480
and you can see here that we have found

220
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,240
the user um info the user and info about

221
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,760
uh

222
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,160
you know the creator of telegram balls

223
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
and other other projects

224
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,160
developed by this one

225
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,279
all right

226
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,080
uh very important when you know

227
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
conducting the

228
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,360
austin operations

229
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,279
is um

230
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,279
operation security

231
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,040
so on this uh

232
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,200
slide i will focus on a couple of

233
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,760
principles which are important uh when

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,120
conducting the

235
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,160
telegram you know all scene

236
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,839
first is to use a page vpn and

237
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,480
different virtual machines to change the

238
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,959
telegram privacy and security settings

239
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
so for example we can

240
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,680
set up uh different settings such as

241
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
you know

242
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
to block

243
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,640
the phone number to block the last scene

244
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,959
an online

245
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,399
profile photos calls and other specific

246
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
settings

247
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
uh we can of course use uh sock puppet

248
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
accounts um

249
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,399
uh also recommended is to use this

250
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
burner smartphone

251
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,399
disposable email and phone numbers

252
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,040
as well as disposable payment processors

253
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,560
because

254
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,279
there are uh you know

255
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,600
telegram both that require

256
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
payment

257
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,399
in order to function

258
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,200
because i will show you immediately

259
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,680
we are going to focus on country

260
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,959
specific telegram boats and for example

261
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,480
in russia in ukraine in iran

262
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,800
we will need to

263
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,600
pay for some uh telegram votes in order

264
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,880
to use uh them and to

265
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,320
gather data about targets

266
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,440
so

267
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,519
here it comes uh

268
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,640
one important thing uh to consider is

269
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,880
the jury prediction where you operate

270
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,640
and to understand the country's specific

271
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,760
landscape

272
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,640
so

273
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,839
you have

274
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,320
you know different uh

275
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,480
set of questions when you are doing all

276
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
scenes in russia for example

277
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,399
uh and especially when it comes to

278
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,120
payment because right now you know visa

279
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,839
and mastercard uh don't work in rush

280
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,600
anymore but

281
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,160
don't worry there are other ways to

282
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,360
uh root payment to kazakhstan or other

283
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,320
you know neighboring countries so you

284
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,160
have to understand the legal aspects uh

285
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,600
you have to understand the the barriers

286
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,000
of uh conducting oxyintine in different

287
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,320
territories all right

288
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,040
um there are three ways of using

289
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,519
telegram for all singed research

290
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,320
so

291
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,880
the first one is uh telegram using

292
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,120
telegram desktop app

293
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
uh the

294
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,959
second one is using uh the mobile phone

295
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,519
and you can use an android emulator or a

296
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,480
wireless screen mirroring app

297
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,639
such as jenny mobile for example resview

298
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,360
and the third one is by using a

299
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,839
web version of telegram and i'm going to

300
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,000
show you in my live demo all right the

301
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,800
last aspect here to consider is uh

302
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,920
punchly

303
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,399
so we need evidence we we need to

304
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,680
capture evidence and and to archive data

305
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,040
so we have to we can use huntley

306
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,360
on the desktop and also on uh mobile

307
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
all right

308
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,240
so

309
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,800
why telegram boards why we cannot do all

310
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,200
sim from browser or from you know github

311
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,680
why why we need telegram both

312
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,720
well

313
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,760
if we are you know

314
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,160
approaching from a western perspective

315
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,200
then we can find data like in open

316
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,079
databases using you know simply the

317
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,279
browser or github repositories github

318
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,639
tools and it's much easier but when it

319
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,399
comes to country specifically in iran in

320
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,440
kazakhstan in russia in ukraine or other

321
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,279
territories turkey

322
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,240
india

323
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,440
we have to

324
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
rely on you know different tools to

325
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,519
gather data we don't have um the same

326
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,480
level of access to data and there is

327
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,279
also the language barrier so we may not

328
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,920
speak russian arabic version or other

329
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,360
languages

330
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,959
all right

331
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,000
so

332
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,120
you can organize for example telegram

333
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,519
boats

334
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,880
you know by country or you can

335
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,040
of course

336
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,560
see some comparing comparisons between

337
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,720
different tools on the right hand side

338
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
here

339
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,959
where i uh exemplified you know

340
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,000
different

341
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,360
um

342
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,279
comparisons between

343
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,160
uh

344
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,800
telegram both which is one of them here

345
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,440
is how to find both in terms of all

346
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,720
synth workflows and resources and other

347
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,120
tools out there such as auxin framework

348
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
multigo spiderfoot

349
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
intelligencex

350
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
and here is a comparisons by

351
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,279
the

352
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,480
data

353
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,839
supported

354
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,320
by each tool but of course there are

355
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,600
other comparisons out there such as

356
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,240
you know in terms of costs

357
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,240
in terms of speed in terms of um output

358
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,720
uh generated and quality

359
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,399
so um we have to be aware of these uh

360
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,240
you know

361
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,959
differences and or more more exactly

362
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,440
between strengths and weaknesses of

363
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,000
which or for them

364
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,399
now i'm going to focus on

365
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,320
the specifics

366
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,839
so i i will provide three examples for

367
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,519
each thought chapter

368
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,279
and i will start with personal

369
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,519
identifiable research

370
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,399
so

371
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,399
here you can find

372
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,279
three

373
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,240
uh kind of both one is

374
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
universal search boat which is a free

375
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,160
boat which and is developed by how to

376
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,600
find boats from russia

377
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,639
it's very comprehensive and

378
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
it provides different

379
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,839
sets of data

380
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,920
um about a target

381
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,360
the second one is uh dantes gates boat

382
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,000
which is made by quantico a company from

383
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,199
spain um and the language is of course

384
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,240
in spanish but it provides um

385
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
a large um

386
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,199
pool of data

387
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,759
and automates uh all synth

388
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,519
searches um

389
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,680
you know for

390
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,959
addresses phone number persons and

391
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,560
usernames

392
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
this can be used

393
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,279
it is a commercial board and can be used

394
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,320
by buying different uh tokens for

395
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,000
different searches for example for

396
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,160
nickname you buy a token or

397
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
a couple of tokens and you can dock you

398
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,480
can conduct searches

399
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,519
and

400
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,600
in terms of speed is is a really good

401
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,480
one because

402
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,839
you don't have to go to 10 pages of

403
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,680
google or other kind of uh tools to

404
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,560
search

405
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,759
them and scrape them for example you can

406
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,240
gather data

407
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
in a in a faster way by using this board

408
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
the third boat is open data ua bot which

409
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,920
is a boat from ukraine and in this uh

410
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,120
example here um i have searched for

411
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,199
the one of the former presidents of

412
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,680
ukraine victor yanukovych

413
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,360
which now is in uh in russia is and uh

414
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,199
he's on the interval list so

415
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,440
of all for most wanted you know often

416
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,760
yeah i'm also of wanted persons so um i

417
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,959
search for sanctions for court

418
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,599
both civil and criminal uh course

419
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,240
cases and of course you can find a lot

420
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,720
of details there

421
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
moving on

422
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,359
to stock mains

423
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,160
i have three examples of both here

424
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,720
one is find me now both which is a

425
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,840
social media search engine

426
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,000
comprehensive you can search by

427
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,640
a username and you can find the leak

428
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,080
data you can find uh different accounts

429
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,679
on different

430
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,840
social media platforms

431
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,640
magray uh auxinbot which is really known

432
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,360
in uh sim community which conducts a

433
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,960
username enumeration across uh 200 2000

434
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,840
plus social media platforms

435
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,000
and lastly sofa upboard which is

436
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,480
pretty similar to epos

437
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,720
developed in france and

438
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,760
polge

439
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,679
which conducts

440
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,080
enumeration by

441
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,520
email address and shows

442
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,320
different social media accounts

443
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,000
related to that email address

444
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,918
all right

445
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,320
i will discuss now about how to search

446
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,760
leaked data by different telegram boards

447
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,080
for example um

448
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,600
one of them is mailix boat which finds

449
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,000
leaked passwords by email address and

450
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,799
you have three free searches

451
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,440
so you can search for example um

452
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,320
for

453
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,559
an email address and we'll you know

454
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,880
reveal uh

455
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,000
different

456
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,559
databases and also

457
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,600
link-based

458
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,080
passwords but it's important for example

459
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,799
to see in which the databases

460
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,200
that email was contained and of course

461
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,160
you can

462
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,080
you know

463
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,440
be votes

464
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,280
on different databases and uh conduct

465
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
additional research

466
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,480
uh the second one is phone links boat

467
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,440
which founds uh in what leaks the phone

468
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,480
number appears which is really known in

469
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
russia

470
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,559
it searches over 150

471
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,120
databases in in russia and

472
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,320
former soviet states

473
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,320
and the last one is um data leaks both

474
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,480
uh you can find the name of phone number

475
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,120
password social media mentions and also

476
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,559
associated

477
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,679
locations via an email address

478
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,480
so these are very important both to to

479
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
you know find additional uh information

480
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,200
about your target and uh to pivot for um

481
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,320
you know uh finding um

482
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,240
and or expanding your oc investigations

483
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,760
the best time best boat so

484
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,799
there are

485
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,320
a couple of ways to monitor dark web

486
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,720
and especially now

487
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,600
when a lot of dark web vendors moved

488
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,480
to

489
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,320
telegram because

490
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,200
it's more easier you know to

491
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,120
communicate with your

492
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,039
dealers your with your you know

493
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,520
clients customers

494
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,400
and

495
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
um

496
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,240
there are a lot of data leaks there are

497
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,720
a lot of

498
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,799
malicious activity on telegram so

499
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,600
um i found uh two ways by which you can

500
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,559
monitor for example for

501
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,720
cyber threat intelligence uh malware or

502
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,039
you know if you want to do

503
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,520
monitoring for humanitarian crisis or

504
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,200
counterfeit selling

505
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,320
you can use these two boats so you can

506
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,120
identify rss feeds for example from

507
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,159
threat

508
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,600
dark web forum you can forward feeds to

509
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,640
aximobot and you can monitor for example

510
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,080
specific dart net markets and vendors

511
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,559
uh there is another boat

512
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,880
for you know monitoring

513
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,240
a set or a list of telegram public

514
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,640
channels and private groups

515
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
which is junction bot

516
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,480
so you just provide a list of

517
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,880
telegram public channels and private

518
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,640
groups or links

519
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,840
and

520
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,520
these bots will

521
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,240
aggregate all of them into one

522
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,679
thread or field

523
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,039
and last but not least

524
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,799
there are a couple of telegram balls to

525
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,000
conduct domain and ip investigations i

526
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
have provided here three of them

527
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,880
so one of them is who is bought the

528
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
second one is universal search bot which

529
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,000
i already mentioned and the last one is

530
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,799
who is domain both so you can come

531
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,679
perform um with records for a certain

532
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,039
domain or uh to perform uh

533
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,880
an ip lookup or a dns uh you know look

534
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,760
up

535
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,840
for a

536
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,559
domain

537
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,159
all right

538
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,880
so now comes

539
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,840
the

540
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,520
fun part

541
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,919
going to move quickly

542
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,640
to

543
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,320
my ubuntu

544
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,720
virtual machine

545
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,158
and

546
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
i'm going to show you

547
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,720
how you can use

548
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,440
paragraph

549
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,840
let me just pull it this on here

550
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
so what i have here

551
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
is i have

552
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,400
the web version of telegram and i have

553
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,840
how to find

554
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,400
both

555
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,520
so by this one which is a paid vote you

556
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,960
can perform

557
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,960
different type of searches for you know

558
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,400
different targets

559
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
in country specific uh

560
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,840
you know um

561
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,320
so let's let's let's look uh for example

562
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,000
for a phone number

563
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,240
and let's suppose we need

564
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,039
one of them in china or we need in

565
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,880
brazil so this one for example

566
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,760
gives you a couple of resources

567
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,760
to search for phone numbers in brazil

568
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,279
yes

569
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,840
give me a second

570
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,440
uh then we can

571
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,559
have a look

572
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,720
for example for an username

573
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,320
and we have

574
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,600
a list of awesome resources to look up

575
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,480
for

576
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,159
an username

577
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,490
we can select here for example

578
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,159
[Music]

579
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,960
one of the boats we can select

580
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,520
migrate

581
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,000
good

582
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,799
and

583
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,360
we can see here that this is a free one

584
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,400
and we can go to search for a

585
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
username

586
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,559
let's search for a dark web vendor

587
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,559
username

588
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,320
so it will take some time here

589
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,840
in the meantime

590
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,080
in the meantime we have another one

591
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,240
and we can search for

592
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,520
the same username

593
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,559
on

594
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,799
my grid

595
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,600
using both

596
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,799
let's see

597
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,320
so we have a telegram account and we

598
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,720
have um an instagram account here

599
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,400
for this one and on the other one we

600
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,640
have a report

601
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,240
and we have

602
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
one account on meter

603
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,559
and also on freelance code buy

604
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,559
and we can download of course the report

605
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,039
from here

606
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
so you can perform all things

607
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,559
investigations by using for example this

608
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,600
um

609
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,039
shield and

610
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,480
this is really

611
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,720
really nice because you can organize a

612
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,640
bunch of resources here and you can

613
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,919
search for example for company details

614
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,799
in uh specific countries for example

615
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,720
i'm looking now for company details in

616
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,720
china

617
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,919
go back a little company name

618
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,640
and we have for example here

619
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,000
let me just

620
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,360
see

621
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,240
we have four different details for

622
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,720
example court cases we have

623
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,760
this qcc.com

624
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,760
a very important resource in china for

625
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,400
investigating a company

626
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,520
so this provides a really nice uh

627
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,840
you know

628
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,240
a way to investigate targets

629
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,520
all right

630
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,320
and there is of course

631
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,200
i have here a list of uh

632
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,120
200 or to over 200 telegram votes which

633
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
are you know

634
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,000
organized by status free or free or

635
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,320
commercial we have notes about them we

636
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,919
have applicability in different

637
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:20,960
countries

638
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
if they are vetted and we have also

639
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,880
opsec we can for example uh

640
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,559
select them by applicability

641
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,559
and we can

642
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,240
use them for example in china in cuba in

643
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,279
iran

644
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,360
kazakhstan or different territories

645
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,399
uh this project will be released after

646
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,840
this conference so you can play with

647
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,360
this list of telegram both

648
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,080
all right

649
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,840
there is one another important thing

650
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,440
here that i wanted to show you quickly

651
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,720
and

652
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
this one is

653
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,720
um

654
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,919
a docker container because

655
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,600
in some investigation you will need to

656
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,679
access data

657
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,279
so

658
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,520
i will use this docker container which

659
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,840
is running um

660
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,360
for example uh within my uh within my

661
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,640
browser

662
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,159
um my local uh my local computer

663
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,000
so

664
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,240
you can see here uh the junction boat

665
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,960
i've already mentioned so to collect

666
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,880
different data leaks

667
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,799
um

668
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,840
this is a really nice one to organize

669
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,080
your um

670
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,360
your data

671
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,240
and of course you can

672
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,520
download this and have a look uh you

673
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,679
know for specific uh specific uh

674
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,520
data points

675
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,159
so i have here for example over 1 000

676
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,760
share links or 1000 files so i'm

677
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,240
collecting them from a list of

678
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,919
a list of databases or a list of um

679
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,880
telegram uh channels and

680
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,919
private

681
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,320
groups

682
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,679
uh they are here and if you want to

683
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,559
download them you can download them and

684
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,600
within this docker container so

685
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,720
uh it's like a sandbox and

686
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,799
if something is malicious

687
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,279
uh you will be protected and you can

688
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,000
sanitize them and after them export them

689
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,480
into your uh

690
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,559
you know vm

691
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,120
and of course this docker container is

692
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,799
really nice because

693
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,760
uh there are so many so many things here

694
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,039
you can switch between containers

695
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,039
uh if you want to go to signal if you

696
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,880
want to go to

697
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
um

698
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,000
to tor browser or a different uh browser

699
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,480
or you know virtual machine you can use

700
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,559
it with the you know docker container

701
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,520
here

702
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,279
which is uh

703
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,320
you can search for cousin workspaces

704
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,200
and

705
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,279
this will be deleted after after this

706
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,520
all right

707
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,360
uh

708
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,000
so i will close this presentation with

709
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,399
um some takeaways in future projects

710
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,039
first of all telegram is a key component

711
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,039
of uh country specific austin

712
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,840
investigations

713
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,320
very important is to understand the

714
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,879
telegram object so pay attention to

715
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,919
you know what you access on telegram pay

716
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,760
attention to the privacy and security

717
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,440
settings and other

718
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
important settings

719
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,840
also

720
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,279
one important thing is

721
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,279
you know to

722
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,080
understand the applicability of telegram

723
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,440
both to vet them to verify them before

724
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,559
before a deployment

725
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,120
some future projects

726
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,039
that you know i

727
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,799
have on my list

728
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,120
are you know to build specific uh

729
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,760
telegram modes for automating those in

730
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,399
workflows chartail or to specific

731
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,159
industries for example if you want to

732
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,519
focus on uh brand portrait protection or

733
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,919
content protection

734
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,679
or you want to focus on cyber trade

735
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,760
intelligence so

736
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,480
there are still still a lot of uh

737
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,600
ways to do that and

738
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,240
i see you know lots of opportunities

739
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,600
here

740
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,320
so as i said i will release uh the list

741
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,000
of uh awesome telegram boats and you can

742
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,200
you know play around it and

743
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,600
give it a try and also provide feedback

744
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,039
because uh

745
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,960
i want to improve the project

746
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,440
yeah thank you very much

747
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,559
i i will open now for questions

748
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,919
awesome

749
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:10,880
so

750
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,480
a little bit short on time for questions

751
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,640
but we have had one or two which are

752
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,000
quite interesting

753
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,880
uh so how do you specifically confirm

754
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,440
results from the bots uh indicate

755
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,799
in the context of an investigation

756
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,240
yeah

757
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,799
so of course you can use um at the same

758
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,000
time multigo with specific transforms

759
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,799
and you can use uh spider force with

760
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,320
specific apis integrated so

761
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,760
i have already tried this with specific

762
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,679
uh telegram boats

763
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,279
um in investigations and i have compared

764
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,320
you know

765
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,600
the outputs generated by telegram both

766
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,519
and montego

767
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,240
or spider food

768
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,320
so in terms of a specific

769
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,039
piece of intelligence that i needed in a

770
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,440
specific country for example russia or

771
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,799
iran

772
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,279
telegram boats are unique so they

773
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,440
generate specific data for these

774
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,480
countries

775
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,440
uh in comparison with you know

776
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,519
montego or spider food which are not

777
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,919
good for you know country specific uh

778
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,760
oceans

779
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,640
the moment at the moment

780
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,760
awesome

781
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,559
and i think we had another uh question

782
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,399
uh one of them is uh where exactly will

783
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,039
uh interested people be able to

784
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,919
find the list when it is released

785
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,679
um i will

786
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,960
share the list

787
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,679
