1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,759
okay hi there good morning everyone and

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,839
thanks nicos for the little introduction

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,120
there

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,320
okay so

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,719
um as you see the title of my talk is

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,880
the way forward with 2fa

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,279
and uh i'll give you a little bit of a

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,880
running order to show you what i'm going

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,720
to be doing

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
so there it is it says running order i'm

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
going to tell you a little bit about me

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,599
i'm going to tell you a little bit about

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,640
the acronyms that are in use and that we

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,719
sometimes hear

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,040
but i hope to tell you why we need to

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,920
use 2fa

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,360
i'll show you a few resources and

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,960
sources

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
i've got some takeaways and then

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,840
hopefully there might be some questions

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,640
so

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,960
without further ado i'll move on to a

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,000
little bit about me

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,840
there's money that's to remind me okay

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,760
so i'm mark giles

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
you might be thinking

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
who's the granddad here

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,039
well yeah i am grandad and i've got

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,640
four grandchildren they're all in their

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,159
teens

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,000
and i grew up in the 60s when the space

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,479
race was on and

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,799
i was born the same year as yuri gagarin

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,159
in actual fact

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,000
i was into robots remote control toys

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,640
electronics the sinclair spectrum the

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,840
zx81

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,880
incidentally uh today is the anniversary

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,280
of the spectrum 40 years ago today it

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
came out so that gives you some idea of

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,960
how old i am and what i was doing

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,880
i there need to do that

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,360
um

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,399
okay

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,200
yeah sorry about this guys

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
i uh wanted to also tell you that a bit

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,720
about my background uh i've started off

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,920
in banking

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,560
and then i did a career change after

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,640
about 10 or so years

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,399
and did a course in computing in the 90s

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,040
it was very early days then

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
and i thought to myself i want to work

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,120
in this sort of industry because i've

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,599
been doing the sinclairs and stuff so

56
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,560
then i got a job at bt so i did a bit of

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,959
computer operating and i did a bit of

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,000
training

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,879
and that was great fun then i did lots

60
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,680
of other little jobs and things but the

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,920
the computing was always beckoning me so

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,840
in about 2012 i set up my own little

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,319
business it was called computer coaching

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,480
at home and i just gave out lessons

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,560
and i thought bachelor there's more

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,640
demand for this there's actually no need

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,800
for some tech support so i changed the

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,840
name to

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,000
her for computer help instead of a

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,920
website here for computerhelp.co.uk

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,879
and that's where i am now but i'm

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,480
actually moving into other things

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,680
so

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,239
why

75
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,640
cybercybercity that's my my handle

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,480
well

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,800
cider city is the nickname that was

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
given to hereford

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,959
when cb radio was on

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,920
so

81
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,239
i took that and in front of it i put

82
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,879
cyber because hereford's got its own

83
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,159
cyber quarter or cyber center so it all

84
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,239
just sort of tied in so that's my my

85
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,440
little name

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
and i started to

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,319
get into cyber security in a very loose

88
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,400
way about two years ago first during the

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,159
first government

90
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,760
so that's why i'm here and that's why

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,080
my names are as shown

92
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,720
okay so that's enough about me i hope

93
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,440
uh here's a little acronym buster that i

94
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,720
put together

95
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,599
um

96
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,640
part of the problem is there are so many

97
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,959
terms aren't there so it's no wonder

98
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,159
there's confusion in all this

99
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,519
um

100
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,879
so sfa single factor authentication

101
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,519
that's your box standard username and

102
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,799
password

103
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159
it's just not enough anymore

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,239
we just they're just being cracked and

105
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,799
they're being hacked and uh

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,880
it's too easy to break so

107
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,478
we then have a term called two f a two

108
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,720
factor authentication

109
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,000
that basically means exactly two factors

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
for authentication

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,919
and 2fa

112
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
is a subset of

113
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,960
mfa which is

114
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,199
multi-factor authentication so 2fa can

115
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,560
be

116
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,320
if tofa is a multi-factor authentication

117
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,199
but mfa usually means more than two so

118
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,840
it'd be two plus another one most likely

119
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,759
but unfortunately they do get changed

120
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,000
around quite a lot but they can mean

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
different things i'll cover that a bit

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,120
later on

123
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
and we've also got a thing called

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
one-time password

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
uh otp

126
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
you get those sometimes when you click

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,800
on a link in an email and it gets you

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
through

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
2sv

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,560
stands for two-step verification again

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,080
it get used a lot interchangeably with

132
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,479
mfa2fa

133
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,720
i'm not too i will cover the semantics

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,600
on that a bit later on but it's main

135
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,919
thing is to understand that they they

136
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,840
can mean the same things but we do need

137
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,919
to do something more than the single

138
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,240
factor authentication which is username

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,680
and password

140
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
you'll hear me talk about the uh ncsc

141
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,960
the national cyber security center

142
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
and i just put in the cisa that's in

143
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
this case cyber security and

144
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,280
infrastructure security agency because i

145
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,199
took a little bit of something from

146
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,280
their site

147
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,520
okay

148
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,039
so why

149
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,320
two factor authentication well as i just

150
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,520
said um passwords alone are just not

151
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,639
enough

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,039
we keep hearing about compromises data

153
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,199
breaches people using passwords reusing

154
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,479
passwords people sharing passwords

155
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,160
and in fact the ncsc

156
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,319
remember who i said they were

157
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,919
the they say that two-step verification

158
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,360
often shortened to sv provides a way of

159
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
double checking

160
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
that you really are the person you're

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
claiming to be when you're using online

162
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,280
services such as banking email social

163
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,560
media

164
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,400
it's available on most of the major

165
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,360
online services and they go on to say

166
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,080
two-step verification is also known as

167
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,720
two-factor authentication and

168
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,039
multi-factor authentication so there you

169
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,840
are straight from uh ncsc they're saying

170
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
you you know we're using all those terms

171
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,240
interchangeably

172
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,280
adding

173
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,120
two-factor authentication is something

174
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
that can be done easily well i hope to

175
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,039
show you that this is something you

176
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,319
really can do very easily

177
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,880
and any two-step verification is going

178
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,960
to be better than not having anything at

179
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,199
all it's a bit like think of an onion uh

180
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,599
the layers of an onion and as you open

181
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,840
those layers the harder it is to get

182
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
into the side order so you you're

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,479
protecting yourself with lettuce

184
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
okay

185
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,639
so

186
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,199
let's talk about the factors that we

187
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,199
have so

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,560
when we look at 2fa we're looking at two

189
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
factors of authentication which could be

190
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,199
something you know

191
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,240
or something you have sorry so something

192
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,440
you know and something you have eg your

193
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
smartphone

194
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,759
and then mfa multi-factor authentication

195
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,199
is two or more factors and this brings

196
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,240
in another layer which would be

197
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
something that you know i.e the password

198
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
that's called the knowledge factor

199
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
something that you have

200
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,479
that's the possession factor such as

201
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,919
your smartphone

202
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,280
and the third one which is really

203
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
interesting is something that you are

204
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,800
which is a biometric such as a

205
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,080
fingerprint

206
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,120
and that's sometimes called the

207
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,319
inherence factor

208
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,080
so what's the difference between mfa

209
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,120
and two-factor authentication

210
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,879
well

211
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,319
the ncsc says that two sep step

212
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,479
verification provides a way of double

213
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,639
checking that you really are the person

214
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,200
you are claiming to be

215
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,080
mfa will actually

216
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,159
[Music]

217
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,599
i've gone on there do apologize

218
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,399
mfast is two or more basically

219
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,200
so

220
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
when you set up

221
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
i say we're trying to contact two-factor

222
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,959
authentication when we set up 2sv

223
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,720
the second step

224
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
is something along the lines of a text

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,480
message or something that's created by

226
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
an app and that's what i wanted to to

227
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
talk about today

228
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,160
um the app that i like to use is called

229
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,040
google authenticator

230
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
so let's have a look

231
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,360
there no i haven't okay

232
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
so

233
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,640
when you go to

234
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,839
your various

235
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,519
when you go to your various apps such as

236
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,040
google play and ios for apple so google

237
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,440
play runs the android store and app

238
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,080
store runs the ios store you just search

239
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,120
for google authenticator

240
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
and you can they've installed on either

241
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,640
of those devices

242
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
and you go ahead

243
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,480
and follow the instruction it really is

244
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,920
simple to do it what this app does it

245
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
creates a unique

246
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,720
six digit time time-based code

247
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
for you every time you decide to log

248
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,279
into one of your accounts so the

249
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,880
procedure is

250
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,399
you

251
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,480
add the app to it and you verify

252
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,320
yourself with google

253
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,040
and then you visit the sites that you

254
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
wish to add

255
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,760
to

256
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,720
facto authentication to and as you do

257
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,760
that

258
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,480
the there will be a handshake that is

259
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
where your mobile device talks to the

260
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,279
server authenticators

261
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,880
and it will

262
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
immediately

263
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,200
code your phone so that it will generate

264
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
the unique codes for you in the future

265
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,040
so this is actually all tied in with

266
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
that particular phone

267
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,200
and then once you've got that going the

268
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,760
next time that you try to log in from

269
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,720
you know a non-stand non-usual device

270
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,200
you'll be prompted to go to your google

271
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
authenticator

272
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,959
and supply a code so you'll get your

273
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,560
little mobile phone out

274
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
and you'll

275
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,160
go to google authenticator

276
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,399
you'll look up the account that you wish

277
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,200
to log into and there will be a code a

278
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,959
unique six digit code that only lasts

279
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,240
about 30 seconds and at that moment you

280
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,120
put that code into the account that

281
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,200
you're trying to sign into

282
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
and if you get it right

283
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
you're in

284
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
so

285
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,399
there are others as well

286
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,360
we i'd like to use google authenticator

287
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,519
but microsoft does one as well

288
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,360
microsoft's got quite a good one as well

289
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,279
i haven't used that but either are

290
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,200
available okay

291
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,279
so move on to a little bit more

292
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,000
i realized that um

293
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
what i've just done there is it's a

294
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,120
little bit of a brisk introduction to it

295
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,440
but what i'm trying to get across is

296
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,040
that the simplicity of setting up one

297
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,519
method of additional logging in is going

298
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,160
to be better than nothing

299
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,279
ah

300
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,959
when when i talk about better than

301
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,440
nothing we probably all get these sms

302
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
codes come through from uh various

303
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,639
places

304
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,959
uh it's an sms or a voice code it's

305
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,880
better than nothing but it's it's easily

306
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,560
broken into so

307
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,399
the alternative

308
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,560
is to get the the push codes that

309
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,279
actually get sent by apple that happens

310
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,480
particularly

311
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,360
when you log into your apple id you'll

312
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
notice you'll get a generated code that

313
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
comes through says are you trying to

314
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,720
sign in and it's got to happen there and

315
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,639
then you'll get a code on your

316
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,079
mobile mobile or other apple device

317
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,680
you'll also have probably seen google

318
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,720
prompts

319
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,360
sent to your mobile device etc

320
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,279
now even better is what we were just

321
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,920
talking about the google authenticator

322
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,880
app

323
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
and say microsoft does one as well now

324
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,360
something i haven't touched on

325
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,240
yet

326
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,839
is the hardware keys so

327
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,160
you may have heard of these little

328
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,240
things they're called um one of the one

329
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,480
of the branded ones is uh yubikeys i

330
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,360
believe they're operated by ubicon

331
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,200
the idea

332
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,959
is that

333
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,560
they add an extra layer of security

334
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000
and they help to protect against

335
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,959
automated bops and targeted attacks

336
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,720
and efficient resistance too so it's

337
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,480
actually a piece of hardware like a

338
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,959
little usb memory stick you stick it

339
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,480
into your device

340
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
and you press a button and it will

341
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
immediately give you the authorization

342
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,839
through that various manufacturers

343
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,079
hundreds of apps and online that they

344
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,320
work with they're not hard to use but

345
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,200
i'm that's going to be my next um

346
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,040
journey into this field let's i'm not

347
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,959
going to get myself one of these little

348
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,240
ubicorn keys and see how they go

349
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,560
the texts and the authentication apps up

350
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
above don't offer quite as much

351
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,160
protection

352
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,079
but what i'm trying to stress is that we

353
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,279
need to set something up better than

354
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,199
just your username and password

355
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,240
okay

356
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
so

357
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,880
um

358
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,240
i've put some links here into a

359
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
slideshow but we'll make the show the

360
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,839
slides available uh then i will do that

361
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,760
nick will probably work that out with me

362
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
there's a really good link there that

363
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,480
ncs have provided to tell you exactly

364
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,279
how to go through with it and what to do

365
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,720
it's easier to follow one of these

366
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,639
things from the people that know what

367
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,040
they're doing

368
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,519
uh you can install google authenticator

369
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,399
on ios with that link or on android with

370
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,560
that one

371
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,399
uh yeah there's not that i was talking

372
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,720
about the 2fa the 2sv

373
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,079
there's a little link there that tells

374
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,920
you about they do go into quite a bit of

375
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,440
discussion about two-factor

376
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
authentication two

377
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,839
step verification

378
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,600
there are ways that people interpret

379
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,720
things differently you say you might

380
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
mean one thing the main thing is let's

381
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,240
get people doing something in addition

382
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,839
to just

383
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,880
uh using their username it's just not

384
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,360
good enough anymore i hope that

385
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,800
all of you will now take away from this

386
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,399
that it's really important

387
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,519
to use another form of identification

388
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,399
verification authentication

389
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,240
on your key sites let's start with your

390
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000
email start with your email account

391
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,320
that's what i did first and then i added

392
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
my bank accounts and then the social

393
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,199
media because social media is a very

394
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,480
common

395
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,199
threat vector if that's the right word

396
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,199
to come in and attack someone

397
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,399
i do highly recommend the ncsc site

398
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,160
that's the first link there

399
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
go to that link or just google

400
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
ncsc.gov.uk

401
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,399
other search engines are available of

402
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,720
course

403
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,759
little abc little abc thanks thanks to

404
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,800
nikos uh for giving me the chance uh to

405
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,040
suggesting that i might like to talk and

406
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,800
i've also spoken to him a lot in the

407
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,360
past and he did a radio interview for me

408
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,800
as well

409
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
uh thanks to winery steeper who was on

410
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,199
just now uh one before i came into the

411
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,800
meeting he's given me some little tips

412
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,399
along the way

413
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,680
and to james coffee fueled uh

414
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
i was gonna have a session with him but

415
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,000
things i couldn't find the time myself

416
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,320
i've been very busy working but he gave

417
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,720
me a lot of information

418
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,240
in a very short time and in a really

419
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
good way to understand so big thanks to

420
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,399
james

421
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,199
okay

422
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,120
i'm gonna leave you with a little

423
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,519
thought

424
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,839
that's my my thought for you

425
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,759
prove it's you

426
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,199
with two

427
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,519
okay prove it to you with two so you've

428
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,279
got the two steps that quote comes from

429
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
the cisa

430
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,120
site that we're telling you telling you

431
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
about and i thought that's really good

432
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,639
and the graphic actually comes from the

433
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,680
ncsc but i thought let's do two things

434
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,399
and you know you'll be doing a lot to

435
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,920
help your online security

436
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,680
and that's about it folks so thank you

437
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,759
very much

438
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,279
if you do have any questions by all

439
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,360
means let's see if i see if i can work

440
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,400
it

441
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,119
yep we do have a few questions for you

442
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,039
uh the first problem is from skelly so

443
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,240
i'll take you take it away

444
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
thanks nicos

445
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,400
uh yeah so my question is once i open up

446
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,280
the twitch chat to find it

447
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,720
um

448
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,919
alrighty

449
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
so question for you mark is there any

450
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,839
way to bypass to a fair multi-factor

451
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,280
authentication is it possible to have

452
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,880
your account hacked even with it enabled

453
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,280
you know that's a good question

454
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,520
i don't know

455
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
um

456
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,360
it depends but what immediately springs

457
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,600
to mind is that

458
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,120
you may have also had other sections of

459
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,760
authentication set up and so of course

460
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,160
if it's if there are others that have

461
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,200
been set up for that account then that

462
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,480
way could allow someone in via that

463
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,720
route rather than the uh

464
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,559
normal way i maybe

465
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,240
may need to check it further on to that

466
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,080
but then that's not that's not really a

467
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,400
very good answer i do realize that but

468
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,240
my aim is to try these using the the two

469
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,679
two factor is to stop the drive-bys to

470
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,120
stop the the multi-people really trying

471
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,480
seriously to

472
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,600
get in

473
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,679
uh credential stuffing that's the thing

474
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,280
using frequently used passwords and

475
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,440
stuff like that and this is

476
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,760
this isn't sort of um what should we say

477
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,840
cia fbi mi5 level we're just saying look

478
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,320
let's stop the bulk of attacks with just

479
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,679
one more step

480
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,520
if you're needing more protection then

481
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,640
we're probably going to need to look

482
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,559
into it a bit more

483
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,320
makes sense thank you for that answer it

484
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
goes you want to take the next question

485
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,440
yeah a small question from ray uh

486
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,039
starting with a statement uh one of the

487
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,080
biggest controversies in uh infosec

488
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,200
is about

489
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
sms being used for mfa uh you've cited

490
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,160
this a little bit earlier um we all know

491
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,039
how

492
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,799
insecure it is but uh is sms

493
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,760
mfa too many acronyms uh better than no

494
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,480
mfa at all uh specifically for people

495
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
that are um

496
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,320
let's say more at risk let's say

497
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,679
grandparents uh you know the the more uh

498
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,320
technologically susceptible uh

499
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,799
people out there

500
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,720
yeah most definitely really good point

501
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,559
um thank you for raising it yeah most

502
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,440
definitely you anything that you can do

503
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,520
that puts another

504
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,480
block another wall between you and

505
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,799
somebody or some bad actor somebody

506
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,280
trying to get in is gonna be good yeah

507
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,000
by all means nothing wrong with an sms

508
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,120
text um we could say that there are ways

509
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,640
obviously this weighs around a lot of

510
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
these things but

511
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,160
it's gonna help it's gonna help it's

512
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,520
another layer

513
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,000
username password is just literally not

514
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,160
enough so yeah use an sms text

515
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,760
verification by all means

516
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,559
um so liz went commented uh quickly that

517
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,520
um

518
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,400
that you could get hacked if you in the

519
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,000
period of the renewal of your 2fa code

520
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,840
uh send the code to someone else or if

521
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,480
you like send the sms you know that you

522
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,120
received to another person uh i think

523
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
that's been used a lot in scams

524
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,840
uh

525
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,960
is there

526
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
do you think there's ways to detect

527
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,000
these types of scams

528
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
um when you know

529
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,039
like how would you

530
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,039
uh advise someone to avoid these kinds

531
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,520
of scams

532
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
yeah that's that's

533
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,120
that's tricky i would say the more

534
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
methods that you have

535
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,960
is going to be the better

536
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,919
you don't give the codes to anyone else

537
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,159
i mean that's pretty obvious i would say

538
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,880
don't share your uh codes to somebody

539
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,360
else and don't uh

540
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,039
you know you'll get these people phoning

541
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,200
you up and say oh can you just do that

542
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,039
don't trust anyone the first thing is

543
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,120
you've got to do is take

544
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,480
take five and say no this sounds

545
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,039
dodgy if it sounds dodgy it probably is

546
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,840
dodgy so just stop and think

547
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
it's really just about we've got to do a

548
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,440
lot more to protect ourselves i reckon

549
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,520
definitely

550
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,559
do i take the last question

551
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,960
you mute it

552
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,039
i'm really good at technology i promise

553
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,600
all right uh last question

554
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,039
is let me check

555
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,400
uh would you recommend considering

556
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
usability of mfa implementation as a

557
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,559
criteria and whether or not to adopt it

558
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,400
and which to adopt how would you weigh

559
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,679
that against the security posture

560
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,320
improvement

561
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,200
wow

562
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,960
can you consult can you read it again

563
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
again a little bit i can

564
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,280
yeah sure i'll slow down

565
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,240
okay

566
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,840
would you recommend considering

567
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,559
usability for an mfa implementation as a

568
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,200
criteria and whether to adopt it and

569
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
which to adopt and how would you weigh

570
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,960
that against the security posture

571
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,280
improvement from copy field

572
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,240
um

573
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,640
yeah i mean usability is obviously going

574
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
to be crucial you i mean we've had

575
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,159
enough difficulty having we're getting

576
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,400
people to use stronger passwords and not

577
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,640
reusing passwords so yeah to get anyone

578
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,720
to adopt something in addition to that

579
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,480
is going to be hard so usability is

580
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,240
going to be key

581
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,520
i said key there i mean maybe we need to

582
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,000
think let's move on to the hardware keys

583
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
and let's let's use those if that's

584
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
possible because there is a charge

585
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,320
the advantage of the

586
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
yeah the advantage of the application

587
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,799
the applications the apps is that

588
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,400
they're free to use

589
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,120
and they're pretty easy to get people to

590
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,240
adopt

591
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,640
the keys there is a charge involved but

592
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,440
they are possibly um

593
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,960
maybe harder and they may not suit

594
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,400
everyone to have to wander around with a

595
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,280
key

596
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,480
so yeah it's certainly going to be

597
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,880
important to think of the usability but

598
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,200
let's what i'm trying to do is sew the c

599
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,960
and if we could all go away from this

600
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
and so that seed in our

601
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
relatives friends groups you know are

602
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,120
you using

603
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,360
2sv 2fa

604
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
get people talking about it and then the

605
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,520
more of us to start to use it then

606
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,639
hopefully it get adopted

607
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,960
i i have a hardware key for my password

608
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,720
manager and as i was setting up this

609
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,960
computer for uh the

610
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,360
event i was like hm i need to access my

611
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,679
password manager from like this computer

612
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,360
do you have your hardware key

613
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,159
uh do i

614
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,679
so yeah

615
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,640
it is

616
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
yeah usually you carry around your phone

617
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,720
right but like an additional pair of

618
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,080
bits and bobs

619
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,559
that's yeah

620
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,000
it's another thing isn't it yeah with

621
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,400
the keys would would be probably good i

622
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,559
mean again the practice guys i haven't

623
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,440
seen how strong or robust they are

624
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,799
that's uh it's something you have to

625
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,559
look into

626
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,640
by the way if um what people if you if

627
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,200
you do are using an authenticator

628
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,159
uh you do need to print out um your

629
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,760
backup codes

630
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,159
because if you lost your phone uh it

631
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,080
would be important to

632
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,799
have some other way of getting back into

633
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,840
your account otherwise you're gonna be

634
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
locked out i've got a little slide on

635
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,400
that there it is it's um there's a link

636
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,640
there and you know you do need to have a

637
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,120
copy of your backup codes in case

638
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
you do lose your phone but it's all

639
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,400
about getting us a second layer getting

640
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,919
a second layer into your security is

641
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,480
going to be key

642
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,400
what

643
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,840
um i don't see any more questions so

644
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,960
yeah

645
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,279
thanks uh mark for joining

646
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,279
thank you thank you nicos thank you eden

647
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,880
cheers of course cheers take care
