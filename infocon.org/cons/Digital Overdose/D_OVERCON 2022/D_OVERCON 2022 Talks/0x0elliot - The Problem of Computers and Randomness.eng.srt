1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,759
hi everyone i am

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,879
oxford

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,400
and today i'm here to talk about the

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,200
problem of computers and randomness

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,880
um so a little bit about myself

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,560
a little bit about myself

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,279
i am a software developer and a security

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,880
enthusiast

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,400
um

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,880
i am currently pursuing my b tech in csc

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,560
from bennett university

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,160
i like to make and contribute to open

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
source software in my free time and i am

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,558
not really an expert on this topic of

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,239
randomness it's something that requires

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,079
phds and phds but i just happened to

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,920
walk into a couple of nerds speaking

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,800
about randomness and that's how that's

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,559
how this park started and that's how i

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,640
started researching on it and that's

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,960
that's me thanks atomic for putting that

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,559
as the official picture

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,960
um anyways

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,719
so here is the problem statement

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,640
computers are deterministic machines

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,600
okay

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,399
so

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,600
if you

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,879
want your computer to add one with one

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
it will give you two right

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960
it's efficient at doing exactly what you

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,439
asked it to do but at the same time it

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,439
it's not smart enough to come up with

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,880
things on its own but then how the heck

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
are we able to generate otps randomly on

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,560
when we require it or cryptographic keys

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,600
when we require it so such such this is

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,159
what i want to address in this talk

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,079
about how we move forward

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,600
um

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
for reference uh the spoiler spoiler

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,159
heard a little bit about about a lot of

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,000
things that are going to come i want you

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,680
to think of

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,840
of the of coming up with randomness with

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,159
respect to a function

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,240
um a mathematical function itself

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,040
so let me lay down some ground rules

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
first of all we're going to use python

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
for reference because it's easy to read

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,759
and everyone in the security community

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,439
must have used python that one place or

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,839
the other

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,439
the other

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,880
ground rule that i want to lay down is

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,038
that when i say random here i don't

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,360
really mean random random it's actually

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
pseudo-randomness because whenever it

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
comes to computers you cannot actually

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,080
come up with pure randomness right

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,690
um

62
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,160
[Music]

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,760
well if you think about it nothing is

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,640
truly random but let's not go there

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,160
um so

66
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
the talk is more about pseudo randomness

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,120
rather than randomness

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
um yeah so let's begin finding a

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,760
solution to the problem that i laid down

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,720
um

71
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,319
i would have wanted you guys to pull out

72
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,760
your terminals if you guys were in front

73
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,560
of me

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
but really think about it how would you

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,120
come up with one function

76
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
which would output a

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,319
random number every time you run it it's

78
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,080
a it's a great question that would spark

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000
your curiosity in this topic

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,040
um

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,280
to the panel uh

82
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,159
do you guys have any guesses

83
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,720
make make light guesses okay

84
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,040
i mean if i was going to put something

85
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
random oh

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,959
we all know the correct way of doing it

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,879
let's let's try to find a way that's a

88
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,560
little bit more creative

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
um

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
i don't know um

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,120
the

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,519
power drainage from a cpu

93
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,319
like

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,319
a cpu is going to do a various number of

95
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,920
operations per

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,159
second

97
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,319
that's a good idea that's a good idea

98
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,000
good

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,959
number of threads or power drainage or

100
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,720
uh things like that

101
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
that could be interesting

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,799
um

103
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,319
what else

104
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,840
the problem is that it's uh it's not a

105
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
compound value right so you're going to

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
get something in a range that is

107
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,040
somewhat predictable depending on

108
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,040
i don't know um even you have any ideas

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
okay

110
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,599
so sorry

111
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,599
it's fine it's fine

112
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,599
um we're talking about something random

113
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,560
that

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
i don't know yeah i have to remember to

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
unmute my mic sometimes so i'm sorry if

116
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,200
there's a delay in what i'm speaking but

117
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,439
something random

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,519
um

119
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,200
no i've got nothing

120
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
i was actually just about to to whip out

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,918
um my code editor and see if i can

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,759
generate something without using a

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,520
pre-written function

124
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
so i'll get back to you in chat when i

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,400
when i finish up

126
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,720
okay we we've had one person suggest

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
something

128
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
uh so observing a physical phenom

129
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,160
phenomenon

130
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,479
so for example using a camera that would

131
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,960
detect if something is happening or not

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,720
that could be an idea

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,960
that's a good idea i totally forgot how

134
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,650
smart the invisible community was

135
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,160
[Laughter]

136
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,759
these are really good ideas i never

137
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,040
thought of them

138
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,160
anyways

139
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
these are really good suggestions um

140
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,120
somewhat true uh i wait

141
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,000
well

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,320
we'll get there we'll get get to how

143
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
it's done as atomic said

144
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
the correct way

145
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,120
um but

146
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,039
let's start from the start okay i want

147
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,520
to uh since i was talking about the

148
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
since i was talking about how python how

149
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,919
it happens in some python libraries

150
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,840
let's start from the start so i want to

151
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,000
use the reference of the random module

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
you guys must have used the random

153
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,199
module somewhere right

154
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,280
it doesn't really give you again it's

155
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
that the name is a bit misleading there

156
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
is it's it doesn't generate something

157
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,960
random it generates something

158
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
pseudo-random

159
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,479
so um here is how the random module does

160
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,039
okay so the random module uses the

161
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,199
current unix timestamp

162
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,479
as the seed to generate the output the

163
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,919
random numbers right so um it's actually

164
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
when i found out about it initially i

165
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
thought it was pretty smart but at the

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,479
same time i i wasn't satisfied by it

167
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,440
because come on it sounds a bit weak

168
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,919
somewhere right

169
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,630
so um

170
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,240
[Music]

171
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
fair enough so it uses the unix

172
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,880
timestamp to seed the random generator

173
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,479
and then it accordingly produces the

174
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,680
random numbers

175
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,000
um

176
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,240
so i want to talk more about how it does

177
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,639
work right like give you some brief

178
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,000
some a brief abstract of how things work

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
in in in the random module so it uses a

180
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
an implementation of an algorithm called

181
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
the mercen questo so the mercy investor

182
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,919
is supposed to generate random numbers

183
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,919
it's a prng which sounds for which

184
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,840
stands for a pseudo random number

185
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
generator

186
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,360
and it it it is able to generate a

187
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,919
sequence of random numbers

188
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,919
uh when a seed is given to it from the

189
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,440
seed itself and the seed of course in

190
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,160
this case is the by default if you don't

191
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,240
see it you you have an option to seat it

192
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
but if you don't then by default it uses

193
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
that unix timestamp and uh

194
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,639
that seed from that seed it generates a

195
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,479
sequence of random numbers

196
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,360
these random numbers um the catch here

197
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,160
is

198
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,319
that uh even though the algorithm is

199
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,160
pretty pretty tough

200
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,039
uh

201
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,120
the thing is that these random numbers

202
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,960
would eventually start to repeat itself

203
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,319
after a point

204
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,039
that you generate from the seed okay

205
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,960
and for one given seed uh the random

206
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,240
number the sequence of random numbers

207
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,800
generated are the same

208
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,880
so if you gave this information to

209
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
someone who is really into cryptographic

210
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
they'll probably have a heart attack and

211
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
because of that uh

212
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,520
because of that you must have heard

213
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,360
people say that okay don't use the

214
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,919
random module for for things which are

215
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,479
cryptographically sensitive right you

216
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,000
must have heard them ask you to

217
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,639
specifically use the secrets module now

218
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,639
the secrets module is another library

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,720
provided by python uh you can check

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,039
check out its code base from c python's

221
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,879
official github repository

222
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,919
um

223
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,440
which

224
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
is able to uh

225
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,199
which is able to generate the random

226
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,520
numbers according to itself

227
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,479
which is able to generate

228
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,639
cryptographically secure random numbers

229
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,120
so uh pseudorandom numbers so it's a csp

230
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
rng

231
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,840
but then the question arises what is so

232
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,639
different about the secrets module right

233
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,879
i mean it was already pretty smart for

234
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,319
the random audio

235
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,360
to

236
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
to come up with random numbers on its

237
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,680
own

238
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,599
but then how does the secrets module

239
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,160
come up with with these random numbers

240
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
now again i didn't give you time because

241
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,360
i think i've put the answer somewhere in

242
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,680
the slide itself okay i haven't that's

243
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,120
nice

244
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,080
um

245
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,479
so the secrets module

246
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,360
uh it uses i won't go into the depth of

247
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
how it happens uh but i scrolled through

248
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,919
the the code base

249
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,680
all i would say that it actually uses a

250
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,160
class from the random module itself

251
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,000
which is called the system random module

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
the system random clash

253
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,839
uh this the secret module uses this

254
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,080
class and this class is responsible for

255
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,720
fetching the entropy from your opera

256
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,640
from your operating system

257
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
now

258
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
how your operating system comes up with

259
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
these with with the with the entropy is

260
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
something that depends on the um

261
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
operating system we're talking about if

262
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,160
we're talking about unix systems then

263
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,480
it's of course slash dev slash random if

264
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
we're talking about uh windows then it's

265
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,920
it's it's probably some win32 api right

266
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,519
um

267
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,600
for for the purposes of finishing up

268
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,640
this talk i want to look into this uh i

269
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,120
want to look into slash dev slash random

270
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,160
um

271
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,839
because i'm more comfortable with unix

272
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,720
systems and i as far as as far as i've

273
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,880
understood when the windows also does

274
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,279
the same thing more or less

275
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,600
so it fetches the entropy

276
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,080
from slash dev slash run

277
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,279
fair enough

278
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,080
uh

279
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,279
but how does slash dev slash you random

280
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,600
a file in in your linux system well it's

281
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,080
not a file it's a device but

282
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,320
continuing uh a file in your linux

283
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,120
system come up with a random numbers

284
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,959
sorry random bytes

285
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,640
you get it right how does it come up

286
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
with this entropy

287
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
um

288
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,959
again the answer is in front of you

289
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,959
because i'm putting in this slide

290
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,399
but uh

291
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,399
it's still interesting to think about it

292
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,279
right

293
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,120
um

294
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,560
since the answer is already in front of

295
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,600
you i'll i'll i'll brief up more on that

296
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,399
it uses entropy that is generated by a

297
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,640
system and this system and then and this

298
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,160
entropy is

299
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,040
generated by the in so basically every

300
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,880
time you move your mouse

301
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,120
every time you use your keyboard every

302
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,519
time a drive is red uh all these

303
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,959
functions they take different amount of

304
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,519
time right i think someone in the chat

305
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,600
also said that we can use some physical

306
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,480
hardware

307
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,519
but more or less

308
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,240
it happens here more or less it's it's

309
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,000
not as smart as you were talking about

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,279
but more restless there is something

311
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,120
like that which happens here and uh

312
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,399
um all this uh because of the of the

313
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,200
random entropy uh because of of of the

314
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
factors involved here we are able to uh

315
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,800
use this information to as a seed and

316
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,360
then we are able to uh to to generate an

317
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,399
entropy pool

318
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,680
which is then

319
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,240
further used for for the secrets module

320
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
right

321
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,880
so that's

322
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800
pretty much all i wanted to talk about

323
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,519
here

324
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,240
but still before i end this talk i know

325
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,399
this was short but before i end this

326
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,560
talk i all i want to i all i want to

327
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
leave you with

328
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
is the fact that

329
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,480
to mimic the most basic of things

330
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,399
something like coming up with random

331
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,680
numbers

332
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
which which you can do on your own at

333
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
the top of your head

334
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,200
uh to mimic the most basic of things we

335
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
had to come up with algorithms

336
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,200
smart algorithms and we had to

337
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,959
understand we had to come up with

338
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,760
creative ways to to get to get entropy

339
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,880
to get to to get to get to get the seats

340
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,079
for our for our csp rngs for our prngs

341
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,279
um

342
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,720
just to make the most basic of things

343
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,760
which is which is coming up with

344
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,360
something random on your own

345
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,079
so it's it's almost beautiful how how it

346
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,639
all comes together and how we try to

347
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,720
do these things

348
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120
that's that's mostly it i think my talk

349
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,480
i i did

350
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,720
i think i've covered most of it if if

351
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
you guys have any questions and answers

352
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
i'm open to them

353
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,200
um but again as i said i'm no i'm no

354
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,160
expert

355
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,639
i am just someone who loved who was very

356
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,560
curious about this topic and thought you

357
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,000
know what i'm going to give my first

358
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,399
talk and it's going to be avoid this one

359
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,120
topic that i loved starting up on

360
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,320
so go ahead ask me questions

361
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,079
no we have no problem

362
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,000
we've had a few suggestions uh in the

363
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
meantime uh one which is a bit recursive

364
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,160
but uh we'll get to that um

365
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
right observing a physical phenomenon

366
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,920
such as a coin flip so using a robot to

367
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,320
flip a coin and then observing uh the

368
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,399
the coin flip

369
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,320
okay but you cannot do that with me

370
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,800
dude that that's a good suggestion

371
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,880
but uh usually

372
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
your computers and your mobile phones

373
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,350
don't come with coin flippers

374
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,760
[Laughter]

375
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,600
it's all about getting creative

376
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,880
theoretically if i were to build one

377
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,959
would that uh would that work

378
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,240
i don't know i think you've just

379
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,440
inspired my next project

380
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
um okay

381
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,240
we've uh

382
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
right are

383
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,839
our coin flips truly random uh i don't

384
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,480
know um someone suggested a kind of

385
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
recursive approach uh using a random

386
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,600
sample of a random number

387
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,920
which is like hmm

388
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,880
okay

389
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,399
it's like the chicken and the egg

390
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,560
but you what the random number has to

391
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,518
exist first right

392
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,680
true um

393
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,399
and i had an actual question uh

394
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,920
less than a suggestion but you mentioned

395
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,360
devue random

396
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,839
and would a less powerful computer let's

397
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
say a raspberry pi

398
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,959
or something on a very small device such

399
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:15,760
as

400
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,519
an esp32 which runs a very uh

401
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,279
lightweight version of linux such as

402
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,760
what we can see in the iot world

403
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,120
uh have a slower generation of entropy

404
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,600
uh than let's say and

405
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,519
i don't know an ibm z

406
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,480
uh

407
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,680
uh mainframe

408
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,240
like is there a difference in speed

409
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,560
dude there must be but legit i don't

410
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,480
know

411
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,880
that's fine

412
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,120
that's yeah that's

413
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,639
that's that's the question that's like

414
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,560
hmm could you could you if you knew the

415
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
device

416
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,800
be able to then generate a slice of

417
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,040
random uh like of you know the entropy

418
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,920
values and then attack based on that

419
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,399
that seems that seems kind of impossible

420
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,800
i don't know man uh it's a good question

421
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,560
that i might have to look into myself as

422
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,320
i said i it's just something that i've

423
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,480
started up on my own for the for the for

424
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
the sake of

425
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,839
for the sake of fulfilling my curiosity

426
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,680
but that's a good question i don't think

427
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,360
it should be possible but

428
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,839
since something like a

429
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,199
raspberry pi

430
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,150
doesn't have these other physical

431
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,519
[Music]

432
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,440
well i think i think i think it should

433
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,839
be

434
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,519
well it's something that i have to study

435
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,600
up on my own and i think it should i i

436
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,399
think it should be safe enough

437
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,120
yeah

438
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,800
i mean it's uh

439
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
to have the idea of actually going ahead

440
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,600
and like enumerating debut random to

441
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,639
then do very like micro second specific

442
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,480
attacks sounds a little bit overkill

443
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,880
in the voice revolution

444
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,880
random

445
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,680
interesting topic

446
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,160
indeed

447
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,440
yeah and thank you so much for

448
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,959
presenting it for us honestly i think

449
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,399
that's gotten a lot of people thinking a

450
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
lot of brains going inspired to new

451
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,680
projects

452
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,639
um

453
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,240
is there anything else you'd like to add

454
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,720
elliott or nicos

455
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,759
um

456
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,279
not really

457
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,519
nothing else you guys can follow me on

458
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,480
my socials it's everywhere any you can

459

find me anywhere with with my username

460
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,720
being 0x00 elliot

461
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,399
other than that i would like to thank my

462
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,480
friends who are just sitting right there

463
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,320
in front of me

464
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,320
wait
