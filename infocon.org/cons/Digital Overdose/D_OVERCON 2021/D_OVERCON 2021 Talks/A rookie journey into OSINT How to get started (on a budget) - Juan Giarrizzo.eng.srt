it's a personal experience uh but also i

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,000
want to share

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
some lessons learned and how to get

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,480
started

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,680
and this amazing world that is awesome

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,079
so i wanted to talk a little bit about

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,920
me beforehand

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,040
i had a background in bioinformatics

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,239
i spent a lot time doing consulting for

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,239
life sciences and pharma

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,000
and currently i'm informatics program

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,800
manager at children's hospital

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
this is my twitter handle if you want to

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,840
look me up

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,920
and i started in austin a little bit

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
over a year ago

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,879
and uh for many many reasons my path has

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,079
changed so i started

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,640
trying to find missing people and now i

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,000
find myself

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,680
supporting criminal investigations and

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,240
prosecution of high-level crimes

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,560
internationally

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
so uh for today i wanted to

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,439
think uh how to to to summarize what

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,040
we're going to do together

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
and i put it in the in the structure the

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,680
findings on an awesome report so finally

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
this is part of the awesome report that

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,040
you probably will end up

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,280
building at some point in your career

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,640
and these are the three finders

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,320
findings that i want to share with you

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,240
today so the first one is you can

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
get great awesome education from open

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,920
sources

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,880
either cheap or free the second one is

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,119
the

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,640
there are building blocks for an

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,320
investigation that are very important

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,479
such as the objective the methodology

51
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,680
and the tools and the third one is that

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
there's a basic setup that you need to

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,079
understand and build before you start an

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,040
investigation

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,439
right so your puppets your puppet

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,399
accounts

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,119
your machine and also the objectives of

58
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,040
the methodology of the investigation

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,000
so let's start step by step building

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,560
this

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
this story so when we talk about open

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,440
source intelligence

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,840
we all kind of know that this is the

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,680
finding of information on intel

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,840
in sources that are available on the on

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,280
the web

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,319
we don't do any um active

68
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,280
uh hacking or we don't penetrate any

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,360
systems to get this intelligence

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,000
so we're trying to grab the the crumbs

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,800
that

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
our target has left in the web but when

73
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,640
we talk about

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,920
awesome we we definitely have a lot of

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
things to think about it so

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
we can be speaking about people awesome

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,920
we can talk about corporate awesome

78
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,040
websites

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,879
defensive async and offensive awesome so

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,000
there's a few of the angles of the

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
investigation and the framework that you

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
can take

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
but you also can change your angle base

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,879
of what you're trying to do

85
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,519
so are we trying to find missing people

86
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,080
are we trying to do some fact checking

87
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,040
are we trying to define any threats

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,159
against our organization or systems

89
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,159
i was supporting criminal investigations

90
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,280
and so forth

91
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,560
so the idea of this lie and i know i'm

92
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,480
missing some points is that

93
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,599
you when you start your journey might

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,000
may think that you want to do austin for

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,319
a reason but that probably will change

96
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,640
as long as you learn more about about

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,360
the

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,920
framework and techniques so i for

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,400
example

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,640
started trying to find missing people

101
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,760
and then i end up

102
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,599
supporting some criminal investigations

103
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,599
and the more you learn

104
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,519
the more you learn about yourself and

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,159
then you will land in the place that you

106
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,319
enjoy and you feel that you're making a

107
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
difference to the world

108
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
so today we're gonna do two labels

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,920
we're gonna use two labels in our

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,680
presentation we're gonna talk about the

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
steps to take

112
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,760
to find the content and set up yourself

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,480
to become

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,360
a junior austin investigator and some

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,080
advice

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,879
but i am not a cocky person so i don't

117
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,279
want to say that i'm giving you advice

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,720
i give advice from me to present

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,080
present me to newbie me so if i were to

120
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,199
talk to

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,400
myself some time ago i will tell

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,759
this advice all right so

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,720
the first step follow the awesome crowd

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,440
in twitter

125
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,919
this is something that has helped me a

126
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,280
lot

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,520
is there's nothing as easy to go to the

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
advanced search

129
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,759
uh the twitter search and look for

130
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,560
keywords

131
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
we could try um awesome as a keyword

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,000
but i usually use follow friday or ff

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
and then you will see all the amazing

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
people that you can

135
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
and organizations that you can follow

136
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,680
these are some of my favorite

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
of course trace labs if you don't know

138
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
them please get to know them

139
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,639
uh they do an amazing job awesome dojo

140
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,800
i when i started in this career this

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,080
path i i

142
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
learned a lot from them they're very

143
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,080
generous and of course

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,400
some of these people that you may know

145
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,320
including the amazing bellingcat

146
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,280
if you are into building beautiful

147
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,880
reports i suggest you to

148
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
for you to check them out the idea here

149
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,880
is you find the voices and then you

150
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,400
start learning the language and you

151
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,680
start seeing

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
what tools are coming out and what is

153
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,479
what people are talking about

154
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,840
another note here is this is a good

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
first contact with their with the

156
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
community so

157
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
it's a good idea to follow these people

158
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,000
reach out to them

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,120
ask questions and you we you will found

160
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,039
you will find out that they're amazingly

161
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,280
generous

162
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,880
listen to some podcasts you i i learned

163
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,680
also a lot by just walking my dog and

164
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,039
listening to some podcast

165
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,240
uh we we all learn different ways um

166
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,280
the audio way for me is very useful

167
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,000
these are some of my favorites i added

168
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,319
the darkness diaries there because

169
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,280
when we are starting in the infosec

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,479
arena

171
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,600
telling and hearing a good story about

172
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,319
use cases or about an awesome

173
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,600
investigation

174
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,240
what can go wrong it's a good way to

175
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,919
understand some concepts and

176
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,520
and and also learn um techniques

177
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,199
and and you know some do's and don't

178
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,800
don'ts and in the industry

179
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,880
let's start for looking for free or good

180
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,840
price training

181
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,039
i could speak for hours

182
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
of what operators you can use in google

183
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,160
to find

184
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
free training but i just put some of the

185
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,960
ones i have used in the past

186
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,560
event write has some amazing web

187
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,880
webinars about awesome that you can find

188
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,400
if you look for free

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,880
awesome or awesome webinars in

190
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,080
eventbrite

191
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,280
youtube i have found good

192
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,039
tutorials but to be fairly honest we are

193
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,840
open source investigators go to a search

194
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,720
engine

195
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,120
look for free awesome and you will find

196
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,280
really really good content

197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,400
sans institute has a link

198
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,160
of preferred free sources i don't

199
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,440
think it has been updated recently but

200
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,560
it's a good start please just use your

201
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,919
open source intelligence

202
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,479
hack and find for everything that is

203
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,120
free

204
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
because you know what you're going to

205
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,199
get a lot of good things

206
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,720
especially if you're starting your

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,120
journey

208
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,560
some good trainings that i i have done

209
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,240
and i recommend so udemy

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,639
has really good um has several

211
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,919
trainings in it that you can find just

212
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,520
look for the open source intelligence

213
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,680
topic and i personally love

214
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,720
the awesome combined um training because

215
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,560
they start with something that i believe

216
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
sometimes we overlook which is the

217
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,560
methodology and the

218
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,759
intelligence cycle so

219
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,039
we we tend to look forward to

220
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,599
learning how to hack by running commands

221
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,680
or learning how to find information

222
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,800
with specific tools but sometimes in

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,879
austin we overlook or we go

224
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,759
past the methodology and the reasons of

225
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
why you're doing something and that's

226
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,360
very important so awesome combined does

227
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,399
a great job

228
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,839
and giving you a good framework about

229
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,880
awesome

230
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,719
at the end find a course that feels good

231
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,720
for you and introduces you to the

232
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,279
framework and i will suggest try not to

233
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,160
spend too much money at the beginning so

234
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,200
there's uh

235
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,760
there are so some good courses that can

236
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,160
cost less than 50 or 30 dollars

237
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,080
and really really will give you a good

238
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,279
framework to start with

239
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,480
this the fourth step we're continuing

240
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,279
our journey

241
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,640
so a tools library so this is

242
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,680
basically a collection of tools that you

243
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,160
will

244
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,000
get through your exploration of twitter

245
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
your webinars uh youtube

246
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
all of this will give you a good sense

247
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,080
of tools and and these are basically

248
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,720
either software or or programs or

249
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,640
scripts that you can use for a specific

250
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,600
reason

251
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,519
the important thing here is to create a

252
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,680
collection it has to be organized so

253
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,320
i have this particular technique which i

254
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
will i will share with you

255
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,399
you search in an open source for a

256
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,600
particular tool

257
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,480
of let's say i'm trying to find how to

258
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,120
extract

259
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
exif data from pictures

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,360
in bulk so i grab that then i

261
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
email it to myself uh because i don't

262
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,360
want it to be lost in a

263
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,560
in a in in in a document pasted or so

264
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,160
i label that in the email i use gmail

265
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,200
labels i have a awesim label

266
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,519
in my gmail account that one i use for

267
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,640
this purpose

268
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,120
and then i add it to the collection so i

269
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,279
have a running onenote

270
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,920
that has all the tools that i need for

271
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,959
specific

272
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,760
objectives if you can see here uh if i'm

273
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,120
doing people or synth

274
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,560
i have how i have a collection of tools

275
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,959
to find both voter records phone numbers

276
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,160
etc

277
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,079
so what i want you to say with this

278
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,760
what i want you to do or what i want you

279
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,120
to understand with this

280
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
slide is that you need to have your

281
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
tools organized in a way that you

282
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
when you have an objective you can go

283
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,800
exactly

284
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,079
to the right tool for it

285
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,399
trials are great we we have

286
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,959
several products and several platforms

287
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,160
that have

288
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,800
trials for you to use the platform for

289
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,360
the

290
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,560
first time huntley for example is very

291
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
generous it gives you 30 days of free

292
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,519
trial

293
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,760
for those that don't know hunchley is a

294
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,200
great way to

295
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
collect information from a website and

296
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,040
even generate a report at the end

297
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,320
and it's it's uh it's

298
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,399
it's free you can get used to it it

299
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,360
teaches you

300
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,200
how to extract information how to build

301
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,600
a report showdown

302
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,720
they recently had a um

303
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
a promotion that will they will give

304
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,480
giving lifetime membership for four

305
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,519
dollars

306
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
to celebrate the four years anniversary

307
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,600
that give you 100 prayer credits

308
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
and 100 scan credits uh in

309
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,200
16 ip addresses that can be monitored

310
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,279
and scope now for example has a seven

311
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,480
day trial

312
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,120
so what i'm trying to say there are

313
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,720
trials that you you should

314
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
exploit to learn the tools and by

315
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,880
learning these tools

316
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,519
you will be learn also how to do

317
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,880
investigations

318
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,399
now the caveat here is that you use

319
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,480
you should start the trial when you have

320
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
read about the tool

321
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,800
and you have a good use case for it

322
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,839
meaning

323
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,240
just don't try the don't do just don't

324
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,760
do a light read

325
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,720
on the tool and then go and trial

326
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,000
because you know what you're gonna get

327
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,480
bored

328
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,279
after two days you didn't had a use for

329
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:25,680
it

330
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,279
and that's true you didn't have a real

331
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,120
use case for it but if you have a use

332
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
case and you have

333
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,399
read about the tool beforehand

334
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,880
you can connect those two things and

335
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,519
then

336
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,639
you can exploit that free trial at

337
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,720
you know the the best way

338
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,000
now here's the first advice of the day

339
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,399
so

340
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,240
tools are great but they're nothing

341
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,760
without methodology

342
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
and this is something that i i want to

343
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
go back in time and tell myself

344
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,399
i collected a lot of tools and when i

345
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,360
started my first

346
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,720
investigations i spent probably

347
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,959
almost 10 days trying to figure out how

348
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,760
to do things

349
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,600
or what i was looking for so

350
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,360
these three questions are very good to

351
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
start to ask

352
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,200
at the beginning of your investigation

353
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,959
so you have to define what are the

354
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,360
objectives of the investigation

355
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
what workflow are you going to follow to

356
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,519
fulfill those investigations

357
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,440
and what kind of rapport are you going

358
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,800
to generate so

359
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
here is something that it's interesting

360
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,320
i i recently was involved in

361
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,519
investigation

362
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,720
and i the lawyer that

363
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,040
contacted me say listen i just need you

364
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,079
to

365
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,399
find if these pictures were taken in

366
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,160
this place at this time

367
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,120
and i started thinking okay we can also

368
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,360
uh you know find persons of interest we

369
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,839
can

370
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,959
we can try to put maps on and they they

371
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:53,920
were very

372
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,839
very strongly uh firm saying that's not

373
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,120
what i need

374
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,440
the case needs this and this is what you

375
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,519
need to find so you see the workflow now

376
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,639
is narrows

377
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,199
and then your objectives are very clear

378
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,000
and then your

379
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,639
your tools are also very well defined

380
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,279
so think about the report that you are

381
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,639
being asked to

382
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,000
to provide and that will set you off for

383
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
success

384
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,880
let's continue with what are the

385
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
investigation objectives right so

386
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
if you're finding a missing person

387
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,360
you're going to go after a specific set

388
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,160
of of information if you're analyzing

389
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,360
evidence of a crime

390
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,480
you're also trying to find a different

391
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,920
set of information and you're going to

392
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,399
find

393
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,079
and you're going to use a different set

394
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,519
of tools so

395
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,560
here we're going this slide

396
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
has the purpose of reminding you that

397
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,920
the objectives will define your workflow

398
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,160
and the workflow will define the tools

399
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,199
right so

400
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,639
if you think of about this

401
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,440
you have to keep in mind that if you

402
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
don't define this at the beginning of an

403
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,320
investigation

404
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
you are going to spend a lot of time and

405
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320
waste a lot of time

406
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,360
trying to figure out how to get where

407
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,160
you want to go

408
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,440
and i like to think about the essential

409
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,880
unit of intelligence so

410
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,199
and this is particularly useful if you

411
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,399
decide to do

412
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,040
any ctf so the essential unit of

413
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,079
intelligence

414
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,120
for me is the minimal expression

415
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,839
of the intelligence gathering so the

416
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,199
awesome section

417
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,600
is what you are going to put in the

418
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,639
reports is

419
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,959
where what i did to find this

420
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:39,839
intelligent was

421
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,160
this the links obviously because we need

422
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,839
to provide the support of the

423
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,759
intelligence that you found

424
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,639
pictures of screenshots or your findings

425
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,560
and the notes and the notes are

426
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,680
really the explanation of

427
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,560
what what you found is relevant for the

428
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,759
investigation

429
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,000
and why it's important for us to look at

430
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,800
this intel

431
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,000
all right so these four elements will

432
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,279
set you up for success because you start

433
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,279
thinking while you're doing your ctf or

434
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,959
when you're doing investigation

435
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,440
i did this i arrived here and it's

436
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,199
important because of this

437
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,480
and that is how you can start threading

438
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,639
a story about your target

439
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,040
and then you can start presenting a good

440
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,759
case

441
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,639
to whatever you are going to present it

442
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,800
step six you must create a report

443
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,440
template

444
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
and i want to say everybody has a

445
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
different flavor of reports i don't want

446
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,440
to tell you what your report should look

447
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,079
like

448
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,279
i want to share with you what my reports

449
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,000
where my report starts and sometimes i

450
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,639
modify

451
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,680
based on clients or based on objectives

452
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,399
so

453
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,120
the first thing you should do is have an

454
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,480
introduction

455
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
what was the event or events that we're

456
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,839
investigating

457
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,000
what is known so far and what is the

458
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,480
context okay so you need to understand

459
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,319
what happened or and what led to that

460
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,199
event

461
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,079
and in that way you can tell that

462
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,839
whoever is reading that report

463
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,039
this matters and this is why

464
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,439
the second is your findings remember

465
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,760
what we started this presentation

466
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,959
we had bullet points well the findings

467
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,000
is what you find during your

468
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,319
investigation presented really at the

469
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,919
beginning of the report

470
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,679
i found this this is why how i found it

471
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,480
and this is how i can i verified it was

472
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,360
true

473
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,240
okay and that can be hinted with a

474
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,039
conclusion

475
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,919
so this leads me to conclude that this

476
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,720
or that

477
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,160
happen okay uh

478
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,799
then you move to your intelligence so

479
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,400
the intelligence

480
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,320
section for me is when you really um

481
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,600
brush up your your writer skills and you

482
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,880
tell the story

483
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,760
the pictures the links the data you're

484
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,160
you're

485
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
walking through a a facts

486
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,520
you're walking through a forest of facts

487
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,760
and you want to draw the reader

488
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,240
into the details that you found it's a

489
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,080
beautiful it's a beautiful part because

490
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,039
you are

491
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,080
you're it's like if you you can have to

492
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,120
imagine being behind the person reading

493
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,240
the report and telling look closer look

494
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,360
this this means that this person was

495
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
sitting here when this

496
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,320
this was uh happening and that for me

497
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,520
it's it's amazing and it's beautiful

498
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,600
and as i said at the beginning if you

499
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
want to read really good reports i

500
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,200
suggest you you go to the bellingcat

501
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,000
website and look at some of their cases

502
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,320
they

503
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,399
are nicely nicely written

504
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,840
all right we're coming to the setup

505
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,559
hardware and software so this is a tough

506
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,080
one because people

507
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,439
always wants to get

508
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,799
faster machines big machines

509
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,559
what do i install in my machine and so

510
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,880
forth let's talk about the

511
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,440
awesome computer the first thing that i

512
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,200
want to remind you is that if you're

513
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,919
going to do

514
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,919
awesome you should have a dedicated

515
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,120
computer

516
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,919
yep it's that's true you should not use

517
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,520
your personal computer to do

518
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,960
awesome this is to avoid what we call

519
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,600
digital attribution and avoid that you

520
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,840
get recognized by any of your target

521
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
especially if you are looking into uh

522
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,880
dangerous

523
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,400
people i don't want you to tell that you

524
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,240
should go out and buy a brand new

525
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,280
computer

526
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,400
uh a refurbished computer can do it you

527
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,760
can get a macbook pro

528
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,080
from 2015 for 580 bucks in back market

529
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,000
chromebooks are pretty decent you can

530
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,280
install ubuntu

531
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,799
um which is a linux distro in it

532
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,919
they range from 229 for 849

533
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,039
in the chromebook shop or find a

534
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,559
computer that nobody has use

535
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,360
is using in your in your family wipe it

536
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:05,760
off

537
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,799
install uh os on it and use it

538
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,039
i personally run a 2011

539
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,840
macbook pro and it runs fantastically i

540
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,960
have

541
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,960
ubuntu 2004 on it and it does the job

542
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,440
i i have that and then i have a personal

543
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,919
computer

544
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,080
the awesome machine is the virtual

545
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,520
machines that you're going to use

546
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,880
for your investigation so ideally

547
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,159
you well not ideally you have to have

548
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,280
a machine that is your principal machine

549
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,559
and then you clone that for each

550
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,120
investigation okay so basically

551
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,440
you are going to have a dedicated

552
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,679
environment for a specific investigation

553
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,720
why very simple you don't want to run

554
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,520
the risk that you have personal files

555
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,240
or you have another investigation files

556
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,760
in that machine in case

557
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
the court asks you for to you for you to

558
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,600
provide that machine

559
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,480
evidence i suggest if you don't want to

560
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,159
go to the pain of building your virtual

561
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,559
machine go to the trace labs

562
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,600
awesome vm the awesome vm of trace lap

563
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,399
it's based on the very famous um

564
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,480
vm and they have done an amazing

565
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,440
job curating it they recently released

566
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,720
their 2021

567
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,000
version and it's very well done you also

568
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,760
can build your own

569
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,039
machine if you are familiar with michael

570
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,679
basil's

571
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,360
uh book he has a great chapter about it

572
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,159
um in and it will it really walks you

573
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,240
through how to do it

574
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,480
this depends a lot of how comfortable

575
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,320
you are technically and

576
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,080
to be fairly honest there's not right or

577
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,520
wrong if you're starting

578
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
in your path in austin

579
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,520
when you uh move forward in this path

580
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,120
you will realize that you might find

581
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,960
yourself with a mixers you can have

582
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,600
pre-built

583
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,840
vms and you can have your own um

584
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,159
principal vm that you have built at your

585
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,200
liking

586
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
okay and each one of them will have

587
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,400
different

588
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,120
flavors and different levels of fitness

589
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,679
for what

590
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,720
your purposes are

591
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,400
so let's continue with burner funds yes

592
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
you will need at least one i will

593
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
suggest you get one

594
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
why because when you're setting your

595
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,880
puppet

596
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,520
accounts you want to use a phone that is

597
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,200
not linked to you

598
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
it has to be factory unlocked so you

599
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
don't get bound

600
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,000
to any provider ebay is a

601
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,280
great source of of

602
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,000
factory unlocked phones there are some

603
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,960
electronics

604
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,240
shops that sell refurbished cell phones

605
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,159
so use and refurbish are your friends

606
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,760
means the sims card from me are

607
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,000
in my opinion the best price value you

608
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,200
can try

609
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,320
setting this up with a

610
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,039
99 cents intro package that they have in

611
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,919
amazon

612
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,960
the link is right there but you should

613
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,840
be able to

614
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,880
find a decent um

615
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,240
burner phone that can be that you can

616
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,039
use for swap

617
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,960
seams for 150 dollars i want also to say

618
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,360
that before you do this you have you

619
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,480
should check

620
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
if you're going to use mint if the phone

621
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,280
that you the model that you want to use

622
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,880
is compatible and the after you have

623
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,080
done that check

624
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,840
you go ahead and buy it okay

625
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
vpn let's talk about digital attribution

626
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,520
so digital attribution is

627
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,720
when you touch somebody's systems or you

628
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,279
look into somebody's social media

629
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,320
if they find a trace of you being the

630
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,600
person doing it

631
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,679
they will track you back and they will

632
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,360
identify you and that's something that

633
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,840
we want to avoid so

634
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,600
you can use a vpn which is a

635
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
something that you can easily install as

636
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,720
a software i

637
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,080
personally use the pia or private

638
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,720
internet access vpn

639
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,240
i found is enough for what i do

640
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,520
but if this person these people are

641
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,840
very very adamant in finding you they

642
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
can try to find

643
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,559
listed ips and track you back so i

644
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,640
combine proxy chaining

645
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,919
which is basically the chaining of uh

646
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,600
proxy servers through your um

647
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
through your computer so what you're

648
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,520
doing you're routing the traffic to

649
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,880
different servers uh from your linux

650
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,440
machine

651
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,120
i have dropped here a links from linux

652
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,919
vape

653
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,559
which is uh will show you how to do it

654
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,200
for your

655
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,400
um ubuntu dristro but

656
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,480
they have really good articles on how to

657
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,000
do it what i'm trying to

658
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,880
say please don't forget when you are

659
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,760
doing this

660
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,679
that the first thing that you have to

661
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,279
take care of is your own

662
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,559
safety it will depend of who you are uh

663
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,200
looking into but for certain

664
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
investigations i personally been

665
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,120
involved

666
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,039
i definitely don't want them to know

667
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,159
that i'm looking into

668
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,880
their systems or into their social pages

669
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,039
so you're ready i i had my

670
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,159
my tools i know i have my vm so

671
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,120
this is when i go back to my old my

672
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,159
younger self

673
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,440
and say remember preparation goes a long

674
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,960
way

675
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,799
you need to set yourself up for success

676
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,360
and you need to prepare yourself before

677
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,400
your investigation

678
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,600
that means create sock puppets these

679
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,960
accounts are the ones that you're going

680
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,080
to use try to

681
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,640
tune them to the region and the target

682
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
you're going after

683
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,240
upgrade your machine you don't want to

684
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
be end up having to upgrade your machine

685
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,000
in the middle of an investigation

686
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,520
or even worse a ctf clone

687
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,760
your vm before your investigation

688
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,159
remember you don't have you have to use

689
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,799
a vm for each investigation you don't

690
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,360
want them

691
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,440
you don't want to use your primary if

692
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,200
you use your primary you lost it you

693
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,480
have to

694
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,440
start from scratch get file structure

695
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,320
ready

696
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,559
including your reporting plan if you're

697
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,880
going to generate a report

698
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,279
this should be the the beginning of your

699
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,480
setup remember

700
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,000
you want to have in your mind

701
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,320
what is the story that you are going to

702
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,039
tell

703
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,200
and how you're going to tell it so that

704
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,039
way when you are in the middle of the

705
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,080
investigation you know exactly

706
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,640
what tools to use and how to tell the

707
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,320
story and then

708
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,120
therefore define your objectives and

709
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,919
discussed

710
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,919
with the investigation team if you are

711
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,679
collaborating with somebody

712
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,080
please listen to them you need to

713
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,320
understand what are the objectives from

714
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,960
the court what are the objectives for

715
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,360
for

716
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,960
for the for the organization so

717
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,919
we can be creative but we do really need

718
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,440
to satisfy those objectives

719
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,240
and of course don't forget the vpn i i

720
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,039
say this

721
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,799
and i will set it i imagine me screaming

722
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,799
a floating head screaming don't forget

723
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,799
the vpn because i have seen

724
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,399
uh many times people that has touched

725
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,760
when they were trying to investigate

726
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,120
without vpn and that becomes a problem

727
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,399
okay so remember we want to be safe we

728
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,760
we want to um enjoy what we do and

729
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,840
digital attribution is relevant

730
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,960
and the last advice and it's being

731
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,000
aware of your mental health um austin

732
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
will take you to different paths

733
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,120
um and that means that you might end up

734
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,679
seeing things or learning things that

735
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,880
are shocking

736
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,159
that are if that's the path

737
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,480
that you're going to they're shocking

738
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,440
and and they are

739
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,679
scary and and and you realize that

740
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,760
reality is not as

741
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,640
nice as you think you start dwelling

742
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,559
into a sub world

743
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,880
and you need really really need to be

744
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,760
aware

745
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,720
of signs and do don't be afraid to ask

746
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,360
for help

747
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,480
and i speaking here specifically to

748
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,360
people

749
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,200
that has mbas or there are some

750
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,240
clearance or they're involved on certain

751
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,679
intelligence work

752
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,520
that they can discuss where they're

753
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,840
working on with other people so you can

754
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,600
go for beers with friends

755
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,679
and unleash listen i've been looking to

756
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,720
these uh

757
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,000
pictures for the last 15 days i'm unable

758
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,120
to sleep i think

759
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,399
so if you are in that position please

760
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,240
be aware that that's happening and ask

761
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,919
for help because

762
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,360
there's nothing more important than your

763
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,320
own health and that also will tailor

764
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,159
what kind of investigations you want to

765
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,640
do right so if you find yourself that

766
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,919
you're

767
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,200
let's say you're a parent and you can't

768
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,080
by investigating missing children you're

769
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,720
losing

770
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,559
sleep you're you're angry you're afraid

771
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,279
then maybe it's a good sign for even

772
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,640
pivot which is a great

773
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,919
uh work word in austin to a different

774
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,360
line of investigation

775
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,399
or to seek for the help to understand

776
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,440
how to carry on okay

777
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,480

austin it's an amazing path and i think

783
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,880
it's the beginning of a lot of careers

784
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,000
in infosec

785
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,039

hi hi um uh

788
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,640
so a second

789
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,799
okay yes

790
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,559
there we go um so we we do have a few

791
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,360
questions for you

792
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,279
that have come in from the chat yes

793
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,799
um so the the first one uh

794
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,960
was related to your slides uh do you

795
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,080
think you'll be releasing them

796
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,559
uh maybe on a github maybe on something

797
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,320
i definitely will release them

798
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,760
i i need to find i probably will use a

799
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,559
link

800
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,360
or something safe to release them maybe

801
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,240
through the

802
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,720
conference right i will be then linking

803
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,799
this in the description of course

804
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,960
um you want to take the second question

805
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:50,799
you're local muted is this better

806
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,039
yes okay sorry i forgot to turn off my

807
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,840
mic as well

808
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,240
just in case um yeah i would love to

809
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,440
take the second question

810
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,799
so you actually got another question

811
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,399
about how do you keep track of essential

812
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,120
units of intelligence in your notes

813
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,799
so um that really depends of what is the

814
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,080
report so if we're

815
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,279
if i'm doing a ctf for example i try to

816
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:11,760
do

817
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,279
um a shared document with my team

818
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,039
and but i the the

819
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,440
intel structure with them so i i tried

820
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,279
to to come to agreement

821
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,760
and say hey this is this is the

822
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,039
structure we're going to use

823
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,480
this is the link we're going to be

824
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
working on this please uh

825
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,519
track them um there if you

826
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,320
are working of a more um in-depth

827
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,840
investigation

828
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,000
i have a personal combination of one

829
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,360
node and moleskine

830
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,760
um i i like paper because it makes me

831
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,399
feel that i'm

832
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,679
i'm doing an all-time investigation

833
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,720
so i draw my notes there and polish them

834
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,440
in into my onenote so i have my template

835
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,200
of the report for that investigation

836
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,120
usually built in the onenote

837
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,760
i self-populated it and then i build a

838
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,440
document from uh

839
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,360
google docs and send it to the customer

840
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,519
or the stakeholders and then close it

841
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,760
and destroy it

842
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,480

850
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,679
part in a trace and a trace labs event

851
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,480
uh

852
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,880
my first one was the last one actually

853
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,799
and i got there because i did a funny

854
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,679
meme

855
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,120
uh uh they did a

856
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,760
uh contest and i was one of the winners

857
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,559
so

858
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,840
uh the the missing person uh

859
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,279
workflow really it's around two

860
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,279
mainly two things uh the first one is

861
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,799
the person and their

862
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,000
and their relatives and their circle of

863
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,919
influence or the circle of social

864
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,279
circles right

865
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,279
interestingly you learn a lot about the

866
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,720
person uh

867
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,360
by knowing who they're hanging out with

868
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
who are the friends who are the families

869
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,559
do they have partners

870
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,960
what grudges are in play and the second

871
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,399
thing is

872
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,360
when they went missing what were the

873
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,960
events that triggered that

874
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,960
that um that um

875
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,000
disappearance right so i will say the

876
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,159
main source for intel in my opinion when

877
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,760
you're talking about a missing person is

878
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,320
a face

879
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,880
face a good good facebook account you

880
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,039
sometimes find juicy facebook accounts

881
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,640
and sometimes you find an account that

882
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,440
is like

883
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,240
oh my god this is not this person never

884
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,279
posted and you go like

885
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,039
why why but um

886
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,440
definitely facebook is good because you

887
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,360
start pulling the thread of okay this

888
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,279
person was dating this person

889
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,279
they had a fight and these are examples

890
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,880
i'm not talking about

891
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,519
real cases but or this person has this

892
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,600
relative that they visited

893
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,360
and this is a good one four months

894
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,880
before disappearing

895
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,000
so you can see that path is

896
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,600
fresh and there's something in

897
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,599
intelligence that it's a

898
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,520
network analysis right it's like who's

899
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,960
connected with who

900
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,119
and the the weight between those

901
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,320
connection

902
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,719
is what might lead you to explore

903
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,239
further and then

904
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,520
then you start moving into um instagram

905
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,839
and then you start moving into gaming

906
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:26,719
platforms

907
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,440
looking for handles that the person has

908
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,320
used in the past

909
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,560
i will say to focus on two things mainly

910
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,280
the person's facebook relationships and

911
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,560
and circles

912
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,040
and the disappearance event what

913
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,480
happened that day that make them

914
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,960
disappear

915
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,199
thank you so much for that thank you

916
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,800
yeah everyone is impressed

917
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,000
uh also some of your of the speakers

918
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,440
coming after you so hopefully you didn't

919
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,399
scare them off

920
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,760
um but yeah thank you thanks for being

921
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,599
here and uh thanks for being on

922
