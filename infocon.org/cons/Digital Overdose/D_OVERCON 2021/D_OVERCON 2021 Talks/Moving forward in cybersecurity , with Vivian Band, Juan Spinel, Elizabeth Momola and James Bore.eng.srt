garden and having to prop up my

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,719
studio on a case of beer which is a

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,320
shame for everyone

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,840

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,880
introductions so

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,279
rookie

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,960
they may sometimes still think of

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,560
themselves as rookies they are wrong

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,400
they've had that experience and they are

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,600
experienced professionals

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,440

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,878
okay and some of the audience may not

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,560
know this but of course you all had your

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,200
first

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
speaking experience public speaking

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,319
experience

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,800
and was that a few months ago somewhere

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,440
in the mid

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,720
lockdown haze so

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,680
you've been through what every single

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
speaker at this conference is going

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
through

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
so going backwards this time we'll start

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
with v

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,120
what's your tip for them the few who are

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,959
left to speak and also anyone else

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,040
considering doing this

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
um i think just have confidence in your

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,080
topic you know

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,959
like the reason that you've been

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,319
selected to give a talk is because you

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,920
have a unique perspective on whatever

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,879
you're covering

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,480
so yeah i would say like

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,239
just yeah um just talk honestly

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,200
you know what do you actually think

80
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
about this um don't be

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,159
like sorry totally disorganized but

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,680
thinking like uh

83
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,959
just have confidence presenting your

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,840
topic you know it will go absolutely

85
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,200
fine

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
and one

87
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,400
i'm gonna pick up on where um bee

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,280
mentioned and

89
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
definitely if you have something that

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,319
you've experienced and you thought hey

91
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,000
that's interesting

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,280
you should absolutely try and present it

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
it can be something as simple as a

94
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,800
fireside chat or if you have a bigger

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,239
topic absolutely

96
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,280
apply for a conference

97
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,720
there's lots of things that are very

98
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,120
welcoming and will provide support

99
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
beer con we had some incredible mentors

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,080
i know there were some incredible

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
mentors working here for

102
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,000
digital overdose and these people will

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,120
help you

104
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,840
uh you know prepare your slides they

105
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,200
won't write your slides for you

106
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
but they will definitely help you be

107
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,239
able to practice it once or twice

108
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,040
help you give feedback on you know maybe

109
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
pacing

110
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,879
and definitely help you get rid of those

111
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,680
first-time

112
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,840
presenting nerves

113
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,000
elizabeth um i think that from

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,159
a rookie perspective the biggest fear

115
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,680
that um

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,239
i have any time i'm speaking about

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
something is that someone will tell me

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
oh like you're telling complete nonsense

119
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
or you haven't covered the entire topic

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,639
uh just remember that

121
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,479
what you're talking about is your

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,639
journey and your own experience

123
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,840
so you don't have to know everything um

124
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
and sharing through conferences like

125
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,360
that is really helpful for

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
other people who might not be familiar

127
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,800
with the subject

128
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,440
so don't be scared of questions and if

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,400
it's something that

130
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,919
you don't know you can always um tell

131
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,080
um that's a very interesting topic or

132
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,919
that's a very interesting perspective

133
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,120
it's worth exploring maybe in a next

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,600
talk

135
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,320
but um yeah don't be don't be afraid to

136
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,400
be to be challenged um

137
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
it's very good to share your own

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
experience and

139
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,800
share your knowledge i think to pick up

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,080
what you were saying elizabeth that was

141
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
kind of the entire reason why i wanted

142
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,880
to present my topic was i was kind of

143
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,639
hoping somebody would say ah no there's

144
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,000
this way easier way to do it that you

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,199
don't know about

146
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,400
and sadly nobody did so

147
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,160
i think yeah just sort of having more

148
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,680
unique perspectives like it's good for

149
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,880
um

150
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,400
potential collaboration because i've met

151
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,520
so many people that have helped me out

152
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,560
with like potential

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,440
research directions so yeah i think

154
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,039
networking was something that like

155
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,400
uh was the main thing that i got out of

156
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,320
presenting at a conference definitely

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,360
recommend it

158
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,039
i just want to pick up on something

159
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,639
there because obviously you've all been

160
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,360
doing things

161
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,800
since your first talk um

162
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
and i know the community around that

163
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
first orchestra have been extremely

164
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,120
supportive

165
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,520
which is great i've found over the years

166
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:47,919
that

167
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,240
the hardest thing to find is challenge

168
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,199
and

169
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,400
constructive criticism people are very

170
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,120
unwilling to be negative have you

171
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
have you started to encounter that or is

172
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,639
it something where you're not worried

173
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,479
about it at the moment have you had

174
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,880
useful criticism that tells you how to

175
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
improve

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
how's that been going for you since that

177
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,919
first time

178
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,039
just opened to the floor

179
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,000
um so for me

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,440
as i said unfortunately nobody's come

181
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
forward and said oh there's this one

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,479
command that you can do to scan all of

183
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,319
ipv6 or whatever you know that's not

184
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,039
happened

185
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,160
sadly but i think um for example like

186
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,520
i've been talking to one about like

187
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,360
writing a possible scenario for secure

188
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,199
by scenario to do with my research it's

189
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,639
like okay well if we can get people to

190
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,000
sort of play

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
and see how they would respond to that

192
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
that's quite interesting information in

193
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,840
itself it might give me some more

194
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
directions to look in

195
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,440
so for me i've not actually had a

196
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,199
problem getting constructive criticism

197
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,759
like just

198
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,120
collaborate with people and talking with

199
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,639
them that sparks off ideas you know

200
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,639
having a sounding board

201
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,759
so i'd say i personally haven't been

202
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,039
doing much to see

203
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,520
actively seek uh criticism because i'm

204
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,800
still sort of designing the experiments

205
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,400
and still need to run them

206
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,479
i think yeah there's been quite a lot of

207
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,759
opportunities i've just come up

208
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,160
you know as i've been talking to people

209
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,599
yeah so i think if i actually

210
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,880
went and looked for feedback people

211
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
would be very willing to give it

212
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,919
especially if i said to them like

213
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,599
don't be nice about this if there's

214
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,120
something wrong with this tell me

215
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,319
and they will be honest with you

216
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,720
i feel that because i'm a rookie

217
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,400
i'm the harshest judge for my own work

218
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
so anything that i do i will always

219
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
think it's just not good enough

220
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,080
um i haven't met with like any harsh

221
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,039
criticism from other people about why

222
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,240
what i'm doing

223
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,479
but i always ask for that feedback just

224
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,680
like we said

225
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
it's it's extremely helpful especially

226
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,960
if you're new to the topic

227
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
to get a different approach or a

228
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,080
different angle to

229
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,759
to problem solving and conferences like

230
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,560
this one is an amazing opportunity to to

231
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,319
sort of

232
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,319
meet other people's viewpoints on

233
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,520
different things or

234
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,639
learn about new subjects new topics uh

235
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,319
and there's a huge community there

236
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,639
um not just digital overdose but there's

237
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,319
there's other conferences there

238
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,960
and from my own perspective people who

239
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,639
are behind those conferences

240
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,000
are extremely supportive and welcoming

241
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,240
so sometimes it's just a matter of of

242
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,000
reaching out to other people and asking

243
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,400
for help if you get stuck with something

244
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
um so yeah definitely

245
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,840
always ask for some constructed feedback

246
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
on stuff that you do but also

247
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,840
don't be too harsh on yourself if you

248
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,599
know what i mean like that that's what

249
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,839
at least i do it's always like not good

250
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,839
enough for me

251
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,080
the beach is always nice in the tropics

252
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,880
i'm no longer working with uh compliance

253
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,360
um

254
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,760
in that field uh so i haven't really

255
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,240
been challenged on that level

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
i have found some rather interesting

257
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,600
perspectives

258
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,240
uh where companies require more

259
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,959
sensitive or

260
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,720
data which is more sensitive than what

261
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,399
they currently have

262
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
in order to get rid of the notes of

263
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,399
sensitive data

264
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,760
and i've been able to net because

265
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
from beer con i was able to then network

266
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,040
with other people who were

267
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,600
far more specialized in this and uh they

268
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,320
do provide

269
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,519
a lot of insights again not necessarily

270
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
on my work but definitely still uh

271
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,680
providing new perspectives to why things

272
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,519
might be done

273
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,240
i do regularly share elizabeth's talk

274
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,279
with my university

275
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,240
classmates because most of them are in

276
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,880
the uk

277
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
obviously this was open university so

278
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,720
lots of people who

279
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,399
will be starting out or who might be

280
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,760
finishing off

281
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,839
and uh lots of people who are in this

282
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,120
situation because they're currently

283
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,240
working and say you know

284
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,680
you do have this solution which exists

285
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,279
and people are always like oh

286
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,800
uh we didn't know about this and you

287
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
know this is precisely why

288
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,839
having people who step up and say hey

289
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
you know this was my experience

290
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,360
it's so important because there's so

291
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
many people who don't know about it

292
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,279
and who could take advantage of those

293
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,760
situations get that work experience

294
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,680
and get that academic experience as well

295
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,440
i just want to add that i've also shared

296
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,040
your talk with people elizabeth

297
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
so undergrads i've been teaching in labs

298
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,079
i've been saying like hey take a look at

299
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:32,399
this

300
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,519
you know you don't need to know

301
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,959
everything about computing to get into

302
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,640
started infosec

303
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,320
this is an example path so it's been

304
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,360
really helpful for them sort of like

305
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,200
gaining confidence about like okay yeah

306
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,800
you can do this

307
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,320
there's been a lot said about the

308
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,560
supportive community with vietcon 2 and

309
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,720
obviously i've seen the community

310
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,000
with digital overdose i've also seen

311
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,360
other rookie cons where it seems to be

312
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,040
more a case of just come along and give

313
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,920
your first talk

314
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,959
and that's it how important

315
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,399
is it to have mentoring and or

316
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,560
an actual community of people who are

317
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
who know they're all speaking and know

318
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,279
they're all going through that same

319
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
experience

320
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,800
i think that's the most important thing

321
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,760
in the world

322
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,399
at least from my perspective to have

323
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,440
good mentoring

324
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
to guide you through and to challenge

325
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,959
you as well in a way

326
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,640
so you can um step out of your comfort

327
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,279
zone

328
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,320
and try new things or you know learn new

329
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,200
things

330
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,560
um my journey and infosec didn't start

331
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,000
with my current company

332
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,839
and in the previous company that i

333
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,600
worked for which was really amazing and

334
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
really friendly and

335
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,360
everyone was absolutely lovely but the

336
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,480
problem was there wasn't

337
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,880
enough mentoring from my perspective

338
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,079
there wasn't enough

339
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,959
people sacrificing time to sit down with

340
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,760
me and

341
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,320
explain stuff to me and i mean there is

342
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,680
a lot of resources

343
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
you have all the different dogs and all

344
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,040
the different trainings

345
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,800
but there's a huge difference between

346
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,720
doing a course and sitting down with

347
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,360
someone

348
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,920
where you can ask questions to the point

349
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,120
and get answers

350
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,040
for the questions that you have like you

351
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,600
know very specific questions

352
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
so i think that joining conferences like

353
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,000
this and taking advantage of the mentors

354
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,279
who are there and are

355
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,560
absolutely willing to sit down with you

356
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,120
to answer any questions whether they

357
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
seem silly or whether they seem really

358
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,320
serious

359
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,040
is a huge thing and everybody should use

360
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,760
that

361
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,399
to their own advantage that's my own

362
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,880
experience

363
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,560
i think the beer con community came up

364
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,279
because they

365
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,920
the beer farmers they said okay here's

366
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
the speakers

367
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,360
here's four mentors figure it out

368
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,040
between yourselves

369
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
and so the speakers really did get

370
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
together to try to

371
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,639
build each other up which i think

372
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,519
certainly helps a lot to

373
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,279
to work because you obviously don't have

374
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,800
one mentor each you

375
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
you have limited resources and so this

376
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,079
means that you

377
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,880
also help each other build up on your

378
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,839
talks

379
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,040
you get the additional eyes

380
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,360
as it were um on what's on the end

381
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,480
product

382
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
i did go through a different conference

383
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,800
which had a very different style

384
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,440
the rookies were assigned one mentor and

385
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
so while you do have a much more

386
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,120
focused uh perhaps mentorship

387
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,279
you do miss out on the all the other

388
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,880
speakers who are going to be providing a

389
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,839
different uh

390
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,600
perspective because they might come from

391
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,760
that field they might know about

392
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,199
some elements that you might not have

393
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,120
thought about as you mentioned before

394
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,000
this

395
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,040
constructive criticism that um would be

396
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,519
coming

397
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,959
directly before you're giving your talk

398
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,560
maybe giving some more

399
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,079
uh thought process to what you're going

400
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,839
to be sharing

401
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,320
on the day

402
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,519
i feel like um the fact that we had this

403
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,639
sort of session

404
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,160
um completely independently of the

405
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
conference organizers with the mentors

406
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
like all the people who'd be speaking it

407
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,639
sort of felt like we were in sort of

408
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,880
like seminar or like lecture together

409
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,000
so it kind of always felt like you were

410
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
bonding as a class kind of so i felt

411
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,120
about it and i appreciate that's

412
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,800
probably because i am a student and have

413
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,199
been for the past six years

414
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,040
so i will think of it in those terms but

415
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,760
um yeah i feel like

416
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,839
for me it's a bit of a strange one

417
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,440
working in research i've got like plenty

418
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,120
of contacts to work in academia and

419
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,839
networks research which is my background

420
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,519
so i feel like having the opportunity to

421
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,720
connect with people actually work in

422
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,600
industry

423
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
and do all this you know um practical

424
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
stuff day to day i felt like okay it

425
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,079
would be

426
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,000
amazing to finally sort of get to talk

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
to them and share their perspectives on

428
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:44,720
the work

429
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,920
um so yeah i think for me

430
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,360
sort of the community

431
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,560
the community of people i've met through

432
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
vidcon has been absolutely invaluable

433
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,440
you know i've learned so much from

434
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,880
following them on twitter talking to

435
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,320
them just you know and sort of like

436
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,519
leaving chats that we have sometimes

437
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,000
about

438
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,880
working in infosec i think it could be

439
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
talking to beerco was the first time i

440
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,920
sort of felt like i kind of belonged

441
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,839
in an infosec community before then i

442
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,360
sort of felt like oh well i just do

443
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,639
networks you know that's not what the

444
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,079
infosec is it

445
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,000
and i'll be proving so wrong like by

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,440
speaking at beercon um

447
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,360
people have said you know like infosec

448
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,279
is a very broad church you belong here

449
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,399
and there's all these supportive people

450
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,000
that are you know willing to help if you

451
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,279
have any questions

452
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,839
so it's been great yeah

453
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,199
so i know a lot of people who are very

454
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,040
open willing to mentor and very

455
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,920
open welcoming and one of the hardest

456
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,040
things seems to be

457
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,199
getting people to ask for help getting

458
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,279
people to ask to sit down

459
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,199
so what advice do you have people who

460
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,120
want to be mentors who want help with

461
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,600
these

462
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
things to encourage people to talk to

463
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,600
them

464
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
i'm also just going to add in that if

465
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,560
the audience have any questions

466
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,399
now's probably the time to throw in

467
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,079
because by the time this one is answered

468
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,440
they'll have made their way through the

469
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,079
delay

470
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,480
and hopefully interfere with nicholas

471
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,759
will ask them of us

472
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,120
can you repeat that question james um

473
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,360
what what's your advice for people who

474
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,160
want to mentor who want to help

475
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,360
to get people to ask them to give that

476
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,240
time because i've

477
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,160
spoken to a lot of people who do have

478
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
something to give and want to

479
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,720
but they never get asked about it or

480
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,240
they rarely get asked about it except

481
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,199
through formal scheme

482
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,639
so tanya yanka does the

483
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,320
mentoring monday and so she

484
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,399
where they try to put people together

485
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,600
within their fields

486
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,279
people looking for mentorship and people

487
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,759
who wish to mentor

488
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,279
which is uh an existing solution

489
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,839
definitely participating in the com in

490
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,279
the communities

491
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,720
when people ask for questions being able

492
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,880
to provide insights

493
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,399
does help but

494
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,160
in the end you you it is a bit of an

495
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,599
active participation from

496
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,639
both sides i would say

497
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,280
yeah i would i i would agree on that

498
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,319
sorry

499
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,480
sorry um but it takes both sides

500
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,880
to be active for the mentoring to take

501
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,679
place uh

502
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,199
and i think that from my perspective

503
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,039
it's sometimes intimidating if there's

504
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,559
someone who has

505
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,880
loads and loads of experience to reach

506
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,080
out and ask questions

507
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,360
because you're thinking they'll just

508
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,760
think it's something completely silly or

509
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
stupid or something obvious

510
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,760
so maybe for people who are rookies

511
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,000
and are looking for mentors don't be

512
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
afraid to ask any questions

513
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,640
because they're not silly there's no

514
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
such thing as a silly question

515
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,799
and very often it's it's so much better

516
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,240
to ask a question

517
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,880
than do something blindly or ignore

518
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,600
something

519
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,720
um so definitely have that courage

520
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,799
and the worst thing that could happen if

521
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,480
you ask someone for help

522
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,400
is that they could say no but that's the

523
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,160
worst thing that could happen

524
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
you won't be beat with a stick or

525
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,919
anything like that for asking questions

526
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,200
or reaching out

527
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,440
um and for people who are maybe looking

528
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,320
to mentor

529
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,799
but don't have people reaching out i

530
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,080
think that getting involved in

531
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,760
conferences like this

532
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,480
is an amazing opportunity to to find

533
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,000
those people who want to be

534
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,559
mentored and who are just starting their

535
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,360
journeys

536
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,280
rookie conferences like this or the

537
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,400
beaucon one

538
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
and there's a lot of people there who

539
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,840
aren't maybe taking their first steps

540
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,440
and are looking for someone who

541
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
would guide them or tell them what to

542
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,559
learn next or

543
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,280
what to look at um so there's definitely

544
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
potential there's people there who are

545
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,600
looking for mentors but maybe they're

546
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,080
just

547
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,639
too shy to ask or too scared to look

548
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,280
oh totally second uh well let's decide

549
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,160
about asking questions

550
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
like i have lost any shame about asking

551
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
questions i just go and tweet someone a

552
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,039
message them you know

553
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,320
like um on the whole yeah people have

554
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,919
been really good you know i've got like

555
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,280
so much information i've learned from

556
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
people just through doing that

557
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,200
as for mentoring i don't know too much

558
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,240
about that like i'll look into the

559
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,000
mentoring mondays thing that one

560
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,720
uh talked about i think partially

561
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,960
because outside of my niche of like ipv6

562
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,400
and ipv6 scanning

563
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,520
um i would consider myself a rookie at

564
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,200
a lot of other topics in infosec so for

565
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,799
me i'm personally looking for peers i

566
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,160
can sort of learn with

567
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
or groups or discord servers and things

568
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,440
people to follow on twitter and i think

569
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,880
okay that's an interesting blog post let

570
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,240
go and read that

571
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
so for me i'm not at the stage where i

572
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
seek to be a mentor at the moment

573
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,760
um i'm finding peer community is quite

574
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,120
helpful where people sort of learn

575
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,239
together as newbies

576
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,080
thank you and hopefully nicholas is in

577
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,559
the room

578
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,320
somewhere hidden away i can't see him

579
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,400
because of the screen layout i've got

580
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,000
with any questions that have come in

581
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,320
if he's not there i'm just going to look

582
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,720
stupid

583
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,000
um he's not there and i can't see any

584
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,039
questions coming in right thank you

585
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,679
i will add however to your previous

586
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,960
question

587
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,080
as some if you do have

588
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,600
or if you are a mentor and you do have

589
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,760
someone that you're mentoring

590
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,799
it's very important to be able to make

591
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,799
yourself relatable

592
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,880
that's to say you've been there before

593
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,960
because when they make a mistake

594
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,280
especially if you're in the same company

595
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,880
you also want to make sure that they're

596
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,720
willing to come and say hey i messed up

597
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,159
can you help me out

598
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,320
and not try to hide it under the rug

599
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,960
so being able to say you know like this

600
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,400
is a mistake i made when i was

601
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,480
starting out or you know

602
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,880
expl being able to share from experience

603
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
because that's also a great way of

604
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,360
learning

605
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
either personally or from transmitting

606
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,720
your past experiences

607
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,559
always try to learn from someone else's

608
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,159
mistakes if you can

609
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,120
yeah and that that seems to be a thing

610
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,440
and

611
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,640
there is there is almost an issue in

612
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,679
infosection in cyber security where

613
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,400
people who got very advanced in their

614
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,280
careers can

615
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,480
sometimes act as if they're perfect act

616
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,200
as if they've

617
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,039
never made any mistakes and they just

618
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,480
emerged

619
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,159
from i don't know an oyster on the sea

620
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,039
with all of this knowledge so how

621
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,200
important is it and one you've

622
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,799
basically answered this but i'd like to

623
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,799
ask

624
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,000
v and elizabeth as well how important is

625
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,880
it to

626
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
know and have people saying yes i've

627
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,679
made the same mistakes i've tripped up

628
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,520
on the same things

629
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
i've had the same challenges i've been

630
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
scared of asking what i thought were

631
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,640
stupid questions

632
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,400
how much of a difference does that make

633
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,159
as compared to the

634
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,280
more professorial perhaps method where

635
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,919
it's

636
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,760
i've got all of the answers and that's

637
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,919
it

638
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,440
it's interesting you mentioned

639
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
professorial there because like my

640
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,240
favorite lectures i've ever had at

641
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,840
university were ones where people say oh

642
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,960
hey i did this

643
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,880
i made this big mistake this happened it

644
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,799
was terrible don't do that

645
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,919
you know people have sort of um made no

646
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,679
bones about the facts like

647
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,960
the technologies that we're working with

648
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,320
are broken you know they're insecure

649
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,840
they're not the shiny image that you

650
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,960
often get presented in certain

651
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,559
beginner's lectures

652
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,080
so for me i think having a sort of

653
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,320
honest discussion

654
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,919
about like these mistakes i made was

655
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,440
very important for me when i was an

656
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,000
undergrad

657
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
like just gaining confidence so

658
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,440
when i started my computing science

659
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,880
degree i'd written like one python

660
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,480
script that was it i don't really know

661
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,360
anything

662
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,880
um so that really helps building my

663
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,400
confidence people sharing their mistakes

664
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,559
and saying like okay well maybe try this

665
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,760
or this is what helped me remember this

666
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,840
concept so i think

667
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,520
as i go through learning uh more and

668
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,360
more concepts in infosec like

669
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
for example at the moment i'm trying uh

670
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,640
starting on trying hack me because i

671
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,919
don't know anything about application

672
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,840
testing or cracking boxes or anything so

673
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,280
that's my new thing

674
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,799
i think it'll be the same process like i

675
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,080
enjoy reading people's write-ups where

676
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,440
they've said all right so

677
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,280
you know this trip me up this is how i

678
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,120
fixed it it's like right okay i remember

679
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,440
that

680
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,799
because there was an example attached to

681
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,640
it i tried to do the same thing when i'm

682
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,760
teaching people in labs

683
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,520
um because you quite often particularly

684
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,880
with people learning c

685
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,240
for some reason you get people sort of

686
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,840
carrying in the corner going oh i don't

687
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,200
understand any of this they just don't

688
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
want to ask you because they think

689
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
you'll go oh why don't you understand

690
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,200
this it's simple

691
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
so i usually open up with you know right

692
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,880
confession for the first three weeks of

693
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,080
this course i don't know how my luck

694
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,480
worked

695
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,240
or something like that you know just to

696
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,760
get them to open up and you know by the

697
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,799
time we're finished teaching the end of

698
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,080
the ten weeks

699
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,280
they're totally fine with talking about

700
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,960
things yeah so for me personally yeah

701
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,240
certain case studies i guess you could

702
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,279
call them are quite important

703
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,360
uh from my perspective um

704
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,720
having this image of being perfect and

705
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,039
not having any mistakes on your account

706
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,520
or any things that you regret

707
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,640
makes new people like myself

708
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,200
have this huge imposter syndrome where

709
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,240
you feel

710
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
i'm just not good enough for this or

711
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,400
like why am i doing this there's

712
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,159
so amazing people that just know

713
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,000
everything and never ever had

714
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,520
any problems so i think this culture of

715
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,720
openly talking about your mistakes and

716
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,919
and problems that you encountered just

717
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,400
gives more confidence to the new people

718
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,520
stepping into

719
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,559
cybersec um in my current

720
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,279
role i am at the moment training new

721
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,039
starts to be security analysts

722
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,080
and i openly talk about yeah i i've done

723
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,840
this so many times i've

724
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,000
i've not looked at this or i forgot

725
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
about this or

726
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
you know you can do this mistake or that

727
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
mistake um and i think

728
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,000
that creates awareness of what you can

729
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
possibly do wrong

730
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
so you're talking about possible

731
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,440
repercussions

732
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,159
and effects of what could happen if you

733
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:02,720
do this

734
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,600
the wrong way but you're also admitting

735
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,159
that

736
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,840
everybody goes through this stage where

737
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,440
you're learning and

738
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,679
through those mistakes you're gaining

739
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,279
actual experience

740
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,760
so i think it's it's very crucial and

741
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,640
and

742
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,760
infosec to talk about how things can go

743
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,480
bad

744
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,320
and what could be the possible

745
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,559
consequences consequences of things

746
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,679
going back

747
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,559
you can't have a culture of people um

748
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,159
just talking about how great and

749
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,000
wonderful everything is with

750
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,080
all the systems perfectly configured

751
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,919
that's that's not the real world

752
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,880
in the real world you come up with so

753
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,679
many different

754
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,720
issues and you have to know how to

755
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,840
um with a combine face them and

756
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,080
embrace the lesson that you learned from

757
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
from those mistakes

758
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,200
so definitely it's worth talking about

759
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
the mistakes and the problems that you

760
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,360
encountered and how you handled it

761
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,959
for the other people to learn from that

762
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,039
thank you so you'll have to excuse the

763
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,240
butler there

764
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,960
popping in with a drink i think we're

765
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,400
coming to the end but i

766
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720
just want to ask a final particular

767
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,440
question

768
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,919
for any rookies watching this either

769
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,000
live or recorded or being told about

770
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,960
it what are your thoughts on them

771
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,799
regardless of where they think they are

772
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,480
just giving a go at something like a

773
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,840
rookie conference

774
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,960
do you need to wait to be ready for it

775
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,200
to wait to be confident enough or

776
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,880
would you suggest just committing to it

777
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,559
and seeing what happens

778
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,159
uh let's start with one

779
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,960
apply for the cfp and start working on

780
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,760
your slides

781
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,600
before they confirm whether you got it

782
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,159
or not because

783
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,120
uh as can happen is you'll be accepted

784
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,480
and then you just have one week to start

785
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,840
working on them

786
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,880
it's like i would have you thought one

787
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,400
said you know just apply for the cfp

788
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,159
anyway you know decision is theirs to

789
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,760
make whether your top gets accepted or

790
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,400
not just

791
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,360
you need to have your hat in the room um

792
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,039
but referring to what i said at start of

793
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,640
this like just be confident in your

794
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
perspective you know your perspective is

795
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,120
unique

796
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,360
have confidence in it present it

797
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,320
from my perspective is that it's always

798
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,679
worth to do the jump

799
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,240
in the deep water and challenge yourself

800
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
the fact is that

801
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,399
before you do the first talk you will

802
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,320
never ever feel that you're ready

803
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,120
it's just after that first talk when you

804
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,080
see how it is

805
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,600
and you get the experience and you'll

806
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,159
see that like no one will shout at you

807
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,320
no one will challenge you it's all fine

808
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,399
even if you forget what you meant to say

809
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,000
or even if something doesn't go

810
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,320
according to the plan it's not the end

811
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,000
of the world so once you get that

812
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,039
first talk out of the way then you'll

813
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,399
gain more confidence

814
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,679
so just jump in the deep water and even

815
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,039
if you feel that you're not ready

816
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,279
and i think that's i would have said a

817
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,880
perfect note to end on but i've been

818
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,440
told one or two more minutes

819
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,039
so just quickly then how have you all

820
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,720
been doing since vietcon because it's

821
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,640
been a while since some of us spoke one

822
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,080
i know you've been doing the secure by

823
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,399
scenario

824
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,719
lee and elizabeth how have you been

825
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,840
[Laughter]

826
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,760
doing

827
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,039
um i've been talking at a few

828
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,480
um other well conferences talks um

829
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,559
about my apprenticeship program because

830
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,039
again i think it's an amazing thing

831
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,279
and i would like to encourage as many

832
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,080
people who

833
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,919
want to make this transition to to

834
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,200
consider it or

835
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,799
even learn more about it um so it's it's

836
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,159
been great i've been doing a bit of

837
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,120
mentoring for

838
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,000
digital overdose more from a perspective

839
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,799
of

840
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,279
i'm a rookie i'm afraid to talk it's my

841
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,039
first talk i don't know whether someone

842
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,520
will challenge me or not

843
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,520
and that's been a great experience to be

844
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,200
on their other side and just encourage

845
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
people and give them you know some

846
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,039
pep talk and say you do fine it's an

847
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,720
amazing talk

848
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,120
so it's going amazingly there's lots of

849
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,159
things happening

850
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,159
uh there's my uni course as well that's

851
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,000
that's happening with few submissions

852
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,039
coming

853
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,080
approaching me very rapidly so always

854
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,120
busy but in a very positive

855
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,000
evolving way

856
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,640
uh so i've been quite quiet um i've done

857
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,559
a pre-recorded talk not long after beer

858
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,480
cod which was fine but it's not the same

859
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,600
as presenting it live so i think i've

860
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,120
got a strong preference for presenting

861
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,559
live which i never thought i would say

862
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,399
in a million years

863
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,039
but here we are so currently i've been

864
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,399
writing up experiment plans and trying

865
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,679
to design it and trying to negotiate

866
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,360
with it services and whatnot to be able

867
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,480
to run this scanner

868
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,720
uh so i'm a bit quiet at the moment but

869
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,000
as soon as i've got results in i'm going

870
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,760
to try and do a lot more presentations

871
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,159
both

872
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,039
uh hopefully at academic conferences and

873
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,640
also definitely a load of like industry

874
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,080
workshop type talks

875
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,279
so i'm quite keen to sort spread the

876
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,640
word on this and get industry

877
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,000
perspectives about okay

878
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,039
how would this affect day to day

879
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,039
operations for example

880
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,600
so quite at the moment but really can't

881
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,960
wait to get back into talks

882
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,840
love public speaking though

883
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,559
and one other than the secure by

884
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,240
scenario i've seen you run a few of

885
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,600
those excellent they

886
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
encourage everyone to get involved by

887
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,360
the way what have you been up to you

888
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,240
mentioned you're no longer in compliance

889
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,600
yeah so i'm no longer in compliance

890
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,360
but that's obviously just on the

891
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,120
professional side of things

892
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,039
after beer con i gave another talk on

893
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,480
gdpr

894
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,159
where i mentioned some failure

895
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,799
strategies failure strategies which i'd

896
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,760
seen

897
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,720
in real life and explaining how these

898
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,080
strategies

899
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
led to non-compliance and i'm

900
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,640
now going to be giving a talk next week

901
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:02,960
at

902
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,039
isolation con on reverse engineering

903
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,240
intelligence gathering process from

904
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,679
when a nice irish fellow found me of a

905
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,360
really dodgy blurry picture

906
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,840
of the lake

907
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,399
look forward to that one right i think

908
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,000
that does actually bring us to the end

909
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,679
i've not had another pop up saying a few

910
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,480
more minutes

911
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,799
so thank you all for

912
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,200
being willing to jump in and come to

913
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,760
this panel thank you all for the answers

914
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,440

915
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,919
