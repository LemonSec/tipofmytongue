1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,879
i want to give a big warm welcome to

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:07,520
sartech

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,880
he is an active community member in

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,320
digital overdose and will be presenting

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,120
for us today take it away sartech

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,480
yeah cool uh thank you aiden and atomic

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
uh so today i'll be talking about the

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,320
zero trust model

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,720
and the imposters that are among us so

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,880
here's a thing

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,470
where

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,500
[Music]

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
and i work as an information security

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
engineer

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,239
you can find me on the mentioned

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,239
discount accounts

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,640
so there we go so uh zero trust model

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,520
was created by

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,320
john kendall uh during his tenure as a

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,199
vice president

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,879
and principal analyst for forestry

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,559
research he realized that

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,839
the existing security models

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,439
should be trusted but as we all

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,000
as we all see that this model is broken

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,760
and nothing inside the network is

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,799
trusted for now

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,280
so the zero trust model recognizes that

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
trust is a vulnerability

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,439
once on the network users including

31
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,400
thread actors

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,840
and militias insiders are free to move

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,159
laterally

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,040
access or exfiltrate whatever data they

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,799
are not limited to

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,119
remember the point of infiltration of an

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,159
attack is often not the target location

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,400
under this broken trust model it is

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
assumed that the user's identity is not

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,000
compromised and that all users are

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,439
responsible and can be trusted so

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,720
buy a zero trust model is needed uh

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,940
zero this model comes in place

44
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,040
[Music]

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,960
so many people secure

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
and we like we need a single person to

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,880
manage

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
each and every tool so with the modern

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,080
workforce becoming

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,239
increasingly on the go accessing

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,080
applications from multiple devices

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
outside of a business parameter

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,599
enterprises have adopted

54
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,280
a verified interest and then trust again

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,000
model

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,319
which means if someone has the correct

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,599
user credentials

58
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,239
they are admitted to whichever site app

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:26,959
or device

60
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,200
they are requesting this resulted in an

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
increasing risk of exposure

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
dissolving what was once trusted

63
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,560
enterprise zone of control

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,280
but to become to remain competitive in

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
the business

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,200
the businesses needed a zero trust model

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,080
architecture

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,400
able to protect the enterprise data

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,959
wherever users and devices are

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,760
while also ensuring that applications

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
work quickly and seamlessly

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
uh this is the quote i love about zero

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,640
twist model and

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
like it is a summary of entire zero

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,720
trust model

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
that zero twist is not about making a

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,080
system trusted

78
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,560
but instead about eliminating the trust

79
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,040
uh now we will uh discuss about the

80
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,840
imposters

81
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,959
that can be in our network so the first

82
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,840
point is uh

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,720
insider threats by insider threads i

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,360
mean

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
that they can be both granted and site

86
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
rental employees

87
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,840
granted employees can be ex-employees

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
although

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
all the employees planted by the

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,879
competitors of the business

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,080
scientific people who are temporarily

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,319
unhappy so

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,840
for example how the how they can

94
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,319
how they are

95
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,840
management due to some ex so and showing

96
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,920
up

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,010
[Music]

98
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,599
so application control appliances carbon

99
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,279
black or britney contrast

100
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,560
working so that person have to take the

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,880
necessity permissions or approvals for

102
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,320
from the management

103
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,840
otherwise body

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,080
uh oh everyone um give us a second

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,560
uh the stream seems to have broken we'll

106
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
be we'll be back in a second

107
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,199
uh oh it has in fact not broken

108
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,680
yep yeah go ahead so

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
so i was discussing about the

110
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
application controls

111
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
appliances so

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,639
first we have a like carbon black in

113
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,479
place so what it does is it

114
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,080
uh tracks and monitors on the every

115
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,560
application which is access modified or

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,720
executed by the end user

117
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,360
so if a

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,919
it will be blocked by the application

119
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,800
control

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,759
so how it is related to zero trust is

121
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,440
zero trust

122
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,280
believes in that no one should be

123
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,000
trusted like it eliminates the trust

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,160
factor as i discussed before

125
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,600
devices can be trusted and infected both

126
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,840
using devices and attacker can move

127
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
laterally on the network

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
applications can be trusted and

129
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
compromised both

130
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
so we come to

131
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,039
we come to sasc sac secure access

132
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,080
service search

133
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,680
also pronounced just sassy before diving

134
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
into the specifics of sassy

135
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
it's important to understand a bit of

136
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,759
background on this new term

137
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,360
existing network approaches and

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,759
technologies simply no longer provide

139
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,199
the levels of security

140
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,880
and access control digital organizations

141
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
need more levels of security and access

142
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,240
control

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,479
as we are evolving every day in the

144
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,479
terms of security

145
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,960
these organizations demand immediate

146
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,280
uninterrupted access for their users

147
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,199
no matter where they are located in the

148
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,720
world within

149
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,120
increase in remote users and software as

150
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,800
a service applications

151
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
data moving from the data center to

152
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
cloud services

153
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,160
and more traffic going to public cloud

154
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,759
services

155
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,240
to the main data centers and branch

156
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,600
offices

157
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
is increasing every day so sassy comes

158
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,039
in place

159
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,639
so basically uh

160
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,880
i i can share a document with the sassy

161
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,000
and uh there is a

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,520
bun gardener provision of 2019

163
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,360
named as the future of network security

164
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,039
in the cloud i'll be posting all the

165
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,880
resources regarding sassy and the zero

166
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,639
trust model

167
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,120
so with so many uh similar terms and

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,479
acronyms floating around

169
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,080
it's important to make sure you

170
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,840
understand what a vendor is actually

171
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,720
talking about

172
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,520
when you're discussing solutions so

173
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
there comes three more terms

174
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,319
as you can see ztna zta

175
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,759
and uh zero trust model so uh

176
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,400
zero trust model is traditional model it

177
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,199
involved

178
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,000
into the zero trust access model then

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,520
finally into the zero truss

180
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,039
network access mod so the concept of

181
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,720
zero test came because

182
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
the old network security model of

183
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,319
insight means trusted

184
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
and outside means untrusted no longer

185
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,759
works

186
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,080
the zero trust model moves security away

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,000
from implied

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
that is based on network locations

189
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,720
instead it focuses on evaluating trust

190
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,879
on a per transaction business

191
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,000
what we mean by transaction here is

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,879
transaction is uh like basically flow of

193
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,039
data how data flows from different

194
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,400
uh centers to devices to users then

195
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,720
zero trust access comes in place zero

196
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,840
trust access is

197
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,400
about knowing and controlling who and

198
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,080
what is on your network

199
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
role based access control is a critical

200
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
component of access management as we all

201
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,360
know

202
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,919
only by knowing definitely who a user is

203
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,560
can be

204
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,360
appropriate level of access be granted

205
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
based on the loan

206
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,919
the user can be employed a guest or a

207
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,000
contractor or may be a threat to our

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,559
organization what is the role and what

209
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,958
not network access rights does that rule

210
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,080
and title them to

211
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
we need to know that unfortunately ztna

212
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
isn't the most obvious naming convention

213
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,640
in the industry

214
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
because although it's called zero trust

215
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080
not network

216
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
access it's really all about brokered

217
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,240
access for users

218
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
about brokered access we will discuss in

219
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,000
further slides i'll be talking about

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
cloud security access broker

221
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,160
for the uh so coming back to say dna

222
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,839
it's really all about brokered access

223
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,160
for users to applications

224
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,640
so it might have been clear to call it a

225
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,720
zero trust application access

226
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,800
but for a better or worse they decided

227
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,880
to call it as a dna

228
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,920
a key takeaway is that ztna is an

229
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,839
element of the larger zta proposition

230
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,839
so how the sassy infrastructure works

231
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,320
so again we have so many multiple

232
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,680
technical terms

233
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,640
so we will start about i'll start uh

234
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,600
explaining

235
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,120
every term one by one then i'll

236
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,279
correlate them with each other

237
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,680
so as we all know what bran is it's a

238
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,959
simplest form of

239
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,040
it's a simplest form collection of local

240
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,120
area networks or other networks that

241
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
communicate with one another

242
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,360
and we all know the largest fan we use

243
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
is the internet

244
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,600
we use it every day so then we come to

245
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,959
csp

246
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,760
csb is nothing but cloud access security

247
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,480
broker

248
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,240
is an on-premises or cloud-based

249
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,800
security policy enforcement point

250
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
that is placed between cloud service

251
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
consumers and cloud service providers

252
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
to combine and interject enterprise

253
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,959
security policies

254
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,920
as cloud-based resources are accessed

255
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,519
organizations are include

256
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,640
increasingly turning to csb vendors to

257
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,399
address cloud services

258
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,120
enforce secure policies and comply with

259
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,560
the regulations

260
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
even when cloud services are beyond

261
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,760
their perimeter and out of their

262
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,360
direction so

263
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,920
what we mean by beyond the payment and

264
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,480
out

265
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,560
of the that control is we are talking

266
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
about third parties here

267
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
the this bit does not directly come

268
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,079
under our organization

269
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,279
or management now we move forward to

270
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,320
fw ais which is nothing but firewall as

271
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,440
a service

272
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,760
it refers to a cloud firewall that

273
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,680
delivers advanced layer 7

274
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,320
next generation firewall capabilities

275
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,000
including access controls

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,360
url filtering set prevention ips and

277
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,720
ideas

278
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,160
with uh additional dns security

279
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,560
the concept of firewall as a service is

280
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,800
not about simply virtualizing the

281
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,560
appliances it also enables organization

282
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,640
to eliminate firewall appliances

283
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
and simplify their itune infrastructure

284
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,800
centralized movement from

285
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
single console enables organizations to

286
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,079
eliminate

287
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,519
the challenges of change control patch

288
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,560
management

289
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,720
coordinating outage windows and policy

290
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,640
management

291
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,760
so now i'll try to collect all these

292
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
concepts so you don't get confused in

293
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,720
between

294
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,079
so stasis is the convergence of ban and

295
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,880
network security services like casb

296
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,639
firewall as a service and zero trust

297
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,120
model

298
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,200
into a single cloud delivered service

299
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,399
model so basically sasses a package

300
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,720
which consists of van and all the other

301
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,320
network appliances

302
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,399
mainly csb firewall as a service and

303
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,519
zero trips

304
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,600
zero trust has all the other security

305
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
appliances in it like application

306
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,839
control ipsi

307
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
psn so

308
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,720
sassy capabilities are delivered as a

309
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
service base upon the

310
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,519
identity of the entity real-time context

311
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,480
enterprise security compliance policies

312
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
and continuous assessment of risk and

313
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,959
trust throughout the sessions

314
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,680
identities of entities can be associated

315
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,399
with people

316
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,880
group of people devices application

317
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,920
services

318
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,440
iot systems or edge computing location

319
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,720
uh i'll now just reference our gartner

320
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,440
report which

321
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,120
expects that by 2024 at least 40 percent

322
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,360
of

323
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
enterprises will have explicit

324
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,360
strategies to adopt chassis

325
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,680
up from less than one person at a year

326
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
in 2018.

327
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
a sassy architecture identifies users

328
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,399
and

329
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,680
devices applies policy based security

330
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,519
and delivers secure access to

331
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,760
appropriate application or data

332
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,839
this approach further allows us

333
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,560
organization to apply secure access

334
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,720
no matter whether users application or

335
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,079
device located

336
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,560
and that's the main like main goal of

337
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,760
sassy

338
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,800
that's why we need sassy

339
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,079
so this is our basic sassy structure

340
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,079
sassy's aim is to just blend these

341
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,000
services and technologies to build a

342
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,959
cloud aware

343
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,920
and cloud-based secure network the sassy

344
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,800
model is

345
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,360
especially appealing to organizations

346
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,440
that frequently use the cloud

347
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,920
and cloud services or are on a part to

348
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,800
the cloud

349
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,360
which are migrating to the cloud that is

350
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,320
this includes

351
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,720
distributed organizations for example

352
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,320
those with branch locations

353
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
and dispersed end users as well

354
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,839
businesses with iot and edge deployments

355
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,880
so i'll just give you a quick benefits

356
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,800
of sassy and how sassy can help your

357
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
organization in several ways

358
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,199
so first it can help with the

359
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,519
flexibility of the organization

360
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,279
with a cloud-based infrastructure you

361
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,519
can implement and deliver security

362
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,399
services

363
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,800
such as threat prevention web filtering

364
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,959
sandboxing dns security all at once

365
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,760
then second it helps us uh cut the cost

366
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,240
of the

367
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,000
appliances instead of buying and

368
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,079
managing multiple point products

369
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,920
utilizing a single platform will

370
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
dramatically reduce your cost

371
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,279
and ideal sources sassy also reduces the

372
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,000
complexity

373
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
complexity of the network you can

374
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
simplify your id infrastructure

375
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,320
by minimizing the number of security

376
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,120
products your it team has to manage

377
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,279
update and maintain consolidating your

378
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,399
security staff

379
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,560
into a single cloud-based network

380
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,839
security service model

381
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,959
so further yeah so coming to this point

382
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,839
basically people confuse that dna

383
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,160
is goes parallel with sassy

384
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,600
but it's not ztna versus sassy but is

385
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,720
it is that dna and sassy they both

386
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,760
work together as you can think sassy has

387
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
a higher level design philosophy than

388
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,480
set dna

389
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,800
they are not separate or completing

390
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
network security models

391
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,680
rather than ztn is part of an overall

392
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,760
note however that by zero trust

393
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
implementation may be a short to

394
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
medium term objective for network

395
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,240
architects sas is a long term goal

396
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
organizations may decide today that they

397
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
buy into sassy approach

398
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,240
and then move to slowly evolve their

399
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,440
network

400
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
and network security stands towards the

401
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,320
sassy model at the end of the move

402
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
this will take time and designers move

403
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,240
to replace outdated security

404
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,279
technologies

405
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,000
and better integrate those that remain

406
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,639
note that

407
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,120
moving to a sassy model both requires

408
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,959
and enables a zero test approach to the

409
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,600
network security

410
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,560
uh it's a common misconception of the

411
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,199
industry that deploying zero trust model

412
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,320
is costly and complex but

413
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,959
zigotrus model is not like a

414
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,759
architecture

415
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,680
where we need more appliances and more

416
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,880
things in place

417
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,399
but it's malia ideology of the network

418
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,040
or security architecture how he thinks

419
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,279
he can integrate the existing security

420
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,519
controls and models with the

421
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,880
uh with the existing borders so

422
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,639
to implement the zero truss model

423
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,079
there's a like five-step methodology to

424
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,880
implement the zero trust model which is

425
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
identifying the product surface

426
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,519
in which we identify the endpoints data

427
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,360
application infrastructure and network

428
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,880
topologies

429
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,120
you map the transaction flows how data

430
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
flows from one place to another one

431
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,399
device to another

432
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,320
and how devices are connected to each

433
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,399
other you build a zero trust

434
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,839
architecture

435
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,519
there are some guiding principles to

436
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,519
zero trust architecture which i'll be

437
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,320
discussing in the next slide

438
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,839
then you create a zero trust policy and

439
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,640
after uh performing these posture you

440
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,079
just monitor and maintain the

441
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
architecture

442
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,240
so there are like these four main

443
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,359
concepts to make the perfect

444
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
zero trust architecture you can use

445
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,160
utilize microsegmentation

446
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,079
micro segmentation is nothing but the

447
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,359
practice of breaking up

448
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,320
security parameters into small zones to

449
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
maintain separate access for separate

450
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,760
parts of the network

451
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
for example a network with files living

452
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
in a single data center

453
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,000
that utilizes micro segmentation may

454
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,919
contain dozens of separate and secure

455
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,720
zones

456
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,200
a person program or a device with access

457
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,160
to one of those

458
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,720
zones will not be able to access any of

459
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,480
the other zones without separate

460
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
authorization

461
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,440
second we come to mfa we all know what

462
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,400
mfa is

463
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,600
but mfa is evolving every day just like

464
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,640
the other things

465
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,320
other technologies mfa is basic building

466
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,039
block of an

467
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,679
intelligent approach to network security

468
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,679
properly use it reflects the guiding

469
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,039
principle of zero trust

470
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,440
never trust always verify and verify

471
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
again and again

472
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,000
so mfa basically nowadays work on three

473
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,360
basic factors

474
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,039
first is knowledge factor which is

475
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,200
something only the user knows

476
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,360
such as password pin or pattern a

477
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,799
position factor

478
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,760
something only the user has such an atm

479
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,080
card smart card on mobile phone

480
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,400
and an inheritance factor something

481
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,919
which contains a biometric

482
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,600
characteristics such as fingerprint

483
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,320
retina

484
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,280
scan or phase scan upon presentation

485
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
each factor must be validated for

486
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
authentication to occur

487
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,679
second we come to the principle of least

488
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,640
privilege

489
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,880
like principle of least privilege is

490
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,760
foundation of zero trust model

491
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
it is the practice of limiting access

492
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,160
rights for users to the bare minimum

493
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
permission they need to perform their

494
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
work under polp

495
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,240
users are granted permissions to read

496
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,600
write or execute

497
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,919
only the files or resources they need to

498
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,960
do their jobs

499
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,640
in other words the least amount of

500
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,480
preparedness

501
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,240
additionally the principle of least

502
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
privilege can be applied to restricting

503
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,360
access to sites for application system

504
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,000
and processes

505
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,720
then we come to validate all points

506
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,200
validating all endpoints is nothing but

507
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,440
verifying devices which are connected to

508
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,520
our network all they are trusted

509
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,640
and then verifying them the

510
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
in a iterative manner to check if they

511
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,960
are compromised or not

512
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,360
if the compromise if we contain them and

513
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,400
then

514
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,480
do the then we respond to them

515
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,880
next i'll come to the guiding principles

516
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,840
of zero trust

517
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,559
zero trust is basically based on three

518
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,200
basic

519
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,760
principles first one is verify

520
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,799
explicitly

521
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,720
which is always authenticate and

522
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,960
authorize based on all available data

523
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,679
points

524
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,159
including the user identity location

525
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,080
devices service or workload

526
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,440
user has happened second we come to use

527
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,000
or use on least privilege access i just

528
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,559
explained the principle of each

529
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,600
lease privilege which is giving the just

530
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,880
enough access or just in time access

531
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,200
then we come to the most important part

532
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
is um age

533
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,159
as there are like many organizations

534
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,720
which claim to be that they are very

535
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,440
secure

536
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,600
we should always assume the bridge we

537
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,640
should always work

538
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,760
on the on the minimization of the blast

539
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,200
radius for the bleachers

540
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,120
and prevent lateral movement by

541
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,039
segmenting access by network

542
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,559
user devices and applications verify

543
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,640
all sections that are encrypted into it

544
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,440
use analytics to get visibility

545
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
drive threat detection and improve your

546
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,080
defenses

547
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,200
then according to gartner report the

548
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
zero trust security market will grow to

549
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,840
grow from 19.6 billion dollars in 2020

550
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,159
to 51.6 billion dollars in

551
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,520
2026. so why organizations is moving to

552
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:13,919
the

553
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,360
zero trust model because

554
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,000
data security is

555
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,600
possible for securing business databases

556
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,559
an organization database compromise of

557
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,000
many sensitive data

558
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,159
bi personal health information that is

559
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,880
phi intellectual property that is ip

560
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,799
as well as payment card and financial

561
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,000
information

562
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,240
huge amount of data is generated every

563
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
day across every organization in

564
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,880
every industry verticals effective

565
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,960
management storage of business data is

566
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,440
becoming critical day by day for it and

567
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,799
data security professionals

568
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,760
so i'll be concluding my talk but before

569
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,799
concluding i

570
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,880
like to specially thank the redacted

571
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,480
eden yes

572
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,280
for having my back every time i was

573
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,120
afraid of doing something

574
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,000
and all the overcon mentors for always

575
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,720
helping me out and having my back

576
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,400
oh one more thing i uh

577
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,679
like i uh i have a confession that i uh

578
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,960
i suffer from a

579
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,760
posture syndrome and i admitted i come

580
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,799
forward with it

581
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,840
and like i i was reading a tweet uh in

582
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,880
the morning today

583
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,960
that lack of confidence kills more

584
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,039
dreams than the lack of ability

585
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,960
talent matters especially at lead levels

586
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
but people talk themselves out of giving

587
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,480
their best effort

588
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
long before talent becomes a limiting

589
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,720
factor you are capable of more than you

590
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,200
know

591
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,440
don't wear and give your best every time

592
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,320
you do thanks

593
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,400
awesome oh we've actually had a few

594
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,919

shout out to everyone that's helped you

607
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,600
and also tackling the

608
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,919
the topic of imposter syndrome i know a

609
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,760
lot of people uh

610
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,600
you know end up having issues with

611
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,880
imposter syndrome especially when it

612
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,400
comes to talks and stuff like that and

613
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,840
in cyber security

614
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,880
just about anyone could um

615
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,799
could suffer from it so that's really

616
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,000
big to talk about thank you

617
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
on that note uh atomic would you like to

618
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
get us started with the first question

619
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,600
okay i will um so the first question

620
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,720
we've gotten

621
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,919
give me a second um right so

622
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,000
what are those what are some

623
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,360
difficulties you face

624
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,039
when implementing a zero trust model

625
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,200
okay so the like organization i

626
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
currently work for is

627
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,440
going to uh towards the zero trust model

628
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,480
so

629
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,720
the main difficulties we are facing is

630
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,679
we are

631
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,880
like technologies or upgrading day by

632
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,520
day

633
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
so we have to remove the outdated

634
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,640
security employees

635
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,720
appliances every day and install the new

636
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,760
ones so

637
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,880
we need teams working on the deployment

638
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
of security tools and

639
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,840
tune them and maintain them in future

640
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,720
awesome fantastic

641
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
all right and then the second question

642
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,559
is do you personally find the zero trust

643
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,840
model to be effective

644
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,440
uh like as i said

645
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,080
zero trust model is not uh like an

646
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,440
architecture or something

647
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,279
everyone should follow and everything

648
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,360
it's not unnecessary but it's more like

649
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,200
ideology

650
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,880
if you do not trust your employees you

651
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,640
should not trust your devices which are

652
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,600
in your network

653
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,360
you should not trust the applications

654
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,799
you use on daily basis

655
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,200
everything can be compromised human

656
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,360
devices and applications everything

657
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,600
so why don't we take our precaution

658
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,279
before anything bad happens

659
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,120
awesome we have anything else yeah that

660
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,840
seems to be a

661
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,880
check you uh have a lot of support in

662
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,240
the youtube chat so be sure to check

663
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,799
that out

664
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,360
um but i think that's it for now no more

665
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,960
questions have pulled in

666
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:43,840
if there is any we'll send them to you

667
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,400
and so we'll be back
