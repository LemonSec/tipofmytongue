1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,240
hi

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,440
everyone my name is anastasia

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,320
or you can call me stacy hope everyone

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,360
is doing great

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,560
and ready for a new portion of

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,080
knowledge so uh in that presentation

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,359
my main goal is um actually to raise

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,560
awareness

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,160
of using ipv6 and that's why i want to

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,599
talk about it

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
from cyber security perspective so

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
first a bit about me uh i graduated

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
university

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
in on 2019 now i have

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,160
a master's degree on informational

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,520
system security

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,239
uh in general i've been working in at

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,520
for two and a half years

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,640
half of which i'm in cyber security and

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,120
um now i've been working as a security

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,559
analyst in the stock team

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,760
so today i'm going to cover uh a bit of

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
ipv6 introduction

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,119
types of ipv6 addresses um implementing

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,240
of ipv6

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
uh at your own environment and also

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,720
network reconnaissance

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,479
uh in ipv6 networks

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,640
let's start with that every device

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,759
that uses the internet is

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,439
identified through its own ap address

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,840
in order for internet communication to

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,960
work

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,200
so basically it's just like the street

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,799
addresses and zip codes

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,600
uh you need to know in order to send a

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
letter

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,600
ipv6 is the late is the latest version

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,399
of the internet protocol and uh the

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,119
version we

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,560
are all familiar with more is ipv4

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
the key difference uh between the

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,560
versions of the protocol

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,000
is that ipv6 has significantly more

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,280
address space

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,600
and as you can see addresses do look the

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,360
same as well

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,878
the ipv6 has 128-bit adjacent scheme

49
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,080
and that means that in it consists of

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,599
eight groups of four hexadecimal digits

51
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,160
uh with the group separated by columns

52
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,360
back on

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,640
and for comparison uh the ipv4

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,920
has 32-bit adjacent scheme so

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
it consists of four groups of decimal

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,200
digits

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,119
with the groups separated by dots

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,920
the expanded addressing capacity of ipv6

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,640
uh will enable supporting connectivity

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
for a huge range of devices such as

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,840
phones

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,440
laptops iot devices

63
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,560
and eventually the enormous amount of ap

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
addresses

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
gives an opportunity or like to get rid

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,599
of network addressing translation or net

67
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,319
and that means that every device has its

68
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,239
own public address

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,400
a pv6 public addresses are more known as

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,959
global unique address addresses and

71
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,480
they're just the equivalent of

72
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,080
public addresses in ipv4 networks

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,800
global addresses are routable on the

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,599
internet

75
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,040
but you might you may have questioned uh

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,680
does that mean that ipv6 has no private

77
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,400
addressing

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
well as you can see it doesn't

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,319
uh for example in ipv4 internal

80
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,879
addresses

81
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,319
it they these addresses uh use the

82
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,159
reserved number ranges

83
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,120
and uh these addresses are now are not

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,840
routed

85
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,480
on the internet and they are reserved

86
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,879
for

87
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,159
uh internal networks

88
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,200
ipv6 has two internal addresses

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,360
two types of internal addresses link

90
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,000
local and unique local

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,959
what about link local these addresses

92
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,000
are used to

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
communicate between hosts on the same

94
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,439
link

95
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,799
so that mean then that means that

96
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,480
they used they are used uh inside an

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,599
internal network

98
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,160
and again they are not routed on the

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,399
internet or even internal network so

100
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,800
they are restricted to um to a link

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,759
this addresses a self-assigned and uh

102
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,479
they do not

103
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,560
so that means they do not required any

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
dhcp

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,199
uh server on your network and uh

106
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,520
this addresses uh as you can see start

107
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,120
with fe

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,160
80 numbers

109
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,800
with 64 sub uh subnet mask

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,680
unique local they actually also the

111
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
internal private

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
addresses uh they used also inside an

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,520
internal network

114
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
they are also not routed on the global

115
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,960
internet

116
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
but they are routed on the internal

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,720
network so basically

118
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,160
they are equivalent um to the internal

119
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
ipv4 addresses

120
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,280
but nowadays uh uniqlo are not um

121
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
yet commonly implemented as far as i

122
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
know

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,560
so i mentioned uh that with ipv6 we

124
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
don't need net anymore

125
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,919
but you may also have a question want my

126
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,320
network be less secure without net

127
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,759
but actually translating addresses

128
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,639
does not provide any security benefits

129
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,919
because

130
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,360
in many cases nuts net or network

131
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,400
addressing translation require an

132
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,600
outgoing connection to be present before

133
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,759
they will allow an incoming connection

134
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,960
and

135
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,080
this so called stateful packet filtering

136
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,440
can be enabled for ipv6 as well

137
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,960
so you may already be thinking

138
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,919
how can i use ipv6 to access internet

139
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,560
internet

140
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,039
personally is that even possible of

141
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,560
course

142
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,000
first way to do that is just asking your

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
internet service provider

144
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,280
for ipv6 and for example on a wild

145
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,400
world ipv6 lounge website you can check

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,160
providers that joined ipv6 launching and

147
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
can provide you with a pv6

148
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,840
addresses but um

149
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
what if you don't have a provider in

150
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
your city or country that supports ipv6

151
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
actually that's not a problem because i

152
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,160
don't have one for example

153
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
there is a global internet provider

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,840
called hurricane electric

155
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,280
and it can provide ipv6 as well

156
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,520
so you can just fill out the form on

157
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
internal broker website

158
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
and get yourself global ipv6 with 64

159
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,639
subnet masks and just for free

160
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
and what 64 subnet mask gives you

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,319
well it gives us an opportunity to have

162
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,520
a subnet with that

163
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,599
amount of addresses i know that's

164
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,080
impressive

165
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,280
but so now is the main question with

166
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
that amount of subnets and

167
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,520
addresses that the person or

168
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,479
organization can have with ipv6

169
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
is it even possible to make network

170
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,319
recons

171
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
reconnaissance uh in ipv6 networks

172
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,280
so at some point yes and in that part of

173
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
my presentation i want to show you some

174
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,759
ways to do that

175
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,960
first of all first of all patterns

176
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,280
actually they are used in infrastructure

177
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,319
networks to

178
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,599
simplify the management so it can be

179
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,800
easy to remember

180
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,199
the addresses and it can be easier to

181
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,800
manage them

182
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,360
and first pattern it can be a little low

183
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,560
byte addresses

184
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,599
in which most of the bytes are set to

185
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,160
zero

186
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,199
except uh significant one

187
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,720
um second is ipv6 based addresses

188
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,120
i know it looks weird but that exists

189
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
and we need to

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
deal with that uh and that addresses in

191
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,919
which

192
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,680
the ipv4 address is embedded in ipv6

193
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,240
address the next pattern can be the

194
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
service port addresses it's actually

195
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
uh basically like a low byte addresses

196
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
but instead of the

197
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,560
significant last byte we can use

198
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,319
the number of tcp or udp port of the

199
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,519
main service that is running on the host

200
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,039
and we can use actually the word

201
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,440
addresses just embedded the word in the

202
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,519
ipv6 address but the word has

203
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,839
its own limit because in hexadecimal

204
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,880
in hexadecimal there is only um

205
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,839
there is usage only from a to f

206
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,200
letters so what about techniques

207
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,760
uh if we're talking about local network

208
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,360
uh the following techniques

209
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,000
uh was found to be effective and i'll

210
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,399
cover

211
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,279
a bit later uh local address scanning

212
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,040
and traffic snooping or

213
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
sniffing on the other hand

214
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
if the target is a remote network the

215
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,519
following techniques

216
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,480
may be used and i'm going to describe in

217
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,519
more details

218
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,480
remote address scanning dns brute

219
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,760
forcing or

220
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
and dns reverse mappings

221
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,959
so what about dns brute force and

222
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,440
actually it's the easiest one

223
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,680
attackers may employ dns brute forcing

224
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,480
techniques

225
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,399
just by looking for dns quad a records

226
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,640
against commonly used host names

227
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,839
and nmop has an amazing feature called

228
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,800
nmap engine and map script engine so you

229
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
can just download the script that's

230
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,680
called dnsbrood

231
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
uh from the official map website and use

232
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
it with map to

233
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,120
try yourself indiana's brute force

234
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,160
um what about interesting uh what is

235
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,120
most

236
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
interesting about this technique dns

237
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,320
reverse mappings

238
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,040
is that it can greatly reduce

239
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,800
the ipv6 address search space

240
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,079
basically an attacker walks through

241
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
ip6 airporzone dns

242
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,000
zone corresponding to a target network

243
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,519
issuing queries for ptr records

244
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
corresponding to to the domain name and

245
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:34,959
uh

246
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,959
if there were ptr records for um

247
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,880
for any host starting with the domain

248
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
name uh the response would contain the

249
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,399
code of zero or

250
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,800
no error and otherwise the response

251
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,839
would contain

252
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,720
the code of four

253
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,320
you can try ptr scan actually

254
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,120
within map too and there is just another

255
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,079
script

256
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,120
called dns ip6 airbuscan

257
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,399
or you can just use some web tools for

258
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,279
example this

259
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,240
this is the reverse reverse dns tool

260
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,880
from network tools

261
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,200
address scanning remote address scanning

262
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
um before

263
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,040
remote edge scanning uh you should

264
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,920
consider

265
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,519
which subnet prefix to choose because

266
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,560
actually a typical site might have

267
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,560
a 48 or 64 subnets to be scanned

268
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,760
and however we can reduce

269
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,120
the search space by like guessing

270
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,240
likely plansky address plan schemes

271
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,200
or using any clues that might exist from

272
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,000
your

273
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,040
searches or from other sources sources

274
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,000
or

275
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,399
observations and for example there are a

276
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,680
number of

277
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
documents available available online

278
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,720
like

279
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,760
rfc 5375 that

280
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,880
can provide some recommendations

281
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,000
for the allocation of address space

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
and address plans might inc

283
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
might include um addresses that

284
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,600
for example run from low number upwards

285
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,040
uh use building numbers in hexadecimal

286
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,800
or decimal form

287
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,839
and use even vlan numbers

288
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,279
however the scale of address scanning

289
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:29,839
tasks

290
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,720
is so large in ipv6 so that attackers

291
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,600
must be very creative to be to be good

292
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,320
enough

293
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,600
and simply sweeping an entire 64

294
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,720
subnet mask in ipv6 uh would just be

295
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,720
impossible um there is a tool

296
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,399
from from ipv6 to kit

297
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,680
uh it called uh it called scan6 and

298
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,720
it actually supports a sweeping address

299
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,279
range

300
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,320
ranges and can also use um all the

301
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
address patterns

302
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,600
so and this tool actually can be found

303
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,560
uh in default repositories uh on debian

304
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
based systems

305
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,200
and i check only debian ones sorry

306
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
what about local networks firstly we can

307
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,800
try

308
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
to obtain information via traffic

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,399
snooping or traffic sniffing

310
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
this can help in discovering active

311
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,600
hosts

312
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,839
in a number of ways for example uh

313
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,720
each captured packet uh of course we

314
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,839
will reveal um

315
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,120
the source and destination of the packet

316
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,160
and secondly the capture network traffic

317
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,079
may correspond to network protocols

318
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,360
that transfer information such as host

319
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,079
or

320
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,639
router addresses network topology

321
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,320
information

322
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,399
and so on um

323
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,839
local address scheduling ipv6

324
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,440
address scanning in um local networks

325
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
could be considered to some extent

326
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
um a completely different problem

327
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,600
uh the scan in a remote uh ipv6 network

328
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,959
and the main difference uh is that

329
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,240
use of linux local multicast addresses

330
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
can relieve can actually relieve

331
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,720
the attacker of searching for unicast

332
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,360
addresses

333
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,199
in large ipv6 address space

334
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,480
for example an attacker can simply send

335
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,000
pro packets to

336
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,880
the all nodes link local multicast

337
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,959
address

338
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,000
and get a reply from all

339
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,680
active hosts in a network and this

340
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
but want to emphasize that this can help

341
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,680
with discovering

342
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,160
only link local addresses

343
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,160
also there are a variety of publicly

344
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,360
available local ipv6 networks

345
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
address scanners and for example even

346
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
current versions of nmop

347
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,600
implement this functionality and there

348
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,120
is another toolkit

349
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,320
called thc ipv6 and it contains

350
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,920
a tool called alive6 that implements

351
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,040
this functionality too and also

352
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,560
this toolkit can be found in

353
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,800
repositories for debian based systems

354
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,800
what about mitigations a pv6 address

355
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,440
scanning

356
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,720
attacks can be mitigated in a number of

357
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,000
ways for example

358
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,839
first that you can do is just to limit

359
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,279
pattern addresses

360
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,480
uh the second you can employ a

361
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,920
ips system in your environment

362
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,519
uh you can enforce ipv6 packet filtering

363
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,279
where it's possible you can try to avoid

364
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,199
use of sequentially addresses with your

365
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,040
dhcp and actually ideally that dhcp

366
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,360
server would allocate random addresses

367
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,600
from um a large pool and that's it

368
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,759
um actually you can use

369
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,040
um what else you can use is to use the

370
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,720
default 64 size ipv6 subnet prefix just

371
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,440
to

372
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,880
uh make life harder for attackers

373
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,320
and uh in general you can just avoid

374
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,519
being predictable

375
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,600
uh in the way addresses are assigned

376
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,120
what about block listing ipv6 hosts are

377
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,839
generally

378
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,279
able to configure any number of ipv6

379
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,800
addresses within

380
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
their 64 local subnet and

381
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,759
actually in the event of malicious

382
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,120
activity

383
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,959
uh you should block list at least the 64

384
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,279
subnet from which you may have detected

385
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,880
malicious activity

386
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,519
and depending on the specific internet

387
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,880
provider

388
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,280
the attacker might have control of

389
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,400
prefixes

390
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,599
of any lens between 48

391
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,280
and 64. so if malicious activity

392
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,640
persists after block uh

393
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,760
block list in the offending 64 subnet

394
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,919
you may want to block shorter prefixes

395
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,520
that means that you can block

396
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,799
uh the larger the larger blocks

397
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,480
of addresses okay

398
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,799
so what uh what else you should do or

399
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,679
you should know

400
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,240
while securing yourself or organization

401
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,720
uh

402
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,640
well knowing the syntax makes it much

403
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,760
easier to quickly know how to deal with

404
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,679
a security breach for example or

405
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,280
implement necessary measures

406
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,200
shutting off ipv6 capabilities when you

407
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,760
are

408
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,960
when you are not using it may seem

409
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,760
obvious

410
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,039
but it made it may not be that um

411
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,240
easy because a number of uh programs

412
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,960
have already been configured was to work

413
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
with ipv6

414
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,679
and um just as many may already be

415
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,760
already have the protocol turned on

416
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
automatically by default

417
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,240
so what i mean that you you need to

418
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,880
check

419
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,200
um double check triple check your

420
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,000
environment

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,120
uh to ensure that ipv6 is enabled only

422
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,840
when it is used

423
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,840
even with the large portions of network

424
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,720
disabled

425
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,919
for ipv6 there is still the threat

426
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,120
of unwanted ipv6 visitors

427
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,840
and when that happens organizations

428
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,240
should

429
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,880
know how to organize should know how to

430
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
kill it before it can infect

431
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,919
others in the network and there is

432
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,559
actually knowing the ipv6 address

433
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,160
ipv6 syntax can be useful particular

434
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,760
particularly for setting up

435
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,640
effective firewalls and traffic filters

436
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,880
so my last question is um what continued

437
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,760
ipv6 adoption means for internet

438
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,679
security

439
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,880
hackers actually tend to set their

440
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,720
sights on new targets only when

441
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,960
they become foresee of their attention

442
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,320
and the same goes for ipv6 as ipv6

443
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,440
adoption becomes

444
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,640
more prevalent uh threat actors are

445
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,799
increasingly using its addresses as an

446
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,360
attack vector

447
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,160
and for example if um if threat

448
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,039
intelligence

449
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,799
feeds haven't prepared to analyze

450
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,400
ipv6 addresses they they actually

451
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
they faced with big uh with big black

452
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,760
holes

453
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,880
in the data sets and the ability

454
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,679
uh and the main point here uh for me

455
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,240
that

456
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,960
the ability to monitor an ambulance web

457
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,640
traffic is actually a key

458
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,840
to detecting a bridge

459
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,440
so speaking of security device producers

460
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,559
should also

461
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,600
be aware of ipv6 adoption and this is

462
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,559
especially true for iot devices the

463
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,440
amount of

464
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,320
internet connected iot devices grows

465
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,840
exponentially and

466
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,360
uh millions of new ips ap addresses will

467
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,159
be needed

468
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,480
and ipv6 will help with that of course

469
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,280
but

470
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,000
manufacturers should make sure that

471
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
their devices

472
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,159
are designed with the capabilities to

473
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,039
support

474
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,559
analyze and actually secure it

475
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,039
and in conclusion i just want to say

476
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
that ipv6 may have

477
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,360
may have been a long time coming but

478
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,720
it's too late in the game to ignore

479
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,200
uh on that slide you can see the links

480
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,640
and tools that you might have

481
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
missed and also where you can find me

482
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,000
and i just want to add that

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,400
in case of cyber security if you are

484
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,760
confused or

485
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,000
you don't have a person you can contact

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,039
or you're unsure

487
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,360
or embarrassed to contact someone you

488
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,760
can contact me without hesitation

489
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,480
i'm i'm always glad to learn by helping

490
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:16,960
people

491
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,799
and resolving some interesting cases

492
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,159
and i'm ready for your questions awesome

493
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,200
um we do have a few questions

494
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,480
um the first one being well relating to

495
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,720
of course the adoption of ipv6 versus

496
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,880
ipv4

497
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,240
why does do so many people still use

498
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,400
ipv4 as a default

499
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,080
considering all of the security

500
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,720
implementations of ipv6

501
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,440
uh well the first reason is for me

502
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,080
because

503
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,600
uh people are just they just get used

504
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,760
uh they they are used to use ipv4

505
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,280
and uh it looks easier

506
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,919
to uh set up and it looks easier and it

507
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,039
seems easier to

508
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,240
for example have

509
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,559
it looks easier to to

510
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,080
uh like set your firewalls because

511
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,120
as i've already said that uh if we have

512
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,480
a net translate net uh we can just uh

513
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,280
set up a firewall on your router for uh

514
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,240
one ip

515
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,280
of like the outgoing ap and

516
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,880
with ipv6 uh it may be harder because uh

517
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,240
if you do not have uh like firewall in

518
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,039
your router

519
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,799
it just mean that you need to set up

520
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,360
some security some security settings on

521
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,639
each device that you have

522
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,520
yeah i i hope yeah

523
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,240
and then um what tools are important to

524
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,799
know for ivp p6 all right ipv6

525
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,440
sorry uh tools

526
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,440
actually uh if you set up in ipv6

527
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,799
like in your own environment or in your

528
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,919
own device uh it's

529
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,520
it's not different with from ipv4

530
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,720
so you just need to know how how to uh

531
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
how to set up a network on your device

532
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,760
it just

533
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,559
just did and the main difference is just

534
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:22,799
the

535
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,200
the numbers and the the amount of the

536
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,919
numbers

537
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,039
and that's all but

538
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,200
i want to add that for example if you

539
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,960
want to implement the ipv6 from

540
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,159
hurricane electrics

541
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,159
they have the instructions the

542
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,280
instructors for

543
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,760
implemented on your device nevertheless

544
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,600
like from your

545
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,120
independently from your device that you

546
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,640
use for example they have instructions

547
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,279
for

548
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,000
mac os windows uh and for the routers

549
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,320
with

550
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,520
for example cisco i also my critique

551
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,720
awesome um well considering

552
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,480
you know that botnets exists

553
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,919
uh across the internet uh nowadays

554
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,279
uh do you think it would be possible for

555
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,960
botnets to adapt

556
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
to using ipv6 scanning uh for mass host

557
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
recruitment

558
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,159
oh it's it's it's quite hard action is

559
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,520
actually because um yeah

560
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,600
the the amount of ipv6 addresses that

561
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,880
could be implemented it's

562
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,000
really impressive and uh it it it would

563
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,039
be easier to

564
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,080
set up submarines botnets of course

565
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,640
um but um i don't know i i i never deep

566
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,080
dived in

567
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,640
in the same or in the subject of like

568
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,360
abutments with ipv6 but it's actually a

569
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,559
very interesting question

570
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,080
great answer and how do you combine nat

571
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,520
with ipv6

572
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,720
where's the file uh actually net

573
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,240
uh it's not a requirement for ipv6

574
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,400
and when you have ipv6 you don't need an

575
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,559
ad at all but there is a functionality

576
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,320
that called net 64.

577
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,080
and that doesn't mean that you can

578
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,360
implement like

579
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,120
private ip6 uh like make a net with

580
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,360
private ipv6 addresses and

581
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,400
um publicly ipv6 addresses

582
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,919
net 64 is actually uh designed for

583
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,760
uh may for getting used to

584
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,600
ipv6 so net 64 is actually for

585
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,120
uh translated your ipv4 address

586
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,400
to ipv6 and it's actually quite

587
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,430
like difficult uh technique

588
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,679
[Laughter]

589
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,880
but it it exists yeah

590
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,039
awesome thank you so much you had such a

591
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,200
fantastic implementation so

592
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,039
thank you for being here with us and

593
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,279
thank you i was really enjoying the

594
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,440
the conference yeah you've gotten a lot

595
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,640
of positive feedback in the youtube

596
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,200
comments

597
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,080
oh that's so awesome thank you yeah
