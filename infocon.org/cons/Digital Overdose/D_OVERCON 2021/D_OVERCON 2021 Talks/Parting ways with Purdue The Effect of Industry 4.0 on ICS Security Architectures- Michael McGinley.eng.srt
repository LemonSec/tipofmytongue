1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,040
hey good morning

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,760
uh glad to be here with you my name is

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,960
michael mcginley

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,880
and today i'm going to be talking about

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,040
the effect of industry 4.0

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
on industrial control system security

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,320
architectures

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,920
now some of you may already be familiar

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600
with industrial control system

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
and some of you may have no idea of the

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,840
concept whatsoever so regardless of your

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,960
experience

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,320
i'm hoping you can learn something from

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
this talk

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
let's get started

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,719
so first of all we're going to explore

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
the security issues in ics

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,559
and what makes them different from it

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,320
systems in these regards

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,680
looking at architectures such as the

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,120
purple model which you can see on the

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
right of the screen there

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,719
and we'll also examine proposed

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,640
solutions to creating secure

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,800
architecture for industry 4.0

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,840
and industrial internet of things

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,000
technology

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,280
before we get started just a quick

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,120
overview about myself

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,719
i'm michael mcginley i'm a cyber

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,319
security analyst

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,560
i studied at glasgow university for five

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,240
years and gained my master's in

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,400
computing science last year

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,080
and in my final years when i developed a

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,920
keen interest in industrial control

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,799
systems

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,840
and particularly the security of these

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,119
which is somewhat of a niche part of

40
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,400
cyber security or at least it used to be

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,759
when a lot of people think about cyber

42
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,520
security they tend to think more about

43
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,000
personal

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,360
computers financial crime data loss

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,640
but in recent years there have been a

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
number of high-profile security

47
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,960
incidents

48
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,320
in the industrial sector such incidents

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,479
have the potential to be catastrophic

50
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,240
and when you think about the criticality

51
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,759
of industrial networks

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,280
and the systems which are connected to

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,079
them in sectors such as oil and gas

54
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,280
civil nuclear and aerospace having a

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
trusted architecture

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,399
to guide the implementation and security

57
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,640
of the systems involved

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,560
is really really important because we've

59
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,079
seen operational technology

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
and information technology converge in

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,560
recent years

62
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,960
so in this talk i'm going to give a

63
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,239
broad overview of what industrial

64
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,199
control systems are

65
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,760
what makes them special we'll look at

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,360
the devices which are typically found in

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
these systems

68
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
what their purpose is and what security

69
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,400
for them looks like

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,599
we're then going to talk about what the

71
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
future of ics looks like

72
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,480
with industry 4.0 and how industrial

73
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,760
internet of things technology is

74
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,879
revolutionizing these systems

75
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,160
we'll look at the purdue enterprise

76
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,000
reference architecture which is sort of

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
a standard model

78
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
for mapping out ics or at least it has

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,440
been for quite some time

80
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,480
and we'll then have a look at what the

81
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,640
common issues for securing ics are

82
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,120
so both historically and more recent and

83
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,720
look at a couple of case studies

84
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,440
firstly the 2015 black energy 3 attack

85
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
on ukraine power grid

86
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,200
and also the more recent security

87
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
incident at oldsmar water treatment

88
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,440
facility in florida

89
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,800
we'll use the model to map out these

90
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,720
attacks and visualize the stages that

91
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,640
took place

92
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,239
after this we'll discuss what the issues

93
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,080
are with the standard purdue model

94
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,879
in the context of modern systems and i

95
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,879
suppose why the strict segmentation may

96
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,159
be inappropriate

97
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,519
now that we have devices connected to

98
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,000
the cloud

99
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
after this we'll look at some of the

100
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,239
options that have been discussed for

101
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,440
making new architectures

102
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
or adapting existing ones to industry

103
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
4.0

104
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
and finally get a summary of these and

105
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,440
discuss the validity of the purdue model

106
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,080
going forward so let's jump right in

107
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,920
what are industrial control systems well

108
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,840
with industrial control systems you may

109
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,519
also also hear terms such as

110
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,720
operational technology ics which is

111
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,360
industrial control systems and scada

112
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
but they do have different meanings

113
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,640
operational technology

114
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,799
is kind of the overarching term and that

115
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
is just as it says on the tin

116
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,920
it's technology which allows people to

117
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,720
manage industrial operations

118
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,599
industrial control systems well these

119
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,879
are the systems which are used to

120
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,879
monitor and control the processes

121
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
for example the robotic arms

122
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,959
manufacturing lines safety systems

123
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,720
valve controls scada

124
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,799
is really the software which allows the

125
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,000
operators to monitor

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,320
the running processes and provides

127
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,358
access to the control functionality

128
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,000
well traditionally you might find scada

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
software installed on machines in a

130
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
control room

131
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
in recent years we've seen operational

132
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,320
technology

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,120
and ics networks move to much larger

134
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
geographical areas

135
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,040
so you might now have scada software

136
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
which is

137
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
controlling devices across many many

138
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,280
males

139
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,479
in different plants it's not a new

140
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,040
concept

141
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,560
ics it's been around since the 1950s and

142
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
they're always getting more complex and

143
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
distributed across larger areas

144
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,759
as years have gone on

145
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
so before we move in and talk about ics

146
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
in more detail

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,039
what are the common devices what kind of

148
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
things do people talk about when they

149
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,000
they talk about ics so the main thing

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,759
if you have any knowledge of ics the

151
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,039
main thing that people talk about are

152
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,080
plc's

153
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,440
programmable logic controllers these are

154
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
industrial computers which

155
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,199
they take inputs from sensors or input

156
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,240
devices

157
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,759
and they just process their state and

158
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,479
they trigger output quite simple

159
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,479
they are ruggedized so they're designed

160
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,400
to withstand harsher environments than

161
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,759
standard computers

162
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,440
so the kind of environments you might

163
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,759
find within industrial plants

164
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,120
eg high operating temperatures

165
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
often these will be programmed with

166
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,680
ladder logic or structured text

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,800
you don't need to know too much about

168
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
those but those are kind of the two

169
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,440
standard

170
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,320
programming languages

171
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,440
similar to plc's we also have remote

172
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,840
terminal units

173
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
um they perform a similar functionality

174
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,680
but their main purpose

175
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,759
is for communication of the process

176
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,319
state back to the scada systems

177
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,520
with some element of control too they're

178
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
often more distributed

179
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,560
than plcs and may use wireless

180
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
communication that's not to say that

181
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,560
plcs themselves you wouldn't find them

182
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,479
using wireless communication

183
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,840
but at the same time it's just a general

184
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,759
trend that rtus tend to be a bit more

185
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,199
spread out and wireless

186
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,319
you might find rtus at the top of a

187
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,240
telephone pylon or an electric

188
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,680
substation to allow the electricity

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,199
companies to monitor the state of the

190
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,520
process

191
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,600
we also have human machine interfaces so

192
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,199
these are basically just screens

193
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,919
um it can be touch screen they can just

194
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,120
have buttons

195
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,319
and you either find them next to the

196
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,919
process so if you think about someone

197
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,600
working in a plan

198
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,160
you'll find a screen maybe while the

199
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,840
operator is trying to control a conveyor

200
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
belt and it shows them the status of

201
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:49,919
that

202
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,759
and they can stop it they can see see

203
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,840
what's going on or they can make changes

204
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,199
to it

205
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,120
but you also might find hmi software

206
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
running on a desktop machine in the

207
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
control room

208
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,720
alongside the scada software and the

209
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
scada software

210
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,800
will have the hmi functionality built in

211
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
but it may also have the

212
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,880
opportunity to allow the operators to

213
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,400
reprogram the plc's

214
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,880
and issue firmware updates

215
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,919
so what's what's industry 4.0 what's

216
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,280
and what is the industrial internet of

217
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,479
things um

218
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,639
this is a good quote i think which kind

219
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,680
of summed up

220
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
and angela merkel said it's the fusion

221
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,440
of the online world

222
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,960
and the world of industrial production

223
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,599
and it's all to do with processes

224
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,440
becoming smarter so

225
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
like smartphones smart homes smart voice

226
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,960
assistants

227
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
factories to another latest area to get

228
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
the smart treatment

229
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,759
industry 4.0 and industrial internet of

230
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,599
things go hand in hand

231
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,919
because it's the iot devices that enable

232
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,319
the greater interconnection

233
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,000
interconnection sorry and data

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
collection than traditional systems

235
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
so we have work called cyber physical

236
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,319
systems which is a pretty

237
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,759
straightforward concept

238
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,319
it's the blend of cyber and physical

239
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,080
where we would previously have had basic

240
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,720
sensors

241
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,360
and actuators connected to simple plcs

242
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,879
which may feed their data up towards

243
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,080
scada systems

244
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,720
historians and enterprise networks we

245
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,240
now have the data processing being done

246
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,759
within the device itself

247
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,599
or near to it and so this increased data

248
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,720
collection

249
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,199
it brings with all kinds of benefits for

250
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,160
efficiency

251
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
such as faster batch changeovers

252
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,159
automatic track and trace automated

253
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,839
reporting

254
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,080
and in theory businesses should also see

255
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,279
reduced running costs

256
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,760
through reduced waste fewer quality

257
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,720
issues

258
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,000
and better use of resources

259
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
the data can be fed directly into supply

260
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,080
chain networks so as to predict stock

261
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,360
requirements

262
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,959
and systems can be remotely controlled

263
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,120
or managed

264
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,160
so this all sounds great right

265
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
well we know that greater

266
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,440
interconnectivity

267
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
creates more attack vectors and more

268
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,640
security challenges where security

269
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
administrators would previously

270
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,959
have a lockdown control network which is

271
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,200
air gap from the internet

272
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
we now have control devices connecting

273
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,160
to internet networks

274
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
systems that would previously have been

275
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,839
in silos are now required to connect

276
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,600
each other

277
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,040
or at least have common connection to

278
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,920
log storage systems

279
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,240
to combat this we need to have robust

280
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,160
security plans in place

281
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
from the beginning of any iiot

282
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
implementation

283
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
rather than jumping to integrate and

284
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
make use of this exciting new technology

285
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
and then think about adding on security

286
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,240
later

287
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,680
particularly with critical

288
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
infrastructure so critical

289
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,000
infrastructure

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,800
is like your oil and gas nuclear sector

291
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,399
it will take some time before the

292
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,920
infrastructure owners and the

293
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,279
governments involved

294
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,240
become comfortable with this technology

295
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
so we're also going to talk about purdue

296
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
enterprise reference architecture

297
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
which like i said is a model for mapping

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
out the systems

299
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,200
and it segments the system into six

300
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,120
levels zero to five

301
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,560
each of which has its own specific

302
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,200
purpose this helps to isolate the

303
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,519
control zones from the enterprise zones

304
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,040
and therefore reduces the risk of

305
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
attacks

306
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,279
level 4 and 5 these are your highest

307
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,240
levels

308
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,920
and they focus on enterprise technology

309
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
and systems

310
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,399
common systems include web servers mail

311
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,240
servers enterprise workstations

312
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,079
which you might find at these levels

313
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,680
this is the kind of corporate level

314
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,399
network

315
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,160
far removed from the planet itself

316
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,920
then between levels four and three we

317
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
have the demilitarized zone

318
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,480
so this resides between two firewalls

319
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,160
and often includes remote access servers

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
level threes and manufacturing

321
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,839
operations and that's where you have

322
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:00,720
historians

323
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,480
and overall monitoring systems level two

324
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
is the control systems where we'd find

325
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,079
scada and hmis

326
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,279
and level one is the plcs and rtus and

327
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,560
they're connected directly to the

328
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,839
process which is level zero

329
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,480
in some situations you may also find

330
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,600
this safety zone

331
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,800
which you can see at the bottom of the

332
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
chart and that's where the

333
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,000
safety critical processes are so this is

334
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,760
where you've got um

335
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,320
systems that would automatically trigger

336
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,279
the

337
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,320
the operation to stop uh given

338
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,640
an exact like if the electricity went

339
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,839
through ah

340
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,600
over the threshold or an operator press

341
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
the reset button

342
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,640
these should be as separated as possible

343
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,320
from the enterprise network

344
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
and ideally air gapped so that's why

345
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
they're right at the bottom

346
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,959
of the the architecture

347
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
this is a bit more of an in-depth view

348
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,200
of it and the kind of devices that you

349
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
might see

350
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,079
um you'll also see i have the firewalls

351
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,279
situated between

352
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,959
levels four the demilitarized zone

353
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,560
and level three um

354
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,839
and this is kind of a good overview of

355
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,279
the kind of devices that you might find

356
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,920
in each level

357
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,040
so why do we need to secure ics

358
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680
well hopefully the answer to that is

359
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,360
pretty self-explanatory

360
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,160
but there are also some common issues

361
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,920
which you get from securing ics

362
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,200
and so in an ics environment the typical

363
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
enterprise i t doesn't work

364
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,959
you can't just have the same cyber

365
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,800
security team

366
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,600
in charge of both your it and your ot

367
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,079
networks

368
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
there's a couple of common security

369
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,399
issues

370
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,800
with ics um firstly

371
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,920
in it availability

372
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,040
isn't as so important as it is in ot

373
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
if you have downtime in ot uh it can be

374
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
extremely really

375
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
costly and also dangerous sometimes

376
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,519
particularly if it's a safety system

377
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,959
furthermore um a lot of the systems also

378
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,399
have legacy systems still built in and

379
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,519
the plants have been commissioned

380
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,480
many many years beforehand and will

381
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,320
still be operating for at least say 20

382
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,839
years

383
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,720
and for this reason you have older

384
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,240
operating systems running within the

385
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
factory environments

386
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,639
such as windows 7 or even older

387
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,240
it's not cost effective or

388
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
even safe sometimes to upgrade or patch

389
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
these systems because you don't know

390
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,959
what it's going to do to the underlying

391
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,760
process

392
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,560
having said that like i said having

393
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,240
windows 7 and windows xp

394
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
and other commercial off the shelf

395
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,399
systems involved

396
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,680
this is where you can get

397
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,519
vulnerabilities in place

398
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,720
and if you don't patch them then

399
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
you've got a big problem and you

400
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,560
probably need to air gap them as best to

401
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,680
your ability if you're not going to

402
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,079
patch them

403
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,000
i think misconfiguration is also one of

404
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,519
the main issues um

405
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,120
having a lack of firewalls of the

406
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,959
fireballs misconfigured or routers

407
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,480
misconfigured

408
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
would allow systems which are not

409
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,480
normally uh permitted to connect to the

410
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,199
internet

411
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,240
being directly connected so there's an

412
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,320
internet of things search engine called

413
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,600
showdown

414
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,560
and on there is where you might find um

415
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,320
examples of industrial control systems

416
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,519
which have been misconfigured

417
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,120
or are connected to the internet

418
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,639
now this demand for internet

419
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,480
connectivity has been accelerated by the

420
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,880
pandemic in the last year

421
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,399
and for this reason if corporations

422
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,000
haven't properly thought out

423
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,440
how they want their people working from

424
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,519
home you might have

425
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,920
insecure implementations of remote

426
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,399
access software

427
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,320
which we'll go into in a minute a bit

428
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,720
further

429
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,399
one of the other main issues is that

430
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,320
many of the communication protocols used

431
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,760
are insecure

432
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,680
so when i said that ics has been around

433
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,920
since the 1950s

434
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,320
um there are protocols that have been

435
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,079
around since the 70s

436
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,839
which have absolutely no encryption

437
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,279
and no checking of who has sent the data

438
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,320
and where so if you have a plc

439
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
which uses modbus chances are

440
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,560
um if an attacker got into your network

441
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
they could send specially crafted modbus

442
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,360
packets

443
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,839
to make the plc do whatever it wanted or

444
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,680
start or stop the process

445
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,519
this is extremely dangerous as you can

446
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,920
imagine

447
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,959
so what does a typical ics attack flow

448
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,480
look like

449
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,279
um what's the kind of chain of what

450
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,839
attackers like to do

451
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,920
well firstly they'll gain access to the

452
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,519
corporate enterprise network

453
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,040
that's usually how these attacks go um

454
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,800
usually there's a vulnerability either

455
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
in an enterprise system

456
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
or it's part of a phishing attack

457
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,040
against the corporate users

458
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
from there they'll pivot around have a

459
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,440
look and see where they can go

460
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,920
extend their foothold there and find

461
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,720
some devices

462
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,959
which could potentially give them access

463
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,759
to the lower down levels

464
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,680
if they're able to do that they can gain

465
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,279
access to the control network

466
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,279
install malware and disrupt the

467
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,839
processes

468
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
so quickly we'll look at the the 2015

469
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,560
black energy attack

470
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,680
on ukraine's power grid so like the

471
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,920
previous example the previous slide

472
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,480
this is a top-down attack the attackers

473
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,560
got access to the enterprise zone

474
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,639
still vpn credentials from there and

475
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,920
then moved downward to attack the

476
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,600
control zones

477
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
and it ended up that 225 thousand

478
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,320
customers without power

479
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,120
the hmis were what were targeted and

480
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,079
they ended up

481
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,399
modifying circuit breakers without the

482
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,359
operator input

483
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,520
post incident analysis showed that the

484
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,559
attack

485
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,160
probably came from a spear phishing

486
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,839
campaign

487
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,919
which meant that the corporate

488
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,280
workstations were infected with the

489
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
black energy 3 malware

490
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
from there the attackers found vpn

491
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,439
credentials which allowed them to get

492
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,280
into the control network

493
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,400
they disrupted the scada systems

494
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
and disabled the uninterruptible power

495
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,080
supplies which meant that things went

496
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
wrong which they did

497
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,480
and everyone was a power or 225 cost

498
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,679
thousand customers anyway

499
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,080
so here's a kind of overview of how that

500
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,280
that worked

501
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,160
step one they target the enterprise uh

502
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,320
the enterprise desktops

503
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,360
they then pivoted around found vpn

504
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,960
credentials on an active directory

505
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,240
server

506
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,799
and then used that from to go from their

507
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,720
same external network

508
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,400
to attack the remote access server

509
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,880
and from there there was a misconfigured

510
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,600
router

511
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
which allowed them access to the scada

512
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,678
systems

513
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,320
not all attacks have to be this

514
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,080
sophisticated though

515
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,880
and in the case of the attack recently

516
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,760
this year

517
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
on the florida old smart water treatment

518
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,280
facility

519
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,200
um this was a very low sophistication

520
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
attack and involved the use of

521
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,799
teamviewer

522
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,919
now you could talk for a long time about

523
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,640
how

524
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
teamviewer is not a secure system for

525
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
using remote access particularly in

526
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,120
corporate and industrial control systems

527
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,679
but um in this case yeah this very bad

528
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
practice

529
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,080
the the there was a leak called the comb

530
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,200
leak or comb leak

531
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,320
in february 2021 which was 3.2 billion

532
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,000
email password pairs

533
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
and it was described as the biggest

534
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,440
breach of all time

535
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
three days later an attacker remotely

536
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,280
accessed a machine

537
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
which had teamviewer installed alongside

538
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,760
the hmi software

539
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,160
the attacker wasn't very sophisticated

540
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,799
and it seemed as if they decided to just

541
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,360
manually change the ph levels from what

542
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,039
would be a normal operating level

543
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,840
way up to something which is completely

544
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,320
uh

545
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,000
completely unnormal and unacceptable

546
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,919
now luckily one of the operators that

547
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,039
was working there

548
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,240
i spotted it within a few hours or at

549
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,400
least at the end of the day

550
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
and um it was quite very rectified

551
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,200
without affecting any customers

552
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,440
now it's quite possible that the reason

553
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
that teamviewer was on this system

554
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
is because of a bad response to the the

555
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,799
working from home situation with the

556
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,400
pandemic

557
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,200
um and if you don't think about how

558
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,799
remote access will work before just

559
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,160
installing things

560
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,840
then you're gonna have some poor

561
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,120
implementations

562
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,360
so like i said it's very low

563
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,440
sophistication that not all attacks have

564
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,919
to come

565
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,520
from the highest levels and go all the

566
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
way down if it's misconfigured

567
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,799
enough you can get direct access to the

568
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,640
control networks

569
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,679
now luckily no one was injured in this

570
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,880
attack but

571
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,000
if the attacker had been more

572
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,159
sophisticated um

573
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,720
maybe they would have been able to hide

574
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,679
their actions better

575
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,200
and we may not have known about this

576
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,840
until it was too late

577
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,440
so we've talked about the purdue model

578
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,679
and we've talked about industry 4.0

579
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,880
so there is one main issue with using

580
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,840
the purdue model

581
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,679
and its segmentation for industry 4.0

582
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,120
and industrial internet of things

583
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,640
and it's the industry 4.0 has this

584
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
reliance on interconnectivity

585
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,720
and sensors connecting from the end from

586
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,320
the internet networks at the top

587
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,600
uh directly to them at the sensor level

588
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,360
so we don't have this hierarchical data

589
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,720
flow anymore you don't have your

590
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,760
corporate at the top

591
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,320
and then down each level uh to the

592
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,600
control network and in the control

593
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,200
network not being able to access the

594
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,039
internet at least without having to go

595
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,760
through

596
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,120
all the different layers so there's more

597
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,320
opportunities for attack

598
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,000
if you're going to have this lack of

599
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
separation

600
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,520
the data that's gathered are processed

601
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,280
at level one and level zero

602
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,520
sent directly to the cloud it bypasses

603
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,039
the logical hierarchy of the purdue

604
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,480
model

605
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,960
and even if you were to make some sort

606
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
of system where

607
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
you wanted your devices at level zero to

608
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,080
send data up to the cloud

609
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,640
through the corporate network the amount

610
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,600
of overheads

611
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,880
and the amount of time that this would

612
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
take adding on would really decrease

613
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,240
your efficiency

614
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,280
and might actually increase

615
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,480
opportunities for exposure

616
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,640
so this is a kind of simplified overview

617
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,240
of the two different models

618
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,640
we have the purdue model on the left and

619
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,360
we have

620
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,559
the iot cloud model on the right it's a

621
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,480
very simplified version but

622
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,320
essentially we have both the cloud and

623
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,679
the edge

624
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
networks and everything that's in the

625
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,440
edge will connect through an edge

626
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,400
gateway

627
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,039
to the cloud

628
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,039
so in that case is produced irrelevant

629
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,640
if you're not going to have this strict

630
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,480
segmentation between

631
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,240
each level of the network what happens

632
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,400
well as the architectures bypass

633
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,120
traditional hierarchical levels

634
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,440
um it could be said that purdue is

635
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,919
outdated

636
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,840
when we think about security of course

637
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,919
the issue of ot and it converging isn't

638
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,200
new

639
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,720
and as we have seen most incidents seem

640
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,080
to be a result of misconfiguration

641
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,200
however iot environments this edge

642
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,840
gateway

643
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,200
which connects the cloud and the edge

644
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,120
networks would be the most critical

645
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,799
component to secure

646
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,240
and surely a breach of this could be

647
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,840
catastrophic

648
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,600
particularly if a business has opted to

649
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,280
use iiot devices

650
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,640
for safety critical applications

651
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,320
so we move away from the purdue model

652
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,240
then what happens well

653
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,559
we might be presented with more concerns

654
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,720
because the model is so successful

655
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,240
the level of trust the enterprises have

656
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,120
given it is demonstrated by the success

657
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,039
and many businesses may be reluctant to

658
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,320
design their networks on new and

659
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,799
untested architectures

660
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,400
purdue is referenced within so many

661
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,919
standards

662
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,440
at least the main standards for ics

663
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,640
security such as the nest 882

664
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,880
standard which has long been the go-to

665
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,559
standard um

666
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,159
for it and ot systems

667
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,640
so if we move away from these trusted

668
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,760
architectures

669
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,280
we need to give even more thought to

670
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
cyber security in case there's any

671
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,158
misconfiguration

672
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,919
and this will also take time to move

673
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,760
between industry 4.0

674
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,520
and iot the vast majority of traditional

675
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,039
control systems in use today

676
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,799
will not be decommissioned or radically

677
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,200
altered for many years

678
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,799
so if enterprises are looking to

679
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,559
integrate iiot

680
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,159
then some experts have suggested instead

681
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,919
of scrapping the purdue model we should

682
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,240
create a hybrid approach

683
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,840
and have an edge computing layer

684
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,600
somewhere between layers 2 and layer 3.

685
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,760
so how do we add that purdue model can

686
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,880
we adapt it

687
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,320
well yes one of the most promising

688
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,159
models is from the european union agency

689
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,559
for cyber security and that retains the

690
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,919
six level approach

691
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,799
for the purdue model we see the iiot

692
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,320
platform or edge gateway

693
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,640
situated at level 3 alongside

694
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,600
traditional systems such as a historian

695
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,039
level 5 in this instance has been

696
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,880
replaced with a cloud layer

697
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,919
and includes external cloud services

698
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,480
as well as bi-directional communication

699
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
with the sensors and actuators

700
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,600
from the iot platform of course in this

701
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
model you can't see the firewalls which

702
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
were present in the purdue model

703
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,799
or the traditional purdue model but

704
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,320
there will still be firewalls between

705
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
each of the layers

706
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
the whole document which it features in

707
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,919
is called good practices for security of

708
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,600
internet of things

709
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
um by the european union agency for

710
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,520
cyber security

711
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,279
and it's probably more beneficial for

712
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,000
industry 4.0 than past models

713
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,360
and it's much more relevant than some of

714
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,400
the older standards

715
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,159
i really recommend reading this

716
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,919
practices document if you're interested

717
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,520
in further implementation specifics

718
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,240
other um other proposals for security

719
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,640
if we move away from from strict

720
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
segmentation

721
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,720
are we need zero trust so like i said

722
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,200
with modbus and the protocols

723
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,440
uh if there's no there was implicit

724
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,039
trust by default

725
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,080
when ics were first made networked

726
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,799
and um this is obviously bad practice in

727
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,000
the modern age

728
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,279
because nobody back then was thinking

729
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,840
about cyber security but for now we need

730
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,760
we need the devices to be hardened by

731
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,880
default and

732
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,039
not trust each other unless it's

733
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,919
absolutely necessary

734
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,080
we also have next generation firewalls

735
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,000
which would provide enhanced logging and

736
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,679
threat detection

737
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,559
uh these are able to communicate with

738
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,320
asset management systems

739
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,200
and use deep packet inspection to

740
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,000
monitor

741
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,120
and provide businesses with an overview

742
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,520
of the assets which are within

743
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,919
their networks they also provide

744
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,600
information about vulnerabilities from

745
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,440
these assets

746
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,720
the data from this can be fed into

747
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,559
security tools

748
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,200
such as palo alto networks iot security

749
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
azure defender for iot

750
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,039
and the dragos platform and a lot of

751
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,720
these use anomalous traffic detection

752
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
using machine learning so there's some

753
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
creative ways we can we can go about

754
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,679
moving away from purdue or at least

755
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,840
segmentation for iot devices

756
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,799
so what's the conclusion of this is the

757
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,440
purdue

758
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,279
still relevant so increasingly cyber

759
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,200
attacks are having more physical effects

760
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,840
and becoming more dangerous experts are

761
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,520
warning that it's a matter of when

762
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,200
rather than if a cyber attack kills

763
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,880
someone

764
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,559
so in the last year german hospital was

765
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,559
hit with a ransomware attack

766
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,679
which was kind of the first um indirect

767
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,679
cyber attack or death from a cyber

768
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,960
attack

769
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,039
as the a e patient had to be diverted to

770
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,600
another hospital and died on route

771
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,880
this is indirect of course but as we see

772
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
more convergence between ot and i.t

773
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
expect to see more attacks and possibly

774
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,279
direct deaths as a result of incidents

775
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,360
in the near future

776
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,640
in the case of the old smart water

777
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,799
treatment facility if the attack was

778
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,240
more sophisticated

779
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,600
then it could have been catastrophic

780
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,960
but as we've seen from the attacks it's

781
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,679
not so much the architecture that can be

782
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,480
at fault

783
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,279
a lot of the time it's the

784
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,000
misconfiguration by humans

785
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,440
or having security of that as an

786
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,120
afterthought

787
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,000
which has long been a common issue that

788
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,039
being said

789
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,640
although the architecture is not also at

790
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,799
fault most of the time

791
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,799
having an up-to-date architecture will

792
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,520
allow administrators and designers

793
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
to follow and help to ensure the

794
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,840
system's secure from the outset

795
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,440
purdue is definitely still relevant

796
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,880
considering that most industries will

797
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,240
take some time to move beyond their

798
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,120
current setups

799
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,559
and integrate industrial internet of

800
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,039
things but at the same time

801
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,799
we know that purdue model isn't entirely

802
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,399
applicable for these modern systems

803
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,159
which don't have direct segmentation so

804
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,600
architectures such as the

805
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,919
european union agency for cybersecurity

806
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,240
model should at least be considered

807
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,840
even if businesses do not have iot

808
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,399
technology in their plans for the future

809
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,960
looking at these new architectures um

810
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,399
will enable the businesses to stay

811
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,279
protected

812
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,200
and also prepare for industry 4.0

813
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,799
and that's the end of the talk thank you

814
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,960
very much for listening um and thank you

815
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,919
for inviting me here

816
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,919
it's been a pleasure it's been a

817
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,120
pleasure having you

818
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,960
um so i've had a question for you um

819
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,919
specifically when you deal with um okay

820
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:50,880
these models

821
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,279
and you have recommendations from the

822
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,120
anasa

823
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,640
so at least in the world of iot

824
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,200
specifically uh so they have this uh

825
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,120
baseline set of recommendations

826
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,320
uh for iot and literally no one uh

827
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,520
applies almost half of them uh

828
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,440
so is this something you fear

829
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,360
is going to have a similar effect uh

830
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,039
with the revised purdue model

831
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,320
yeah i think so um it's one of these

832
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,000
things you can't you can't force people

833
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,880
to

834
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,520
to comply with these standards you can

835
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,880
if people are going to miss configure

836
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,000
systems

837
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,120
then they will and i think a lot of the

838
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,039
issue with misconfiguration

839
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,679
also comes from a lack of funding so

840
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,200
when they were talking about the old

841
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,399
the old smart water plan in the court

842
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:42,799
case

843
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,039
it was noted that there was a lack of

844
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,960
funding for cyber security

845
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,080
which was one of the issues so

846
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,440
if people aren't going to deal with them

847
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,520
then how can we how can we stop the

848
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,440
attacks well

849
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,880
if we have some of the tools which i

850
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,799
mentioned like the palo alto networks

851
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,440
offering and azure defender these can

852
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,240
provide

853
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,520
recommendations to businesses

854
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,679
if they have them installed without them

855
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,080
having to go and get external analysts

856
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,039
to come in so at a very low level they

857
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,520
can say

858
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,000
to you you have these devices which have

859
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,760
these vulnerabilities

860
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,080
um and trying to make things more

861
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,440
intelligent

862
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,399
well and make things easier for security

863
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,240
owners or owners of the systems who are

864
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,919
in charge of the security

865
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,720
will definitely help to to do things so

866
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,279
having

867
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,200
these using these new tools i think is

868
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,039
the main thing and trying to make use of

869
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,679
the technology

870
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,919
alrighty awesome and since iot devices

871
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,760
require certain levels of speed

872
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,120
how much does that compromise the

873
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,960
security of these systems how can these

874
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,720
systems use encryption as well as

875
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,240
be efficient enough for optimal use

876
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,840
yeah that is one of the issues like if

877
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,600
you have encrypted traffic decrypting it

878
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,480
and encrypting it

879
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,840
can provide some overheads um

880
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,519
it's not a simple answer uh in terms of

881
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,200
what we can actually do

882
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
to make things smart but it doesn't have

883
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,000
to be you know speed versus security

884
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,919
i think businesses can compromise

885
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,440
somewhere in the middle

886
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,480
um particularly and ensuring that

887
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,760
devices

888
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,080
have the robust vulnerability

889
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,519
vulnerability detection

890
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,530
on all of their devices um

891
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,880
[Music]

892
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,360
it's a bit of a it's a good question and

893
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,880
it's not one that has an easy answer i'm

894
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,480
afraid but

895
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,840
i'm sure the businesses would like to

896
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,519
find some sort of compromise

897
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,480
when they're doing their planning

898
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,279
and do you think a hybrid approach is

899
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,039
the best what's your personal opinion on

900
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,039
the purdue model

901
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,840
so personally i think it is a bit

902
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,799
outdated

903
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,000
and because this is new technology

904
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,039
we haven't really seen um

905
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,960
most of the attacks we've seen anyway

906
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,640
for ot networks

907
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,000
have come from traditional devices um

908
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,320
so we haven't seen a lot of high profile

909
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,200
at least

910
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,919
security incidents for iot devices and

911
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,080
industrial control systems

912
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,960
um so it remains to be seen whether or

913
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,440
not

914
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,320
the purdue model is beneficial but we're

915
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,279
not going to know

916
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,279
unless we try these new architectures

917
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,720
and having said that there are other

918
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,080
architectures for

919
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,360
for iot devices and industry but they

920
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,640
don't really talk about

921
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,480
um industrial controls like the

922
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,320
traditional systems

923
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,600
so they're perhaps not as applicable for

924
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,200
for these large enterprises which are

925
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,679
just looking to transform their business

926
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,200
and maybe for smaller enterprises

927
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,039
they're more applicable for people that

928
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,240
are designing a whole plan

929
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,840
afresh so it's kind of a trade-off

930
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,679
and we have to see in the years to come

931
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,000
how these architectures cope and if we

932
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,360
need to refine them

933
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,840
thank you so much thank you been great

934
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,600
yeah it definitely is and you have uh

935
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,440
some quite quite a few positive comments

936
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,640
and good discussion going on in the

937
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,159
youtube comments so thank you so much

938
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,679
for being here today and that was

939
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,360
fantastic and i i really enjoyed your

940
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,799
presentation thank you

941
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,399
thank you it was great thanks for the

942
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,840
opportunity guys

943
