1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,040
on to you uh drew

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,480
thank you so much uh i'm drew jones

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,639
and i'm going to be talking about

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,679
preparing for

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,720
the oscp without any pen testing

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,198
experience

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,600
so a little background about me

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,800
i am a system administrator working

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,519
mostly

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,479
with windows active directory i also am

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,320
a freelance penetration tester

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,800
having done penetration tests for

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,719
companies looking to partner with

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,320
geo tab and telus i have the oscp

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,360
and crtp certifications and i'm working

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,640
on finishing up the oswe

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,399
so i passed the oscp in august of 2020

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,760
on my first attempt i did it with no

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,800
previous cyber security or it experience

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
at the time i was working as a

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,799
it hardware specialist so not really

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
pertaining to penetration testing or

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,240
networking at all

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,799
and i did it without i don't have a

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,159
university education

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,000
and this was my first certificate so i

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,600
am 100 self-taught

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,119
in terms of cyber security and

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,680
penetration testing

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
so a quick overview of what i will be

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,680
talking about today

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,080
is i'm going to be covering the mindset

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,840
and habits needed

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,240
for taking the oscp and preparing for

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,680
the ostp

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,280
oscp as well as i will be providing some

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
practice resources

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,759
to help you along your way i'm also

39
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,360
going to be covering some penetration

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,520
testing tips and tricks

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,079
as they pertain to the osep so that way

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,600
you have a better understanding

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,880
of what difficulties you may encounter

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,600
and i'm not going to be talking about a

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,000
entire

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,759
pen testing tutorial just because i

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
simply don't have time

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,479
to do so so if you're unfamiliar the

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,360
oscp

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
is a penetration testing certificate

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,000
offered by offensive security

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and it really tests the fundamentals of

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
penetration testing

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,319
such as enumeration exploitation

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,599
privilege escalation and buffer overflow

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,000
when you sign up for the oscp you're

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,360
given a large

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,000
pdf and a bunch of videos as well as

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
access to their private pwk lab

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,040
environment and this is considered an

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
industry standard penetration testing

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
certificate

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,080
so the ocp exam is a 24 hour exam

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
for the exploit and then you are given

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
an additional 24 hours to submit the

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,640
report

67
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,599
after your lab acts or after your exam

68
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,120
access has been cut

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,959
there are total of five targets and

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,319
you're going to need

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,680
70 points to pass there's an

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,720
optional lab write-up for five points so

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,360
there's a total of 105 points available

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,959
and you're not allowed to use any

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,560
automated exploit tools

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,400
such as sql map burp sweep pro or nessus

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,879
and however you are allowed to use one

78
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,840
metasploit module

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,800
so i'm going to talk about what you're

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
going to need to do before signing up

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,879
for the pwk labs

82
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
so what are you going to need to know

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,120
well you're going to need to know a lot

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
for example the tools you're going to

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
need to know is nmap go buster linum

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,319
noquitos search please s b clan john

87
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,760
hash catcher lock their

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,879
p link w fuzz and a lot more

89
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,640
and that's just the tools what about the

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,480
exploits well you're going to

91
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,480
need to know lfi and rfi sql injections

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,760
and a lot more stop all right that is

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,159
not

94
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
a good way of learning the information

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,000
you can't just make a list of

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
everything you need to know and study

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
each piece by piece

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
you're going to have to work on the

99
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,519
methodology of penetration testing

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,200
so that way you understand how to

101
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
actually perform a penetration test

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
rather than just knowing oh well i run

103
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,560
go buster to

104
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,319
brute force directories you will need to

105
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,760
know that but you really are going to

106
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,959
have to work on the methodology

107
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
so when it comes to working on the

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,680
methodology and studying for the oscp

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
i think it's important to think about

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the offensive security slogan

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,720
try harder what does try harder mean it

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,560
means going the extra mile

113
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,320
you're going to be mentally challenged

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
throughout the oscp

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,440
so you're going to have to work past

116
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,919
when you're mentally blocked and go the

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
extra step

118
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,840
in terms of trying harder you're going

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,520
to have to learn to google

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,120
everything in my little gif here

121
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
this might be something you would ask

122
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
someone on discord or twitter

123
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,080
how do i enumerate http well google has

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,800
that answer

125
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,280
and they actually have answers for just

126
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,880
about everything you're going to need to

127
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,520
know

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,400
for the oscp and chances are it can

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,199
provide a more

130
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,960
in-depth answer than someone is willing

131
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,840
to write out for you

132
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,919
so you're going to have to learn a lot

133
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,360
so you will want to take

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,680
really good notes i would recommend

135
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
using a note-taking tool

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,479
such as obsidian or github or gitlab

137
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,520
markdown

138
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,919
and i would recommend using a markdown

139
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,680
editor because you're going to want to

140
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
include photos and code snippets

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,600
of any tools you learn

142
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,280
or any boxes you root and

143
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,720
you're going to come across really

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
useful um websites

145
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,840
and links and so instead of just copying

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,560
and pasting

147
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
all that information just make a

148
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,000
bookmark of it make a little note being

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,960
like

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,280
here's a really good tutorial for hydra

151
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,160
and then the link

152
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,440
instead of copying down all the

153
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,280
information it'll help keep your notes

154
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
more organized

155
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,199
and i would recommend doing a write-up

156
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,199
of every machine that you manage to root

157
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,880
this will help you not only retain the

158
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,639
information but will be a really good

159
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,400
reference

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,319
i would really recommend doing this for

161
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,520
the pwk

162
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,960
uh machines because once you finish the

163
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,160
pwk

164
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
you're not going to have access to the

165
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,080
labs anymore and there's also no public

166
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,560
write-ups so if you forget how you did

167
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,520
one of the machines

168
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
you're never going to be able to know

169
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,800
again unless you go back and redo it

170
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
and then i would recommend having a

171
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,919
master list of all the machines you've

172
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,240
done

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
for a quick reference so this is my

174
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,000
example

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,120
of a master list for my notes this

176
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,840
is for hack the box and these were my

177
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
notes when i was preparing for the oscp

178
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,759
before i signed up for the pwk

179
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,160
labs so on the left side i have the name

180
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,960
of the box

181
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,280
and then i have the operating system and

182
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,199
then i have if i rooted or if i haven't

183
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,639
done the box yet

184
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,479
and then the part i blocked out because

185
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,319
i didn't want to spoil any of the

186
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:46,880
machines

187
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
is a one line explaining the exploit and

188
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,080
the prives

189
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,120
process for example if i rooted a

190
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,440
machine with php deserialization and

191
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
kernel exploit

192
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,720
i would just put that information there

193
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,080
and if i ever came across

194
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,960
that again i know i could just reference

195
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,400
my write-up for that machine

196
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,599
so the offensive slogan

197
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,080
is try harder but i think it's also to

198
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,199
remember to try

199
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,919
smarter especially when you're new to

200
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,759
penetration testing you're not going to

201
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,479
know a lot

202
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,360
and instead of wasting your time on

203
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
basic concepts for a week like trying to

204
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
figure out how to even run an

205
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,840
nmap scan know your limits and know when

206
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,880
to look a

207
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
look up a write up for a machine or a

208
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
tool because you can no longer

209
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,479
proceed unless you learn something new

210
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,360
so this will trying smarter pertains to

211
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,199
reading write-ups before completing

212
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,360
some people say that you shouldn't ever

213
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,319
do this but

214
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,080
i personally believe there's nothing

215
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
wrong with it

216
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
especially if you're new to penetration

217
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,039
testing because it will be a great

218
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,520
way to learn the methodology and new

219
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
tools

220
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,240
i would just i would recommend making

221
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,400
sure that you make notes on

222
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,520
what is done how they do it if it's

223
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,759
a machine walk through your wall you're

224
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,360
uh reading or watching

225
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,919
make sure you take notes on each step

226
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,199
they do if it's a tool

227
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,759
make sure you make notes on how they use

228
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,400
the tool and what they use the tool for

229
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
and i'd also recommend following along

230
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,919
with whatever guide

231
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
you are doing do the machine with them

232
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,919
use the tool with them

233
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,520
that will help you retain it and help

234
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,960
you actually understand

235
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,160
what they're doing and while this is

236
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,000
helpful you're not going to want to do

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
this forever because you will be

238
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
missing out on the actual learning

239
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,279
process of how

240
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,279
of how to teaching yourself how to learn

241
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,240
so if you've read or watched a few

242
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,839
guides and you feel ready to

243
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,040
try practicing out on a target or a

244
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
machine on your own

245
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
this is a strategy i'd recommend trying

246
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,720
that i found really useful for me

247
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,399
is start by trying until you're

248
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,080
completely stuck

249
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
say for example you're on the

250
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
enumeration phase

251
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,160
and you are trying to enumerate a web

252
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,880
port

253
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,440
so you've googled everything you can

254
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,920
related to that web port and you've used

255
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,440
all the tools like nmap

256
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,959
go buster and quito whatever and you're

257
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,440
completely stumped and you've spent

258
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,959
countless hours on it

259
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,440
i recommend looking for a hint after

260
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,080
that

261
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
a lot of a lot of places have forums or

262
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
discord you could ask

263
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
for a hint and people would be happy to

264
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,279
provide it so that way

265
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,640
you can get a little nudge

266
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,560
forward instead of looking at the actual

267
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
solution if

268
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,800
after you've gotten a hint or multiple

269
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,360
head

270
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
hints and you're still stuck look up the

271
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,519
solution for only that part

272
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,680
if you're stuck on the enumeration phase

273
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
only look up the solution for the

274
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,399
enumeration

275
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,560
and don't look up the solution for the

276
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
privilege escalation as well

277
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,880
because that's just the waste and then

278
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
repeat the entire process

279
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
look up the solution for numeration then

280
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,200
go ahead and try the exploitation until

281
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,880
you're completely stuck then look at the

282
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,680
hint

283
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
and do this over and over until you've

284
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,240
completed the machine

285
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
and then after you've completed the

286
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
machine i'd recommend reading someone

287
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,760
else's write-up

288
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,519
you can learn a lot from reading someone

289
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,120
else's write-up even if you've done the

290
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,640
entire machine

291
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
because someone might explain something

292
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,399
that you didn't completely understand

293
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,000
or they might have used a completely

294
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
different methodology

295
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,200
and it's important to take note of that

296
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
so we've all heard the uh

297
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
phrase practice makes perfect and i

298
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,160
think the oocp

299
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,120
is a perfect example of practice makes

300
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,000
perfect

301
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,399
this is a chart released by offensive

302
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,360
security

303
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,399
on the x-axis you can see the number of

304
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,279
pwk

305
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,200
lab machines compromised and on the

306
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,880
y-axis you can see the

307
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,160
oscp pass rate as you can tell there's a

308
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
clear correlation between the higher

309
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,839
number of machines compromised and the

310
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,040
higher pass rate

311
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
meaning if you practice more you're

312
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
going to have a better shot

313
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,160
at passing so

314
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,760
if you're going to practice you're going

315
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,399
to have to use linux

316
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,800
since majority of the tools you need

317
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,760
will be on a linux machine

318
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
i would recommend using kali linux or

319
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
paired os as they have a lot of the

320
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,279
tools already installed

321
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,360
if you're completely new you could try

322
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
out kali linux because it is developed

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,680
by

324
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,399
offensive security so they have a good

325
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,279
so they will

326
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,200
provide you with good arsenal of tools

327
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,600
needed

328
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,079
and in so to practice while trying you

329
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,079
could use the pwk labs

330
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,800
but the la pwk labs are limited i think

331
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,519
they're around

332
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,000
80 total machines and they're not super

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,519
easy to jump into

334
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,800
as well as they can be a little

335
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
expensive starting at a thousand dollars

336
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,880
for 30 days

337
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
so these are four of the most popular

338
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,880
alternatives to use

339
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,160
and i want to take a second and look at

340
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,120
tj knowles and the mayor's path to oscp

341
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,440
guide

342
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,760
they have tj knoll if you're unaware is

343
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,120
the community manager

344
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,760
at offensive security and they comprise

345
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,399
this list

346
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
of machines on the four platforms i will

347
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,399
talk about

348
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
that are similar to the oscp

349
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,519
and i believe there's over 80 machines

350
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,720
total here

351
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
and they're all very closely related to

352
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,040
the ocp and really help you understand

353
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,800
the process and methodology needed

354
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,120
so the first one i would like to discuss

355
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,440
is

356
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,920
tryhackme which is a really amazing

357
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,560
platform

358
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
for beginners um the reason why it's

359
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,399
really good for beginners is because

360
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,399
they have an introduction to tools and

361
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,200
techniques

362
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,720
that are used in the hacking process

363
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
as well as providing step-by-step

364
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,760
tutorials

365
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
on how to exploit this i they have

366
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,680
tutorials on

367
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,959
lfi and rfi on sql injection and a

368
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,480
bunch more so if you're struggling with

369
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,320
the concept i'd recommend checking them

370
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,279
out

371
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,200
and in addition to that they do actually

372
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
have full machines where

373
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,160
you have to enumerate you have to

374
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,320
perform your exploit and you have to

375
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,040
perform privilege escalation

376
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,200
so they're definitely a fantastic

377
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,880
resource when preparing for the oscp

378
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,839
cybersec labs is a honestly i believe

379
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,120
they're really good resource

380
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,959
even though they're no longer releasing

381
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,440
machines but the machines they do have

382
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,800
available

383
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,160
are really geared towards beginners

384
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,920
um they're really geared towards

385
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,360
beginners simply because

386
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,760
they don't require heavy enumeration and

387
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
the exploits are very simple

388
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
if you're struggling with hack the box

389
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
or even some try hacking

390
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
machines i'd recommend checking out

391
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,560
cybersec labs just because they're

392
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,240
from what i found the most beginner

393
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,839
oriented types of

394
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,920
machines hack the box is my personal

395
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,560
favorite

396
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
however they are knocked towards

397
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
beginners and they do require a little

398
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,240
more experience

399
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,160
as they are a little more complicated in

400
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
the entire

401
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,839
penetration testing process however

402
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,560
these machines are super oscp like

403
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,639
and i would definitely recommend

404
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,839
tackling them

405
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,160
if not if you're unable to do them first

406
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,079
i recommend going to them later

407
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,320
and one of the great resources of hack

408
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,279
the box

409
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,360
is a youtuber named ipsec and he does

410
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,320
fantastic walkthroughs of every single

411
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,000
hack-the-box machine

412
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,560
and i can't stress enough how useful his

413
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,440
walkthroughs are

414
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,480
and just how good at explaining

415
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,880
the entire process he is the last one

416
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
is virtual hacking labs and they

417
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,000
actually offer an

418
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,320
entire course when you sign up for them

419
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,480
so they offer step-by-step walk-throughs

420
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
which can be very helpful to beginners

421
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,120
and they do

422
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,959
have their own lab access as well

423
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,959
so if you have done those four

424
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,440
or three or two or you feel ready and

425
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,279
you're ready to sign for the pwk labs

426
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,560
this is my advice on

427
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,199
how to actually tackle the entire lab

428
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,240
process

429
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,120
so i know you'll want to jump and do the

430
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,639
machines they have first but i would

431
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,760
recommend doing

432
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,120
the pdf and exercises uh it will really

433
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,399
teach you

434
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,800
a lot and an in-depth for some things it

435
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,399
won't teach you everything so you can't

436
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,120
solely

437
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,759
rely on the pdf and videos but it does

438
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,199
really teach you a lot and it

439
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,759
teaches you how to think about certain

440
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,639
exploits and enumeration

441
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,399
i'd recommend doing the lab write-up

442
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
since it is a free five points

443
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,120
it will take you a while it took me

444
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,560
about seven days of

445
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,120
really hard work to get it completed but

446
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,800
it's a free five points

447
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,720
and you don't want to end up with 65

448
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,839
points and

449
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,680
not do the lab write up and you'll be

450
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,120
kicking yourself

451
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,160
for not doing the lab write-up really uh

452
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
as i said earlier i recommend doing a

453
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,240
write-up for every machine that you

454
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
root that way you have a good reference

455
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,800
for them and you can help

456
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
it will help immensely with your

457
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,800
note-taking process

458
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
there are a few active directory

459
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,399
machines for the pwk labs

460
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,320
and you shouldn't be afraid of them i

461
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,000
think you should tackle them

462
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,720
head-on if you're not good with windows

463
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
do them

464
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,959
if you're good with windows they should

465
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,000
be easy so i definitely would recommend

466
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,240
looking at the active directory machines

467
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,320
and as i've already discussed

468
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,240
use the forms for the hints they're a

469
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
good thing but don't use them

470
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,320
don't only rely on the forms for every

471
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,399
machine you use

472
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,440
um this is another this is the pwk labs

473
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,560
provided by

474
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,959
offensive security i won't provide any

475
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,959
spoilers but it's really

476
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,120
really well laid out i learned a ton and

477
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,680
i bet you will too

478
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,199
okay so now i'm going to talk about some

479
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,600
pen testing tips and tricks that i found

480
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,799
one

481
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,919
when taking the oscdp these tips and

482
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,359
tricks are more pertaining

483
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,720
for thinking about the oscp rather than

484
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,880
just general tips and tricks

485
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,240
so the four topics for the for

486
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,199
pen testing for the oscp is enumeration

487
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,880
initial exploitation

488
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,959
privilege escalation for both windows

489
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,640
and linux and buffer overflow

490
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
enumeration is by far the most important

491
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
step of this entire process

492
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,280
you should always be having enumeration

493
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,880
running in the background

494
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,200
whether you're running more nmap scans

495
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,400
or you're running

496
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,520
num for linux for smb or

497
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,840
go buster on every single directory you

498
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,919
found it's important to explore

499
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,600
every inch of the machine

500
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
and you should be using all the tools

501
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,799
that you're allowed to

502
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,880
just because you think one tool won't

503
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,799
give you more information than the other

504
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,039
if you're stuck run both maybe it will

505
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,640
give you more information

506
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
and you're going to want to be aware of

507
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,000
rabbit holes

508
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,720
if you're unfamiliar a rabbit hole is

509
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,840
going down a path

510
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,400
that you think is exploitable but it is

511
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,520
not

512
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,400
and this really wastes a lot of time and

513
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,360
brain power

514
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,720
especially when you're in a 24 hour

515
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,039
time restraint like you are when you're

516
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,720
taking the oscp

517
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,000
so you should really know how to

518
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
identify a rabbit hole because you

519
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,039
will see them on the exam

520
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,600
so this is a quick example from a recent

521
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,559
retired

522
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,280
machine on hack the box where the

523
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,080
enumeration

524
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,559
wasn't as simple as you may think you

525
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,360
had to

526
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,080
run a go buster scan on an already found

527
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,200
directory

528
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,799
and that will lead you to another

529
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,880
directory where the exploit actually is

530
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
a lot of people don't run recursive go

531
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,240
buster scans

532
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
and this is what i mean when you should

533
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
always explore every inch of the machine

534
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,679
because you never know where the exploit

535
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,360
will actually be

536
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,120
and if you're curious you can read the

537
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,559
full write-up on my website

538
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,400
so after you finish the enumeration

539
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,880
process you're going to need to

540
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
perform the initial exploit and

541
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,160
i really can't stress how important

542
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,200
enumeration

543
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
is if you've already enumerated well you

544
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,600
should know the exact

545
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,200
exploit process you're going to have to

546
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
take so you're going to want to look for

547
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,720
the version of

548
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,640
services that are running whether it's

549
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
looking through the source code

550
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
using netcat or using other tools like

551
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,200
nmap

552
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,960
you're going to want to find the service

553
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
version

554
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
running and then you're going to want to

555
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,559
see if it's vulnerable

556
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,919
looking for it on exploit db github

557
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,480
using searchplate or blogs there's a lot

558
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,200
of ways

559
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,960
you can look it up and you should just

560
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,200
be googling the service

561
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
the version and then see if it's

562
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,520
vulnerable

563
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,440
sometimes the exploit won't always be

564
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,960
right in front of you and you will have

565
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,240
to string information

566
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,760
together for example if you find

567
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,000
if you find say credentials on

568
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,440
the http port and you test them and they

569
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
don't log you into the website there

570
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
test them out on ssh test them out on

571
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
smd string together

572
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,000
multiple exploits if needed even to

573
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,039
perform

574
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,679
the initial exploitation and land a

575
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,840
reverse shell

576
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,240
so you're going to need to know the most

577
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
common web exploits

578
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,080
such as sql injections directory

579
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
traversals lfi rfis

580
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,520
you're going to have to know how each of

581
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,360
these exploits work and

582
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,200
how they will lead you to remote code

583
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,480
execution

584
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,000
i'd also highly recommend getting

585
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
familiar with reverse shells

586
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,360
and i'd recommend getting familiar with

587
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
a lot of different ones such as pentas

588
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,280
monkey or payload all the things

589
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,159
nishing or msf venom these are all great

590
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,520
and you should know how to

591
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,120
you should know each one of these very

592
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,360
well

593
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,200
and then to help you before you the oscp

594
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,679
and to help you really understand how

595
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,640
the exploit works i'd recommend

596
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,559
testing different scripts if you find a

597
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,360
script that works try changing it around

598
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,960
look at how the payload they use and

599
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,280
maybe try and change it if they're using

600
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,559
a bash payload change it to like a php

601
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,080
or something and see if you can get that

602
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,720
to work

603
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
figure out why it will work or why it

604
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,960
won't

605
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,039
so after you've performed your initial

606
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,880
exploit you're going to have to

607
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
perform privilege escalation for

608
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,720
majority of the machines

609
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,240
if you're unfamiliar privilege

610
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,840
escalation is elevating

611
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,360
from an unprivileged user to a

612
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,280
privileged user such as

613
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,440
the root or administrator or nt

614
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,679
authority user

615
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,520
so the enumeration process will really

616
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,720
be starting all over

617
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,480
you may be able to use a little

618
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,799
information from your initial scans but

619
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,480
really it's going to start all over

620
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,400
and you're going to need to rerun

621
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,320
scripts test for known weaknesses

622
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,840
checking for kernel exploits really your

623
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,640
numeration

624
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,880
is going to start completely over and

625
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,799
you're going to have to really enumerate

626
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,679
the target

627
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,760
like you've never seen it before because

628
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,520
most of your previous information

629
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,039
is irrelevant at this point

630
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,360
scripts are super important when it

631
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,159
comes to privilege

632
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,880
escalation for the oscp so you're going

633
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,240
to want to know

634
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,400
multiple scripts for both linux and

635
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,240
windows and know how to read their

636
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,039
output

637
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,559
and if you know how to read their output

638
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,480
and you see something that looks weird

639
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,679
just google it see a weird su id

640
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,520
google that s you id and see if there's

641
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,919
a reason it's set like that and if you

642
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,320
can exploit it or if there's a weird

643
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,039
service running or if there's a cron job

644
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
google it and see what you can do with

645
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,600
it

646
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,720
and a lot of people are nervous of

647
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,480
windows privilege escalation

648
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,039
especially when they first start off and

649
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,679
honestly

650
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,039
it's a lot easier than you think i know

651
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
you will be using linux so you're more

652
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,320
familiar with linux but windows is

653
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,520
actually a simpler

654
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,120
simpler process than linux and if you

655
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,000
just practice

656
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,200
you'll have it down very well

657
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,280
so you're going to see buffer overflow

658
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,120
on the oscp and you know you'll see

659
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,400
buffer overflow

660
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,799
the other machines could be anything

661
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,080
they could be windows they could be

662
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
linux they could be web exports they

663
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,360
could really be

664
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
anything but you know there will be

665
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,400
buffer overflow

666
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,080
and this should be free points to be

667
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
completely honest

668
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,919
i would highly recommend knowing how to

669
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,720
use immunity debugger well

670
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,120
as you as a lot of tutorials use

671
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,039
immunity debugger for the buffer

672
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,039
overflow process

673
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,799
and this process should be really

674
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,960
ingrained in your head

675
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
um it's really the same steps every time

676
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,760
for me i personally wrote it out in

677
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,440
eight steps but i know other people who

678
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,200
did six to ten

679
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,840
and it really should take you only 30 to

680
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,520
45 minutes to complete

681
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
a buffer overflow in terms of how the

682
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,880
oscp

683
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,520
takes it and there are a ton of great

684
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,400
guides out there

685
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
each one will teach you in different

686
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,640
ways so i'd recommend checking them out

687
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,360
if you

688
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,600
are struggling or you just straight up

689
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,120
don't understand buffer overflow

690
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,279
so i know this was a lot and it can be

691
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,799
daunting especially if you think you're

692
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,799
going to be tackling it on your own but

693
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,799
there's actually a fantastic community

694
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,240
behind all

695
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,000
there's actually a fantastic community

696
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,320
for people taking the oscp

697
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,399
and people who are done with the oscp

698
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,159
there's a lot of uh there's a lot of

699
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,520
discords out there

700
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,919
that discuss the oscp there's an

701
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,640
official one

702
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,520
from offensive security however it's not

703
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,279
super active so i'd actually recommend

704
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,440
checking out the infosec discord

705
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,240
they have discussions about every single

706
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,760
offensive security certificate

707
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,360
especially the oscp

708
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,760
and there's always people discussing

709
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
every day about the exercises about

710
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,080
machines getting hints

711
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,679
and all of that so i would really

712
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,120
recommend checking that out

713
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,960
if you're not signed up for the pwk yet

714
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,559
you can also check out like hack the box

715
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,960
and try hack me

716
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
check out their discords because they

717
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,400
have discussions there about all the

718
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,159
machines and people would always be

719
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:06,960
willing to provide

720
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
hints or help you with a solution if

721
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
you're struggling

722
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,120
and there's a bunch of small communities

723
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,880
that you'll discover out there who

724
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
are probably within your skill set and

725
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,720
would love to run through machines with

726
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,760
you

727
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
when you sign up for the pwk you get

728
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,520
access to their forums

729
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,279
i would highly recommend checking them

730
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,440
out just because they're super useful

731
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
and people are always discussing there

732
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
as well

733
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,679
a lot of people on twitter are also

734
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:34,640
taking the oscp

735
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,400
so you can look around twitter talk to

736
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,159
people on there and i'm sure you can

737
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,559
make a lot of great contacts with that

738
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,080
and you can always reach out to me for

739
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,520
if you have any questions pertaining to

740
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,760
the ocp i'd be happy to answer them for

741
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,559
you

742
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,919
so if you finish the pwk labs and you

743
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,279
feel ready

744
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,039
these are my exam tips for when you're

745
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,720
actually in the oscp

746
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,880
and like always you're going to want to

747
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,159
keep really good notes

748
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,279
while you're in the exam i'd recommend

749
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,480
using cherry tree or

750
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,640
obsidian as these are really good note

751
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,480
taking tools and honestly by the time

752
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,360
you finish the

753
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,720
oscp exam your write-up should be pretty

754
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,799
much done because you've taken such good

755
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,880
notes of each process after that map

756
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,320
scan screencap

757
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,640
and map scan put it there you run go

758
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,000
buster put go busted

759
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,679
there you find the initial exploit put

760
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,039
the initial exploit there

761
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,720
really all you should need to do is just

762
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,159
write up a little bit

763
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
of what you did each time and you should

764
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,320
be done

765
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,720
you're going to want to enumerate very

766
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,760
very

767
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,640
well for the oscp and you're going to

768
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,679
want to make sure

769
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,120
if you're stuck just enumerate more

770
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,480
i would recommend starting with buffer

771
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,799
overflow because it's a free

772
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,440
3-ish 25 points it should be easy enough

773
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,880
if you do the lab write-up and you're

774
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,480
very good at buffer overflow you could

775
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,320
easily have 30 points within the first

776
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,000
30 minutes of the oscp

777
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,520
if you come across a machine that you

778
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,159
believe

779
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,360
is that you believe the metasploit

780
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,200
module can exploit i'd recommend just

781
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,080
using it

782
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,360
instead of spending several hours trying

783
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,360
to do it manually and failing

784
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,720
if you have a mess plate module

785
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,880
available just use it

786
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,559
especially if you're confident in doing

787
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,720
so that way you waste less time on the

788
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,760
exam

789
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,200
and obviously you're going to want to

790
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
take breaks and not over caffeinate

791
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,080
it is a 24 hour exam if you over

792
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
caffeinate you'll burn out at a certain

793
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,399
point

794
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,600
so definitely make sure you know your

795
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,440
caffeine limits

796
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,080
and also make sure you back up your

797
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,640
machine

798
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,840
or any note you take in case your vm

799
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,640
breaks you don't want to be finishing up

800
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,440
your exam

801
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,559
and your vm to break and then you will

802
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,279
have

803
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,720
nothing left and have to redo the exam

804
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,000
and if you have any questions feel free

805
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,159
to reach out to me i'm constantly

806
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,080
checking my twitter but i will also

807
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,039
check my email

808
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,360
thank you

809
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,120
awesome um we've had a few questions

810
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,919
come in

811
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,320
uh quite a few actually uh the oscp is

812
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,480
apparently an interesting subject uh

813
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,279
uh in infosec who would have thought no

814
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:11,840
um

815
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,559
this is sarcasm of course um on to the

816
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,200
questions

817
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,240
um if i can find them

818
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,640
there we go i have them okay so

819
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,760
for someone who is self-taught uh

820
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,840
at what level would you rate the uscpa

821
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,159
exam

822
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,360
i'm sorry i'm not sure i quite

823
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,320
understand what level like of difficulty

824
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,000
yeah is it something that is extremely

825
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,840
hard is it something that is

826
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,720
medium but is attainable if you put in

827
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,760
the work

828
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,720
definitely obtainable um like i said i

829
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,919
didn't have any experience

830
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,399
and i passed on my first time you're

831
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,679
just going to have to put in all the

832
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,320
work i

833
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,720
i did all hack the box try hack me

834
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,559
cybersec in about

835
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,159
50 pwk labs um

836
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,080
so you're just going to have to practice

837
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,960
practice practice

838
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,039
all righty awesome that actually covers

839
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,799
another question as well

840
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,279
um so do you have any specific boxes on

841
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,679
hack the box that you'd recommend

842
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,720
yeah um there's that huge list um

843
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,559
from tj knoll you can find it it's

844
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,399
everywhere you could just google tj no

845
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,039
oscp list for hack the box

846
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,399
i'm sorry it's really far back um

847
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,640
and it's honestly really well done i did

848
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,720
all try hack me cybersec lab and hack

849
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,880
the box and i can tell you each one

850
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,640
is very similar to what you'll see for

851
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,480
pwk labs or oscp

852
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,600
awesome okay and what do you think was

853
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,720
harder the write-up

854
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,399
or in the boxes the boxes for sure

855
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,279
like i said um i did a write-up for

856
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,960
every single one of the machines i

857
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,559
rooted so i had like

858
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,039
i don't know almost probably over 100

859
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,240
write-ups so

860
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,799
i was just once i got the write-ups i

861
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,240
could just

862
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,080
bang it out super quick just because i

863
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
knew what i needed to screen cap

864
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,159
how to organize organize my notes

865
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,840
correctly especially in a short period

866
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,559
of time

867
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,320
so that's why another reason why i'd

868
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
recommend doing write-offs of every

869
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,399
machine

870
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,360
you root

871
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,960
okay um we

872
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,799
also right up it's a question about

873
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,919
pacing so you answered it quite well

874
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,960
uh you know uh it's turning yeah okay

875
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,039
don't over caffeinate um

876
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,000
so do you use a full 24 hours uh to do

877
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,679
the oscp exam would you like take a

878
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,480
break in the middle

879
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,000
multiple breaks uh how

880
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,120
how did you do it uh personally

881
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,960
yeah um i over caffeinated which is why

882
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,240
i added that bit

883
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,080
i did like four machines in

884
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,360
like six and a half hours and then

885
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,840
i was like sweet i got my passing points

886
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,600
i'm feeling pretty good i took like a 30

887
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,279
to 45 minute break

888
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,360
and then i went back to it and i noticed

889
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,880
my productivity level just

890
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,120
like crash because i drank all that

891
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,320
caffeine it was wearing off

892
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,000
so i tried to recaffeinate didn't work

893
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,840
try to have a nap couldn't even nap

894
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,120
because i was so

895
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,720
over caffeinated so

896
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,279
don't do what i did it if you don't get

897
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,000
lucky and you

898
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,519
can and you don't finish those machines

899
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,480
quickly you'll crash so

900
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,640
consider it like a work take a break

901
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,240
every hour and a half every two hours

902
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,600
you're gonna have to see what works best

903
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,840
for you

904
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,760

uh write-up tips and

909
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,840
um if you pass the ocp on your first try

910
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,960
but i believe you already covered though
