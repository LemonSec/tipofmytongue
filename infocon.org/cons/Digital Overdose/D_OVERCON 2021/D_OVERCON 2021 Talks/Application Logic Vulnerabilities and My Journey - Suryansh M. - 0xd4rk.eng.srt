2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,480
wow

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,520
hi so um my name is suryanch

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,600
and i'll be talking about application

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,920
logic vulnerability vulnerabilities and

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,560
my own journey into cyber security along

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,680
with how i got to

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,080
cves completely by accident back in

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,279
middle school

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,280
from apple so here's a basic

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,000
um who am i um i'm currently enrolled in

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,879
high school and i love to do ctfs

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,960
to be honest i think i do it like i

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,399
think every weekend

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,120
for almost a year along with bug bounty

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,559
hunting because i think it's a

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,480
really really rewarding hobby and career

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,719
i started off with ios development back

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,079
in eighth grade

20
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,359
which paved my way into ios

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,719
security um with those two cves and

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,280
i managed to publish two apps to the app

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,320
store

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,640
and a fun hobby of mine is just poetry

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,439
and playwriting

26
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,720
um if you want to see any of my pieces

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,200
or

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
any technical articles feel free to

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,119
check out my

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,479
medium which i'll link in the last slide

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,560
so here's a basic overview of what we're

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,000
going to cover today

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
we'll start off with what exactly are

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,320
application logic vulnerabilities

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,960
um what are the different types of logic

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,520
forms

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,079
along with how to exploit them and i'll

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,360
start by giving

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
different examples into different

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,640
instances where there were logic forms

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
and then we'll move on to methodologies

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,000
and i'll talk about

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,799
how the i'll talk about the general

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,520
conventional

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,399
methodology a lot of people have while

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,040
let's say

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,079
approaching um a pen test

48
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,560
or an htv box or you know a tcham box

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,159
and then i'll move on to my own

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,439
accidental cds and just give a more

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,920
practical insight into what i did step

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,200
by step with screenshots

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
so here is a general overview as to what

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,959
exactly are

55
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,000
application logic vulnerabilities so

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,319
to be basic they're just weaknesses and

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,280
app features

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,040
you can talk about it like a lack of

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,560
sanitization

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,599
for example when um a site blacklists

61
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,879
certain characters

62
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,720
or does not blacklist certain characters

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,000
in an

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,360
input form or a certain parameter which

65
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
allows an attacker to exploit a certain

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
vulnerability

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,879
or let's say broken authentication where

68
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,040
an attacker is able to just get the same

69
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,080
privileges as

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,599
the victim and the authentication is

71
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,160
considered

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,480
broken whenever these attackers are able

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:52,770
to

74
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,160
[Music]

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,640
compromise sensitive information for

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
example like session tokens

77
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
which allow for account takeover

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
and then access control is a pretty

79
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,280
basic

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,319
upfront logic form which

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,319
basically states that a user can out

82
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,400
can act outside of their own intended

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,599
permissions

84
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,159
which leads to unauthorized access of

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,280
extremely

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,000
sensitive data

87
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,120
insufficient uh workflow validation

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,200
basically is more of a developer site

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,159
law

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,519
where developers make flawed assumptions

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,920
about the sequence of events that a user

92
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,840
will go through in a workflow

93
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
which could lead to further

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
vulnerabilities like

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
um two-factor authentication bypass

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
and even privilege escalation which i'll

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,720
be talking about

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,000
in my um my sv my cves

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
i'll also talk about denial of service

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,159
with business logic

101
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,519
in the examples below

102
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,840
okay so here are some examples of logic

103
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,720
bones

104
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,599
we'll start off with um basic uh

105
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
parameter manipulation

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
where um you can see in the first

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,200
example where

108
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,879
let's say you're um checking out um your

109
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,080
order

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,399
on a site and the cost is 1

111
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,798
37 and you notice that

112
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,520
it's actually hard coded into the url

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,120
and if you edit it and change it to one

114
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,840
dollar it

115
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,479
immediately changes back to one dollar

116
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,880
obviously this isn't um

117
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,919
very common nowadays but it still is

118
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,040
reflected in

119
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,520
bones like for example html injection

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,880
we see the same type of flaw

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
with banking accounts or basically any

122
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,720
profile

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,919
which has and contains sensitive data

124
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,240
for example if your account id is 69420

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,199
and i change my and i change the url

126
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,080
parameter

127
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,280
to 69421 um

128
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,960
i'm going to be able to look at the um

129
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,560
the sensitive data of the user under

130
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,280
69421

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,160
and an attacker can actually um change

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
its vulnerability

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,680
and get an entire credential dump or

134
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,039
find out the entire admin credentials

135
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,880
by maybe changing the id to something

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,080
like zero or one

137
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,639
in order to gain administrative access

138
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,360
you can see

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
the um the same exact idea in cookie

140
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,199
manipulation

141
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,400
where um you can change the

142
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,520
cookie value of let's say a user from 28

143
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,960
to 29

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,039
save the cookie and reload to see it

145
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
take place

146
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,240
in this example here i'm using a firefox

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,320
extension although you could use

148
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,919
something like burp suite and intercept

149
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,520
the request and change the cookies from

150
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,120
there

151
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,800
so to go back to what i was talking

152
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,000
about in relation to denial of service

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,840
with business logic let's say you were

154
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,440
perhaps booking movie tickets

155
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,080
in let's say a time restriction or

156
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,639
perhaps

157
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,960
uh three minutes before a timeout

158
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,639
without any ticket limit

159
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,759
and you're able to book tickets without

160
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,199
actually going through with your order

161
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,160
first

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
and um users are able to

163
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
see that you've actually booked these

164
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,120
tickets so you're able to

165
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,520
just book as many tickets as you want

166
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,160
but don't

167
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,120
actually um purchase those which is

168
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,800
which qualifies as a dos attack and

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,000
using kind of same logic in

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,639
incorrect validation also qualifies as a

171
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,319
logic vulnerability

172
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,440
where let's take for example a

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
loyalty program hack where an attacker

174
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,319
buys a product gets points for it and

175
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,080
then immediately cancels the purchase

176
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,520
but still has those points

177
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
so now we're going to move on to

178
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,880
methodologies so usually when i used to

179
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,759
look at a pen test or bug bounty target

180
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,800
i would look at

181
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,360
the in-scope targets first which are

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,400
basically

183
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
the targets that a company explicitly

184
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,599
lists out

185
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,080
that they'll accept reports for and

186
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
instead of actually looking at the

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,080
targets first i would immediately start

188
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,759
with enumeration

189
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,800
and look for open ports ips etc and then

190
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
find vulnerable services

191
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
try um assisted manual exploitation with

192
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,960
something like burp

193
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,720
or oauth set attack proxy

194
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,639
and maybe try to find some outdated

195
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
versions of the service running

196
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,840
and search for perhaps an rc or remote

197
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,199
code execution

198
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,879
um in exploit db but

199
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,800
there's something missing so what

200
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,479
exactly is missing

201
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,199
and that's actually interacting with the

202
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,720
application itself

203
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,400
before starting the entire enumeration

204
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,919
process

205
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,960
so what are we looking for well on the

206
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
basic level we're just looking for logic

207
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,080
vulnerabilities

208
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
we're looking for interesting plain text

209
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,319
parameters or plain text cookies

210
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,440
which i talked about in um parameter

211
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,520
exploitation uh a couple slides ago

212
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,840
in relation to um proves

213
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
or you could talk about instead of them

214
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,039
being plain text

215
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,120
they're under basic encryption like

216
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,639
basics d4

217
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,640
and you're able to immediately decode

218
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,719
those cookies for parameters

219
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,240
and still manage to exploit the service

220
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,159
and as um previously said before um

221
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,680
html injection is also a pretty big

222
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,120
vulnerability

223
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,800
which hints at possible further

224
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,480
vulnerabilities which you can chain

225
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,200
for privileged escalation and one of the

226
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,320
biggest points

227
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
um that i have to make in this

228
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,440
presentation

229
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,680
is that one of the biggest things that

230
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,959
you need to look for

231
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,760
are users with different privileges like

232
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,000
an

233
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,720
admin an owner someone with less

234
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,680
privileges

235
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
and then you're going to try to find

236
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,040
different services which allow you to

237
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,560
escalate those

238
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,680
and finally information disclosure at

239
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,880
the end of the day information

240
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
disclosure is

241
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,920
probably one of the most important um

242
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
aspects

243
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
of finding any vulnerability because you

244
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,519
never know how

245
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,880
how interesting and useful that

246
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,480
information will be on the long run

247
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,480
so moving on i'm going to give a quick

248
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,920
overview of my accidental cves

249
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,080
which i got back in middle school i

250
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,839
think in 8th grade

251
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,519
from getting kicked out of an imessage

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,720
group chat for spamming means and

253
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,959
i was really bored and i found a

254
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,560
critical privilege escalation

255
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
vulnerability

256
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,600
which was affected in ios

257
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,480
up to ios 13.6 and ipad os 13.6 while

258
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,079
um i found another one right after

259
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,839
which was also privileged escalation and

260
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,920
followed the exact same logic

261
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
but was only affected on apple ios and

262
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,959
ipad os

263
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,240
up to 13.4.1

264
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
so to give um further insight on how

265
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,240
exactly

266
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,160
um the first one was through game pigeon

267
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,000
so if you're wondering what game pigeon

268
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,839
is it's a mobile gaming app for ios

269
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,560
devices which was

270
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,240
uh launched i think in late 2016

271
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,800
as a result of an ios 10 update which

272
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
allowed

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,240
users to interact with the messages app

274
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,600
so basically you could um send an invite

275
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,440
for a user in your dms or

276
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
in a conversation to play a game with

277
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
you which i thought was pretty fun and i

278
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,640
used to do that with my friends all the

279
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
time

280
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,240
so this cbe was this vulnerability

281
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,800
was pretty simple it was only two steps

282
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
um

283
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,880
the user would just enter a past crazy

284
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,240
eight game that they sent out from a

285
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,279
conversation

286
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,920
that they were kicked out of previously

287
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,560
and then

288
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,440
the second they join they just press the

289
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
recent button on crazy eight and the

290
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,360
user is automatically allowed back

291
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,920
to con into the conversation without an

292
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,320
invite in the first place

293
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,519
so how was i able to do it so um

294
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,120
here are some screenshots from um

295
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,720
the from the poc as you can see here

296
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,640
um i sent an invite to some of my

297
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,200
friends on an imessage conversation

298
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
to play crazy eight and then i told him

299
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,120
to kick me out

300
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,519
right after i noticed that you can still

301
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,760
enter the crazy 8 game

302
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,040
and um if you go and press the right

303
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,160
hand corner

304
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
i noticed that the reset button was

305
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,560
still available and i wondered

306
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,639
um if i'm still able to interact with

307
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,880
the game even if i'm kicked out

308
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,160
so i pressed resend and it actually sent

309
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
i wasn't expecting anything but the

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,360
second um

311
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,920
i i exited out of the crazy 8 game i

312
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,720
realized i had

313
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,920
access back into the conversation so

314
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
this was pretty mind-blowing um i didn't

315
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,040
know what to say

316
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
and i tried it out on different devices

317
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,399
i thought this was just mine but i

318
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,680
realized this is

319
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,959
an actual flaw so

320
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,480
after messing around with some of my

321
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,240
friends for a bit

322
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,440
i decided to report it to apple and i

323
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
got a cbe for it

324
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,600
so from there on out i got really

325
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
interested in

326
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,279
the same vulnerability because if that

327
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,399
happened

328
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,279
in game pigeon who knows um where else

329
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,560
it could happen

330
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,440
and matter of fact i was right because

331
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,839
there

332
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,959
is a feature in imessage called digital

333
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,440
touch

334
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,639
and same exact flaw was

335
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,399
present there too except with an

336
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,800
additional step

337
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,600
so basically in an imessage group the

338
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,279
attacker who we can refer to

339
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,440
as user one would send a digital touch

340
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
message

341
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
similar to how you send an invite to

342
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,200
the users to play crazy a and then

343
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,279
the receiving users who will use as a

344
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,560
collective term as

345
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,880
user two would then remove user one from

346
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,240
the group

347
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,880
and then user one would actually go back

348
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,800
into the previously sent digital touch

349
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,399
message and edit it

350
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,560
so similar to how we were able to go

351
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
back to the crazy 8 game

352
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,320
and mess around with it we're able to do

353
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,040
the same exact thing with digital touch

354
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,680
so after editing and sending the message

355
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,880
you're able to

356
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,240
gain back access into the conversation

357
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
so to provide more insight into that

358
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,440
here are some screenshots

359
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,880
i asked one of my friends to

360
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,720
kick me out of conversation right after

361
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,279
i sent a digital touch message

362
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,880
and if you didn't know once you get

363
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
kicked out of a conversation

364
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,279
you can't review the message history

365
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,320
right after

366
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
but you're able to view message history

367
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,720
before and i was able to go back into

368
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,320
the digital touch message

369
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,680
and edit it so

370
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
i was able to edit the message and if

371
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
you look at the

372
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,760
the bottom right hand corner i was able

373
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,560
to send it

374
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,079
and the second you send it you get

375
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,959
access back into conversation

376
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,440
so um wow this ended a bit early but

377
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,199
um based a basic review of this um

378
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,320
this vulnerability it's that you

379
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,720
um said logic vulnerabilities are pretty

380
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,920
underrated

381
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,320
while you're working in let's say a bug

382
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
bounty um program

383
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,399
where most people just jump into

384
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,680
automated scanners

385
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,560
or start manual assisted exploitation or

386
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,880
work with metasploit etc

387
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,240
but the core thing is to just

388
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,000
work and interact with the application

389
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,639
first realize how it works look at the

390
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,320
different features

391
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,680
and just learn

392
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,079
from the application before you start

393
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,399
exploitation

394
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,959
so here are my contacts if you want to

395

and that's my twitter thank you

401

awesome um let me just check i think

402
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,360
we've had

403
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,560
a few questions so you covered a

404
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,839
lot of content give me a second

405
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,360
um do we actually have any questions for

406
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,240
you

407
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
let me take a look i mean i have a

408
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,800
question for you so i'm just gonna

409
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
inject myself into this conversation

410
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,079
more than i already do

411
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,600
um yeah uh you basically

412
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,480
obtained two cvs by um getting you know

413
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
uh

414
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
accidentally kicked out of uh imessage

415
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,839
rooms have you tried

416
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,560
replicating this um so you've tried

417
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,680
replicating this with

418
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,839
another app at work right but have you

419
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,639
tried um

420
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,800
okay once you you know disclosed it

421
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
they fixed it have you tried doing

422
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,399
similar things uh to see if

423
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,000
a maybe a variation of that bug uh

424
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,759
wasn't patched or something like that

425
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,519
yeah i've tried that multiple times

426
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,720
but um according to the staff at apple

427
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
um apple security they said that they

428
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,399
fixed that they fixed the issue and they

429
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,639
said it was an issue with tapax

430
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,399
which basically allowed the user back

431
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,839
into the conversation so

432
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,120
um even previously before when i was

433
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,079
looking at the

434
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,199
um the next cve which i found or um

435
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,839
digital touch i decided that if i found

436
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,519
this there must be something else so

437
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,519
i was looking through often but i think

438
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,279
it only affected um

439
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,959
game pigeon and digital touch

440
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,120
awesome okay we

441
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,160
i mean everyone is very very uh

442
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,199
very happy uh also yeah

443
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,359
congrats on the action accidental cvs

444
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,880
for everyone also

445
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,319
like usually you you go into this

446
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,119
trying to to find a cv you just don't

447
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,520
click on the wrong thing yeah

448
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,799
i mean i mean like when i started off i

449
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,039
had no idea what a cve was

450
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,280
and to be honest i was expecting um a

451
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,240
buck brownie

452
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,880
like of like thousands of dollars so

453
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
when i got a cv i got pissed off

454
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,000
but then um i kind of but then like

455
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,080
after i did some ctfs i got more into

456
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,440
the infosec industry

457
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,280
i realized that cbds are a pretty big

458
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
thing i should be proud of that

459
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
yeah that is so awesome to hear that's

460
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,799
really impressive

461
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
i'd also like to thank you for coming

462
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,760
out and speaking for us today i'd like

463
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,200
to thank all of our speakers who took

464
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,799
the time to sort of

465
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,760
uh you know present what they they have

466
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,320
prepared

467
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,559
their knowledge you know everything it's

468
