00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,120
hi there my name is josephine and i'm

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,200
here to teach you how to save lives with

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,320
a smartphone

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,559
it's a pretty ambitious statement but

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,839
stick with me i'll walk you through it

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,080
we'll go step by step

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,920
first a little bit of intro a background

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,439
on who i am so

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,600
i have completed my undergraduate in

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
biomedical engineering at ucl

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,160
and then i went on to do a self-directed

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,279
master's um

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,960
self-directed just means i didn't pick

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,479
one of the projects available

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,640
came up with my own thing the reason i

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,960
did that was because in my second year

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,280
i stumbled onto a big lab full of very

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,800
expensive medical equipment called

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,559
colorimetry machines

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,200
and these are basically very very

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
precise measurements

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,360
of the color of this particular surface

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,800
it's needed for a lot of diagnostic

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,760
tools

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,079
and i said to my professor at the time i

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,440
bet you this could be done on a

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,719
smartphone

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,960
he turned around to me and said no no it

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
can't otherwise we wouldn't be paying up

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,239
to a million pounds for a colorimetry

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,120
machine

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,040
and of course the only logical thing i

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,240
could do at that point was spend the

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,520
next three years of my life

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,159
proving him wrong this started with a

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,920
six-week internship where i put together

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,840
a rough proof of concept

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,759
but once i saw that it was possible

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,600
there was no stopping me

40
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,560
i did a complete masters on it and put

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,119
together

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,520
this app what i managed to do was learn

43
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,960
a fair bit about app development

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,000
quite a lot about medical laws and a

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
little bit about diagnostic techniques

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
what i am now trying to do is teach

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,400
myself some cyber security stuff

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,880
just the basics um and i'm really really

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,600
enjoying that

50
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,079
looking to learn more so in this

51
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,280
presentation i'm going to walk you

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
through the ins and outs the real

53
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
technical stuff behind this app

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,560
in the vague hope that someone out there

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,399
could help me progress my knowledge

56
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,200
on the cyber security side of things now

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,640
as i started my journey into cyber

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,000
security the first thing i

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,280
learned and something that you guys

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,119
should all be very familiar with is that

61
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,960
the best way to tackle a problem

62
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,200
is understand the threat you're facing

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,960
now the threat here

64
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,000
is neonatal jaundice that's a medical

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,399
term

66
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,280
that basically means neonatal affecting

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,160
a baby

68
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
and jaundice jaundice is a bit more

69
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,599
complicated so we're gonna need a new

70
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,720
slide

71
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,200
jaundice is a term used to describe the

72
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,560
yellowing of the skin

73
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,800
and the whites of the eyes it's caused

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
by a buildup of a waste product called

75
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,720
bilirubin it's this yellow orange bile

76
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
that's produced when your body

77
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,319
breaks down red blood cells that it no

78
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,000
longer needs now

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
usually bilirubin's not a big problem

80
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,360
it's produced by your body all the time

81
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
it's filtered out like any other waste

82
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
product

83
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,080
it's a very delicate balance just like

84
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
all biology is and when that balance is

85
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,959
disrupted

86
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,319
and this can happen in a whole lot of

87
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,400
different ways bilirubin builds up in

88
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,280
your bloodstream

89
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,120
at high levels it can cause abdominal

90
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
pain fever

91
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,800
weakness fatigue and if it passes

92
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
through the blood-brain barrier it can

93
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,560
cause more serious disabilities and even

94
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
death

95
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,319
it's definitely something we're trying

96
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,560
to avoid and it's a really common

97
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,519
problem as well

98
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,239
it affects up to 80 percent of premature

99
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:02,959
births

100
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,159
and up to 60 of full term births

101
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,440
it's really serious it causes 114 000

102
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
infant deaths every year so why haven't

103
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,080
we all heard of it

104
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,640
well that's because while difficult to

105
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,440
prevent

106
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,680
with early diagnosis jaundice can be

107
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,560
easily treated

108
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080
milder cases can be treated using

109
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,159
phototherapy which is basically just

110
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,360
exposure to uv light and oxygen and more

111
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
severe cases can be treated using a

112
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,879
process called exchange transfusion

113
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,000
which is really just a complicated

114
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,879
blood transfusion if it's so treatable

115
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,519
then

116
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,760
why are we still seeing so many deaths

117
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,879
the clue is in

118
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,120
where these deaths are occurring three

119
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,200
quarters of them happen in sub-saharan

120
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,920
africa

121
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,120
and south asia it's worse in this region

122
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
for a whole number of different

123
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
factors but the two main are an

124
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
increased likelihood of certain genetic

125
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,040
risk factors like g6pd deficiency

126
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,959
and the difficulty in diagnosing in this

127
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
region traditional methods include

128
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,000
visual inspection

129
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
which is basically looking at an infant

130
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,360
and seeing if there's any yellowing to

131
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,239
the skin

132
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,760
and this is much more difficult in

133
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,519
infants with darker skin tones

134
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,280
it's just more difficult to detect

135
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,720
yellow in the skin

136
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,120
in darker skin and that's the current

137
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
standard practice

138
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,959
what we need is a reliable low-cost

139
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,160
screening solution

140
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,960
which works regardless of skin tone so

141
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
what are the options

142
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,080
there are lots of different diagnostic

143
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
techniques the gold standard and what

144
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,759
would happen in the uk hospital is if a

145
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,160
baby is suspected of having jaundice

146
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,759
they are given a blood test this

147
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,440
determines the concentration of that

148
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,680
chemical bilirubin in their blood

149
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
this is gold standard diagnostic

150
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
technique but it's just not feasible for

151
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,639
many people

152
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,120
it requires expensive medical equipment

153
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,440
and an invasive procedure a blood test

154
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
that a lot of parents are really wary

155
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
about plus that equipment needs to be

156
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,759
stored in a hospital

157
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,479
it's not very transportable current

158
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,759
alternative diagnosis

159
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,880
techniques are no better we have

160
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,800
that skin tone testing you can see in

161
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,919
this image here

162
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,400
we use a reference strip to compare the

163
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,320
yellowness of the skin tone

164
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,800
to reference squares and this is much

165
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,479
more difficult in infants with darker

166
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
skin tones

167
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,880
the other main alternative is scleral

168
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,120
testing the sclera is the white of your

169
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,919
eye

170
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,840
and this is a pretty consistent color

171
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
across babies of all skin tones

172
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,919
so we look at that to measure yellowing

173
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,240
in the white of the eye

174
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,160
this is mainly done using those really

175
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
expensive colorimetry machines that i

176
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,560
mentioned

177
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280
earlier so i thought what if we could do

178
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,160
all of this

179
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
using a smartphone wouldn't that be neat

180
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,240
in theory yes the theory here is to

181
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,400
build an app which uses two images of

182
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,759
the whites of the eyes

183
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,240
to screen for neonital jaundice this has

184
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,600
only recently become

185
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
a possibility due to the evolution of

186
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,960
two things firstly

187
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,080
the smartphones that we put into camera

188
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,400
the smartphone cameras that we have now

189
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,919
in modern smartphones

190
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,759
the sensitivity has just increased

191
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,000
massively over recent years

192
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,240
and also the technology in the phone we

193
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
need a high level of processing power to

194
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,479
be running

195
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,520
this kind of analysis and that has only

196
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,120
recently become possible

197
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,440
i mentioned a pair of images here as a

198
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,360
flash and a non-flash image

199
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,039
the reason we need to do this is because

200
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,720
as i'm sure you'll all be familiar with

201
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
if you sit under a blue light everything

202
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
around you starts to look blue if you

203
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,160
sit under a yellow light

204
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,000
everything will start to look yellow

205
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,479
that's the effect of ambient lighting

206
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
which can look really cool but

207
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
unfortunately isn't the best for

208
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,280
accurate diagnosis

209
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,039
we need to get rid of this effect all

210
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,560
together and we do that

211
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
using subtraction methodology so we take

212
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,120
a picture with flash on

213
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
pitch with flash off we subtract the

214
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
values of one from the other

215
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,160
so what we're left with is a composite

216
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,400
image made only of the light that is

217
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,199
collected from

218
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,440
the flash itself the ambient light

219
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,319
therefore has no

220
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,840
impact um it's just the flash which we

221
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,280
know because we can control for that we

222
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,720
know exactly what the flash is on all

223
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
the different phones

224
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
the color the temperature all of those

225
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,960
things

226
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
this means that the app in theory can be

227
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
used anywhere it can use outside in a

228
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
hospital under home lighting

229
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,759
it's really flexible and doesn't need to

230
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,039
be done in a particular environment

231
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,479
i'd like to take a brief moment here to

232
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,080
say i didn't do this on my own

233
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,759
this app was built around the amazing

234
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,360
science put out by djam

235
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
that's detecting jaundice and african

236
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,759
newborns a ucl research group but it's

237
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,759
also contributed to by academics all

238
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,800
over the world

239
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,039
in fact this is supported by a number of

240
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,800
different charitable organizations

241
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,479
i put them up on screen here and i

242
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,919
really really really appreciate that

243
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,759
help and support through all of this

244
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,120
they have been amazing not only did we

245
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,479
have academics and charitable

246
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,000
institutions we also had contact with

247
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
amazing medical staff

248
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
here i've put two up i'd just like to

249
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,039
shout them out doctor christophel and dr

250
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:47,759
judith

251
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,919
dr christobel is an associate professor

252
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,599
of pediatrics at the ghana school of

253
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,800
medicine and dentistry

254
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
and she's a consultant pediatrician at

255
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,639
akra general hospital dr judith is the

256
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,319
consultant neonatologist working at

257
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
university college london hospital

258
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,720
along with them and their entire team of

259
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,319
neonatal care

260
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,919
and the midwives and the community

261
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,639
healthcare nurses we had fantastic input

262
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,759
on this app and they were involved

263
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,240
through every step of the process

264
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
but what that meant is we focused on

265
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,599
user-driven development

266
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,639
we didn't want to build something that

267
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,000
just worked for us we wanted to build

268
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,199
something that worked for the people who

269
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,000
were actually going to use this app

270
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,199
when i mentioned earlier i did that

271
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,120
six-week prototype i put together an app

272
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,560
which i thought was the best it was

273
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
highly customizable

274
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,360
and it had all of these different

275
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
features it could be used to diverse

276
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,399
range of conditions and had great

277
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,200
feedback

278
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
so every step you had a click or a snap

279
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,519
so you knew exactly what's going on

280
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
i showed this to a bunch of midwives and

281
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,679
nurses and community healthcare workers

282
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,958
and they all said

283
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,080
it's great but get rid of sound it

284
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
massively disturbs the infants

285
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
if you're trying to take a picture and

286
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
you make a click noise they blink they

287
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,440
move

288
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
they're trying to hit the camera because

289
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,120
they think it's a toy make it silent

290
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
so i did they also wanted something way

291
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,839
more simple than what i'd put together

292
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,120
this is because they're dealing with a

293
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
baby and i don't know if you've ever

294
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,839
interacted with a baby

295
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,000
they move a lot and trying to take a

296
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
clear image of the

297
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,080
eye of a baby is really difficult they

298
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
need the app to be as simple as possible

299
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,480
to help with this process so we know

300
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
vaguely what we want

301
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,720
let's design it this is user interface

302
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,040
development which is driven by the users

303
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,720
so it's got intuitive design and minimal

304
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,160
use of language that's what they told me

305
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,720
were the top

306
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
priorities we don't want to read things

307
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
we just want to be able to go through

308
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,120
the app as soon as possible

309
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,959
it needs to be intuitive because no one

310
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,720
has time to be sitting down for a

311
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,760
training session

312
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,399
they've got lives to save very valid i

313
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,600
can work with that

314
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
so you broke the app down into four main

315
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,880
stages

316
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,279
first the camera this is a full screen

317
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,480
display of what you're looking at

318
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,680
through the camera

319
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,600
so you can just focus on centering the

320
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,279
image getting the right bits in

321
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,040
it's got a small counter at the top you

322
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,560
can see it's currently on zero that

323
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,399
clicks up every time you take an image

324
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,839
so you can see how many you've taken in

325
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,760
that session there is a

326
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
large camera button that is just click

327
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,279
once take a picture

328
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,440
no more fast than that really simple and

329
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
a little check mark when you're done

330
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,320
taking images so you can move on to the

331
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,040
next stage

332
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,519
so what it looks like uh that's not a

333
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,360
real baby but it is how the app would

334
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
work in real life

335
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
after that you're shown this screen now

336
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,000
this can look a little confusing so i'll

337
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,880
walk you through it

338
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,399
what you're seeing here is actually two

339
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,920
images one on top of the other

340
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,959
kind of looks like that in real life um

341
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,040
and a square in the middle is clear on

342
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
the screen so that yellow square you see

343
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,839
in the middle

344
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,399
is the sample area the reason we're

345
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,760
showing you two images is because we

346
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,040
display both the flash

347
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
and the non-flash image so you can see

348
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,640
if there's an issue with either image if

349
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,839
the baby has blinked

350
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
moved if the image is blurry there

351
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,120
wasn't enough light

352
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,399
then you can just delete that pair of

353
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,240
images not a problem just click that

354
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
delete button

355
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,560
what you want to do is zoom and pan

356
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
those images to create a sample

357
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
now it's quite difficult to fill an

358
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
entire camera screen with just the white

359
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,839
of the eye of a baby that's a really

360
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,040
small area

361
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
usually you get some face you get some

362
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
eyelid you have some hair

363
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,160
so what we needed to do was create a

364
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
sample of that image because we just

365
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,200
want to look at the color of the white

366
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,320
of the eye

367
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,720
this is my face in the example image and

368
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,440
a color

369
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
testing machine which you wouldn't need

370
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,279
so you zoom in using an intuitive pinch

371
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,320
to zoom technique

372
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,440
and then just a drag to pan to center

373
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,959
that little square you see in the middle

374
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,200
over an area that is entirely the white

375
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,920
of the eye

376
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,079
that's all we're interested in here so

377
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,160
once you get the sample area in the

378
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,760
right place and it's not obstructed by

379
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,079
any

380
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,760
veins going through the eye or any

381
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,839
shadows or any eyelashes

382
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,440
and you click the plus by the check mark

383
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,839
to proceed on and then we only look at

384
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,880
that tiny square

385
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,160
as moving forward once you've done that

386
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,600
and you've done it a few times because

387
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,360
this is science and we love to average

388
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,160
things

389
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,760
uh you move on to the results screen

390
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,440
that's going to pop out a result from

391
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,560
scb

392
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,120
um which is just a billerometer reading

393
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
and a diagnosis

394
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
because we want to make this simple for

395
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
the end users so it's going to say does

396
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
this baby need further investigation for

397
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
jaundice yes or no

398
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,519
and a confidence reading so that people

399
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,639
can feel confident

400
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,360
in the output of this app now as a

401
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,800
research project we need slightly more

402
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,240
than that so we've also got an advanced

403
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,279
results screen

404
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,720
this is just for the researchers it's

405
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,839
going to show you all of the different

406
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,200
specs through the app

407
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,560
so that we can test how well it's

408
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
working

409
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,320
so now we've designed it that's pretty

410
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,040
much it nope got to build it

411
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
we decided to use an android interface

412
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,480
because you have way more control over

413
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,600
the camera

414
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,680
they've got this handy camera to api

415
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,120
which is a fairly recent

416
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,200
release it's an application programming

417
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,720
interface it's basically

418
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
a framework a bunch of functions

419
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,040
programmers can use to build their own

420
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
apps

421
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,120
the camera 2 is one of the most advanced

422
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,639
in terms of the level of control it

423
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,920
gives you over the functions of the

424
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,040
smartphone camera

425
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,480
you can control things like the white

426
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,040
balance the exposure rating

427
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,880
the time it takes to take a picture all

428
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,079
of that

429
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,680
unfortunately it doesn't give us quite

430
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,519
enough control this camera capture

431
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,839
session is the biggest issue here

432
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,320
and when you take an image it's

433
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,680
converted from raw

434
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,639
into jpeg sounds a bit confusing let me

435
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,760
break down

436
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,680
this is what the inside of your camera

437
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,040
looks like not

438
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,639
exactly technically this is a scientific

439
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,079
representation of the process but that

440
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:14,320
is

441
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,120
nearly as exciting it's a bayer matrix

442
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,360
it is a series of light sensors

443
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,040
blue green and red laid out in a grid

444
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
four of these together a little square

445
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,959
forms a pixel that's the basic component

446
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,839
of an image

447
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,839
it's an average of the blue green and

448
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,000
red color readings

449
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,279
you can see that there's twice as many

450
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,880
green as any other color that's because

451
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,639
the human eye is very very sensitive to

452
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,440
green light

453
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,959
and it's the most important to making an

454
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,120
image look good

455
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,440
when you take a picture raw image data

456
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,120
is captured from these light sensors and

457
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,040
then it's converted into an image

458
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,279
if you just displayed the data coming in

459
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,720
it's going to look really green because

460
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
it's weighted towards green

461
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,920
and also just not very nice to look at

462
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,519
it's got blank pixels

463
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,519
and masked pixels which are around the

464
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,279
edge they don't capture any light

465
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,480
they're just there to show the edge of

466
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,399
the image and it wouldn't be adjusted

467
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,800
for anything like white balance

468
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,360
unfortunately we are trying to build a

469
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,720
medical device

470
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
not a camera to display pretty images so

471
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,399
we need the actual raw image data

472
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,680
this is really difficult to get a hold

473
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,600
of there is no standardized format for

474
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,199
raw sensor image data

475
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,639
and the format of these files can differ

476
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,959
significantly between phone models

477
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,560
the differences include color filter

478
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,120
arrangement orientation masks pixels

479
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,519
many other characteristics luckily they

480
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,800
will come with a header that's a few

481
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,160
bytes at the beginning of the file

482
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,519
which gives you this information if you

483
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,279
can decode it it's quite tricky

484
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,519
and so we'll build a custom module to

485
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,760
convert from raw sensor image data to a

486
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,000
tiff that's a tagged image file format

487
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,839
a tiff6 specifically which is a

488
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,120
standardized raw

489
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
image format currently this is only hard

490
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
coded for a couple of phone multiples

491
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,880
um the samsung s8 and the nexus but in

492
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,160
future production we hope that this can

493
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,839
be widened to a whole range of different

494
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,079
phones

495
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,399
this is what the app actually looks like

496
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,519
in terms of a diagram

497
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,800
of our interface we built our own custom

498
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
microservices architecture

499
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,399
really maintainable very easy to test in

500
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,639
different sections

501
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
and we put individual fragments which

502
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
are hosted on the main activity of the

503
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:14,880
app

504
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,720
as you can see the raw analysis section

505
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,320
is quite significant that's because it

506
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,920
takes a lot of processing to get this

507
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
image to where we need it to be

508
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,519
we subtract the image we look at the

509
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,920
sample area we figure out the exact

510
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,040
values coming in from all those

511
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,160
different light sensors

512
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,480
we average it to get a color reading in

513
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
rgb and also an xyz chromaticity reading

514
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,360
and then we compare that using a

515
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,279
brilliant algorithm designed by the djan

516
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,079
team

517
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,120
to various different color specs for

518
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,040
how yellow is the eye is there a level

519
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,240
of the ribbon there

520
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,279
does this child have jaundice of course

521
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,720
you have to calibrate this kind of app

522
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
every camera is completely different and

523
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,000
every flash is different flash might be

524
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,240
more yellow more white or blue and we

525
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,920
need to calibrate so we do that using

526
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,519
these handy swatches

527
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,759
we know exactly what color these patches

528
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,839
are and we can measure that using the

529
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,360
app and then compare the results that

530
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,120
we're getting to the real result of the

531
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,560
color

532
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,320
and this allows us to calibrate the app

533
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
unfortunately what this means is that

534
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
the app can't just be sent out and

535
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,920
downloaded onto people's phones

536
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,839
it needs to be calibrated preferably in

537
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,480
a dark room an academic environment

538
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,720
and then the results need to be put into

539
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,240
a calibration algorithm we currently

540
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,360
have it written in matlab

541
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,320
on a desktop computer and fed back into

542
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,839
the phone to calibrate it for that

543
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,360
individual phone's camera sensor and

544
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,320
that's not just model

545
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,240
phone individual phone we need this to

546
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,040
be really really accurate

547
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
that's something else that we're working

548
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,399
on at the moment

549
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,480
another thing is security you can

550
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,680
probably tell by the fact that this

551
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,120
slide has come quite late on in the

552
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,759
presentation

553
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,120
security wasn't something we worked on

554
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,399
from the beginning of the project it's

555
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,600
something we realized we needed

556
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,399
later that's never a good start i want

557
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,759
to give you a bit of a background on the

558
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,519
situation that this app is being used in

559
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,880
so you can understand the security

560
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,399
problems we're facing

561
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,560
this app is being used on work phones

562
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,160
phones given out by the organizations

563
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,440
that i mentioned earlier and also

564
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,480
personal phones

565
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,079
belonging to community healthcare

566
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,959
workers these are amazing nurses

567
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,199
midwives and general healthcare workers

568
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,839
who go out into remote regions

569
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,359
regions that really struggle to access

570
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,039
healthcare and perform

571
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,119
basic medical treatment and diagnosis

572
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,319
there

573
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,919
this means that they have very limited

574
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,599
access to the internet um

575
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,520
and they often don't aren't able to

576
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,039
download the latest firmware and the

577
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,240
latest patches

578
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,160
leaving them really vulnerable to cyber

579
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
attacks as well as that we wanted to

580
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,000
transmit the data back to a medical

581
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
setting so it can be followed up on if

582
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,280
any children needed

583
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,480
further treatment and our first couple

584
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,960
of trials we just sent unencrypted data

585
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,640
straight over the internet to the

586
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,559
hospital not ideal

587
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,760
it's really not ideal so this is really

588
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,919
vulnerable it's also high priority data

589
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,039
it's medical data

590
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,520
very personal it can't be changed and it

591
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,559
indicates people who are really

592
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,000
emotionally vulnerable by going through

593
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,280
something really scary

594
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
their child has just been potentially

595
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,960
diagnosed with jaundice a condition that

596
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,240
they know to be serious

597
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,480
and they're probably quite scared that

598
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,919
leaves them really vulnerable to

599
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,080
exploiting that being exploited by

600
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,200
attackers and malicious actors

601
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
besides the point this is also a medical

602
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
device medical software counts as a

603
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,039
medical device in most countries around

604
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,960
the world and therefore it needs to pass

605
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,080
medical devices certification standards

606
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
these vary around the world up here i've

607
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,200
put four just

608
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,440
basic laws from the uk eu and the us

609
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,200
and if in order for a medical device to

610
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
be made available in the country it has

611
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
to be certified

612
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
we looked at all of the different

613
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,160
certification standards around the world

614
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,200
and we found

615
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,160
that the eu and uk procedures which are

616
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,280
still fairly similar

617
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,600
brexit not with landing and these are

618
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,679
the strictest right so if you pass this

619
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,720
certification

620
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,000
a lot of different countries will give

621
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,919
you a head start in passing theirs

622
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,760
for example in ghana you get to skip the

623
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,120
first couple of steps in the

624
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,559
certification process

625
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,919
if you're already eu certified

626
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,679
now there's a lot of different specs for

627
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,960
what has to

628
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,640
a medical device has to go through to

629
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,799
pass this certification

630
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,559
in terms of accuracy in terms of

631
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,120
provable testing but cyber security is a

632
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,760
major component especially for software

633
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,160
and we are just not passing those specs

634
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,520
at the moment

635
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,600
our data transfer solution for example

636
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,280
is to just do it manually we're just not

637
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,720
sending over the internet we are keeping

638
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
these phones 100 offline

639
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,240
all of the data is localized they're not

640
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,080
even kept internet and we take the data

641
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,520
manually back to a hospital

642
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,840
and transfer it there great short term

643
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,520
solution not a feasible long-term

644
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,640
solution

645
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,880
uh other idea is to ask for help uh if

646
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,799
anyone out there has any experience

647
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,000
in app security and wants to be generous

648
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,280
and donate their time

649
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,000
i would love to learn more um my contact

650
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,520
details are going to be up at the end of

651
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,799
this slide

652
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,120
um and yeah reach out to me also if you

653
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,559
have any questions after this feel free

654
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,000
to reach out

655
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
i would really really appreciate it

656
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,360
let's talk about the testing we're doing

657
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,080
currently

658
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
we're testing in two locations we have

659
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
tests ongoing in the uk

660
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,120
that's in uclh and tesco on an accra in

661
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,320
ghana

662
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
these tests are currently taking place

663
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,520
in hospitals

664
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,960
because we need to be able to compare

665
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
the results that we're getting to blood

666
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
tests that's the gold standard i

667
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,679
mentioned earlier

668
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,919
to see how accurately we are able to

669
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:18,799
predict

670
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,840
the bilirubin levels in blood this is

671
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,520
the first stage of testing

672
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,720
and we just want to do a proof of

673
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
concept basically again and to prove

674
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,919
that this idea

675
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,240
could work it's a really really exciting

676
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,480
idea but like all medical the progress

677
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,200
is slow

678
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,039
in terms of proving that it's safe

679
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,360
effective and accurate

680
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,039
once we finish testing these locations

681
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,159
we're going to be trying to pass through

682
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,799
medical device certifications

683
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,720
put it out there as a medical device on

684
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,559
the market we're going to be expanding

685
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,720
into other areas taking it for field

686
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
tests testing under a whole range of

687
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,240
conditions

688
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,840
trying to improve the app at every

689
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,919
process every step in the process

690
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,520
getting lots and lots of feedback from

691
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
community medical workers

692
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,799
on what they like about the app what we

693
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,480
could improve

694
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
and yeah we're going to be taking it

695
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,120
forward and hopefully saving a lot of

696
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,919
lives

697
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,400
that's the idea thank you so much for

698
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,520
listening to me today i hope you've

699
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,039
learned something from this talk

700
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,559
and i would love to get your questions

701
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,240
if you have any questions afterwards

702
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,919
reach out to me here are my social media

703
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,240
handles i'm very approachable

704
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
thank you so much so first can i start

705
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,520
by saying

706
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,760
wow that's wow

707
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
also a lot more than well but let's say

708
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,760
we're gonna stick with a moment that was

709
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,960
fantastic

710
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,159
you just blew everybody away in chat uh

711
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,679
oh my goodness my discord started

712
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,960
blowing up people are like this is

713
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,640
illegal to view this for free oh my

714
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,520
goodness

715
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,159
so congrats you have an amazing talk we

716
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,000
have lots of questions for you

717
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
perfect finished a bit early so we've

718
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,200
got time for them all

719
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,080
perfect would you like to start us off

720
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,400
uh

721
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,600
atomic i can indeed um

722
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,799
so you've been at this for a certain

723
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,559
while uh you said three years

724
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,679
yes um in so

725
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,360
you're starting you know from an

726
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
academic context and then progressing

727
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
into you know

728
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,440
this massive context with a lot of

729
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,840
different actors

730
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,600
um how long

731
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,360
does the development of such an app

732
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,039
especially with the whole certifications

733
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,000
coming afterwards

734
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,240
usually take like uh as an industry

735
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,520
standard

736
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
so it's a fairly recent thing that

737
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,120
people are building medical apps

738
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,720
um that are going to be certified as

739
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,240
medical devices

740
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
and also my circumstances were quite

741
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,760
unusual when i say three years

742
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,000
i started in my second year in my spare

743
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,360
time this was a hobby

744
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,240
i did a summer studentship and then i

745
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,159
worked on it through my undergrad just

746
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,679
yeah in my free time with the help of

747
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,520
some really supportive professors

748
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,880
and then i took it on full-time as

749
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
masters um it's still

750
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,400
undergoing development now i finished my

751
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,760
master's last year um but obviously

752
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,320
i didn't get it finished in that time uh

753
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,280
to finish an app

754
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,760
like this usually takes about five years

755
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,840
and then certification can take anywhere

756
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,799
up to ten

757
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,559
that's just because you need provable

758
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,919
results right you need to be able to

759
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,520
replicate those results over and over

760
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:05,919
again

761
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,440
you need to be sure that this is

762
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
accurate and that it's safe

763
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,400
safety's less of an issue here because

764
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,480
we're really just taking pictures um

765
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,400
it's not an invasive medical procedure

766
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,360
so that's easier

767
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,200
awesome all right uh we have so many

768
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,240
questions for you still

769
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,039
uh let's see does the app work on eyes

770
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,559
of all ages even though it's specified

771
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,000
for babies or would that require a

772
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,679
different process

773
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,440
so the app would be the same and

774
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,720
actually we're looking at expanding this

775
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,400
app to other conditions as well like

776
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,520
anemia

777
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,880
um but the algorithm used to convert

778
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,000
that color result

779
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,400
into a bilirubin reading changes your

780
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
eyes actually become slightly more

781
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,799
opaque as you age and so the yellow

782
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,400
shows up slightly differently so yeah

783
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,159
the app in itself would work absolutely

784
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,279
fine it would be the same

785
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,400
but we would need to change the

786
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
algorithm within it which isn't my job

787
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,080
uh i'm more of an engineer less for

788
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,919
scientist but the brilliant people at

789
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,360
ucl and djan

790
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,559
yeah would be able to put together an

791
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,559
algorithm that does that

792
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,600
maybe that's something to look into in

793
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,720
the future definitely

794
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,919
would you like to take the next one to

795
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,880
comic yeah uh continuing on you know uh

796
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,279
okay

797
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,360
so so you mentioned a lot of um you know

798
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,320
variety of phones

799
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,799
that you need to tweak uh the the camera

800
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,440
output

801
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,799
yeah every time um

802
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,559
you know and also this being the case

803
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,919
with personal phones

804
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,200
um you have sponsors and organizations

805
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,080
helping you out you know

806
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,000
like distributing phones etc so you have

807
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
a certain baseline

808
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,279
but in let's say uh countries that don't

809
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,679
have access necessarily to all these uh

810
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,240
medical devices or even smartphones of

811
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,120
let's say

812
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,360
modern smartphones with uh with like

813
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,400
high quality cameras

814
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,720
do you think that you'll be able to help

815
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
provide this and like usher

816
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,200
an age of medical devices as smartphones

817
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,559
so that's actually the main concept of

818
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,400
this project when i say smartphones have

819
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,679
progressed to a level where we can do

820
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,080
this

821
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,679
i don't just mean the latest cutting

822
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,200
edge i mean actually about five years

823
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,080
ago as possible

824
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,440
the smartphones we were using to test

825
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,679
this project were a samsung s8

826
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,679
and a nexus 5 which is quite a few years

827
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,039
old so

828
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,559
the concept that we want to move forward

829
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,559
with is actually a donation program

830
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,720
looking at second-hand smartphones so we

831
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,760
would collect

832
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,600
um these available second-hand

833
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,559
smartphones it would have to be a

834
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,080
certain spec because the camera does

835
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,600
have to be of a certain level

836
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,880
and it doesn't have enough processing

837
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,640
power but people could donate their old

838
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,080
smartphones and then we could ship them

839
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,600
out around the world with this app on

840
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,400
them

841
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
and provide them to community healthcare

842
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,679
workers there this is also a really

843
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,279
expanding industry as i mentioned

844
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,200
so we would hope that other medical

845
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,640
device applications

846
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,000
could then be downloaded onto that phone

847
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,520
as well and it would become just a

848
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,960
general tool that they could use in

849
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,240
their community healthcare work

850
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,520
okay fantastic awesome and

851
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,039
are you planning to add features such as

852
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,559
reporting color glitches to make sure

853
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,919
the client can interact with the app to

854
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,440
provide feedback

855
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,960
yes so as i mentioned this is going to

856
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
be a really iterative process at least

857
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,080
for the next 20 years right we're going

858
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,440
to be getting feedback and we love

859
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,240
feedback

860
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,600
and we work with a lot of people on the

861
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,840
ground um with our prototypes and also

862
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,520
in our field testing

863
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
so there's yeah a whole lot of feedback

864
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
features we're asking people to fill out

865
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
surveys and quizzes and eventually there

866
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,880
will be a reporting feature built into

867
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,440
the app

868
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,799
at the moment it's a bit unnecessary

869
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,640
because everything is being reported

870
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,960
um so anything would come up in that

871
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,840
process

872
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,279
yeah so we we came back to

873
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,520
well we talked about glitches but uh

874
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,120
there's also you know uh on

875
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,559
various smartphones you have screens

876
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,320
that don't have the same color setting

877
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,679
or color depth

878
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,520
uh is that something that might have an

879
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,039
effect since you're also you know trying

880
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,600
to

881
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,559
pan to an area that has uh you know

882
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,320
indicated

883
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,880
yeah uh so it wouldn't matter as much

884
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,480
because we're not taking the reading off

885
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,279
the screen

886
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,720
we're taking the reading off that raw

887
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
image data and all we really need you to

888
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
select is a a clear section of the eye

889
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,000
that's all the same color

890
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,440
so no matter what color that appears on

891
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,799
your screen as long as it hasn't got an

892
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,559
obvious vein running through it

893
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,919
and you're not looking at the iris

894
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,520
that's the the colored part of your eye

895
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
just want the sclera just the white

896
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,440
as long as you select that area should

897
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
be absolutely fine doesn't matter what

898
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,080
color you're seeing as

899
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,840
we'll have the accurate color data from

900
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,679
that raw image

901
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,159
all right awesome and do you believe

902
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,760
automation could be useful for data

903
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,400
transfer

904
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,000
if yes do you have any requirements or

905
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,360
prereqs for this for people who might

906
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,200
want to help out with it

907
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
that is a really interesting question

908
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,279
yes it's the basic answer

909
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,799
um but as i said it's something i'm

910
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,320
still learning about myself

911
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,799
um so i believe it could be really

912
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,760
useful and

913
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,440
we did look into all sorts of automation

914
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,039
for this app and we're trying to keep it

915
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,640
fairly simple at the moment

916
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,320
just because we want it to be reliable

917
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,159
and easy to understand easy to fix in

918
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,480
the field and to make adjustments

919
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,000
um but yes automation could be really

920
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,360
useful for data transfer do i have any

921
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,240
specs

922
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,080
not off the top of my head uh feel free

923
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
to reach out to me and we could talk

924
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,679
more in detail about that

925
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,799
but yeah certainly something we're

926
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,520
interested in already

927
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,039
right we have one more question

928
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,520
for you one more how often do you see

929
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,600
attacks from threat actors on medtech

930
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,640
do you believe there's a lot of

931
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,919
awareness around this subject or do you

932
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,279
think it's not as talked about as it

933
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,399
needs to be

934
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,039
great question we see them all the time

935
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,720
uh it's a super big problem

936
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,520
especially in different communities

937
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,080
around the world

938
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,600
where cyber security is slightly less of

939
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,120
a priority perhaps

940
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,039
um this data is really really really

941
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,640
valuable right like it's

942
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,320
really personal data people don't want

943
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,240
it out there and it's really vulnerable

944
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,600
things like blackmailing schemes

945
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,960
especially diagnosis

946
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,120
information people's personal medical

947
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,159
history

948
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,320
so it's a really high priority for a lot

949
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,840
of malicious actors

950
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,520
and as i said in some areas the cyber

951
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,360
security is slightly lacking so yeah we

952
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,080
see it

953
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,679
all the time we had a couple of years

954
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,360
ago a really significant man in the

955
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,159
middle

956
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,320
attack going on for a sort of similar

957
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,840
project and when they were looking at

958
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,720
heart monitoring solutions and the

959
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,240
results of that can be really

960
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,600
devastating

961
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,679
so yeah i would say it's definitely more

962
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,960
common than people think it is

963
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,799
it needs to be talked about more we need

964
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,080
to get more collaboration between the

965
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,360
communities the medical devices

966
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,159
community

967
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,840
and cyber security it needs to become

968
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,200
more of a priority

969
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,960
definitely hoping that by doing this

970
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
talk i'm contributing a tiny bit to that

971
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,720
but yeah i would love you guys to talk

972
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,399
about it more go out test all your

973
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,679
medical devices don't

974
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,000
hack into them necessarily but yeah

975
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
something to be aware of

976
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,840
yeah thank you so much this was such a

977
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
fantastic presentation

978
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
thank you for coming out and doing this

979
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,279
with us and thank you part of this

980
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,120
and presenting all of this we really

981
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,559
appreciate it

982
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,840
no thank you guys this has been a

983
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,279
fantastic experience and i've really

984
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,480
enjoyed it

985
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,240
we did too yeah um so to everyone else

986
