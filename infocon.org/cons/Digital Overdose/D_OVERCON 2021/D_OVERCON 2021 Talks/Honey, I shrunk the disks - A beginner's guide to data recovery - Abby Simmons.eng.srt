00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,318
welcome aggie

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,799
hello okay okay were you ready to start

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,160
we are fantastic okay everyone welcome

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,119
to honey i shrunk the discs a beginner's

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:19,760
guide

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
to data recovery a little bit about me

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
before we start

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
uh i'm from south wales i'm a security

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,840
engineer

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,400
i run a free data recovery service for

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,880
the local community around south wales

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,239
and i also happen to be three red pandas

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,840
in a trench coat

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
on twitter so this is going to be broken

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,120
down into

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,039
two parts part one is your basic theory

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,399
so we're going to cover disks partitions

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
how they all work

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,280
then we're going to do file tables

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,879
what that means for us in the data

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,559
recovery process

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,840
and then file carving so how to extract

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,719
files

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,239
when we otherwise wouldn't know where

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,880
they are or how to get them

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,200
then we have part two which is going

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,880
over the equipment that you need for a

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,680
lab and the tools you need and how to

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,360
use them

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,720
so to start with we're going to have a

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,600
primer

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,640
on data storage so

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,320
your disk is organized into partitions

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,439
so your hard drive will have like c on

35
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,680
windows

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,200
and any other stuff so if you had like

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,799
two partitions you'd have your c drive

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,280
and your d

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,159
drive those partitions are a range of

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,960
blocks

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,439
on your hard drive which technically

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,799
points to sectors but we're going to

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
skip sectors

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,840
and it defines a range of bytes that we

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
can read or write to

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,479
so we can access binary directly

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,680
so this is an abstract representation

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,880
kind of a hard disk

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
there is a little block up in the top

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,920
that's blue

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
that's our mft our master file table and

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,758
that tells a computer

53
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,720
where two other files in this case are

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,080
we've got panda

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,920
and panda in snow and you see the mp4

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,160
is a little bit bigger so it takes up a

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,239
couple blocks

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,400
without anything to tell us where the

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
file is

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,239
we'd have to scan the entire disk every

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,680
time we wanted to access it it'll be

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,599
very slow

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,879
so when we format a partition it gets

64
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,280
these

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,400
file tables in windows or

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,959
on ntfs it's called the master file

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,040
table

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,280
different partitions will have different

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
things like inodes in linux

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,280
that help us easily access

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,160
things on the disk

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
this will arrange you know all the data

73
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
that you've got into files and folders

74
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,239
that your computer can then see and work

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,800
with like normal

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,280
so mft will define how big your file is

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,200
where it is and that kind of thing

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,599
now if you put something in the recycle

79
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,599
bin or you just hit normal delete on

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,040
your keyboard

81
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,159
it'll go into windows recycle bin or

82
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,239
linux trash

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,319
um at this stage the image is still

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,680
there obviously you can

85
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,239
click into your recycle bin and bring it

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,360
back

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,480
quite easily it's because there is a

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,400
record of it still in

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,760
mft so

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,840
we don't need any tools to recover that

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,000
we're not particularly concerned

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,640
but if you were to say hit shift delete

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,799
that removes it completely so

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,840
the mft doesn't have a way of telling

95
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,799
you where that file is now

96
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,080
um it's unallocated space

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
that means that whenever a new file

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,000
comes along and it's like

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,959
where can i be put on the disk then

100
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,560
it'll just go right on top of where

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,000
we've deleted the file

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,079
or there's a chance of doing that so

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,680
unallocated space is just free space on

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,199
a disk

105
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,400
but in this case there's a little hidden

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,919
panda there that could get

107
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,680
overwritten and we don't want that to

108
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,040
happen so

109
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,400
we're going to do some data recovery

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
if things get really bad your whole mft

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
could be corrupted

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
maybe your hard drive took a really bad

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
knock or

114
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,800
you tried to format your disk in a

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
really weird way and everything's just

116
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,919
gone wrong

117
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,040
so you don't have anything to tell you

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
where any of your files are

119
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,919
this is pretty rare um to have something

120
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,600
like this happen

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,320
because mft will have little mirrors so

122
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,759
copies of itself

123
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,080
throughout the disc to kind of fall back

124
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,160
on an emergency

125
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,400
but this is a nice hypothetical for the

126
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,880
situation we're about to go into

127
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,680
where we don't know where anything is so

128
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,039
we're dealing with a complete unknown

129
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,320
and we want to find

130
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,039
all of the pandas so our mft doesn't

131
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,400
tell us where anything is

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,080
there could be more than just two pandas

133
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,400
here there could be

134
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,720
all of these just hidden on your disk so

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,840
there are tools to repair the mft

136
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,680
we're going to ignore those for today

137
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,840
and we're going to go straight on to

138
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,880
a process called file carving

139
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
which is where you go block by block on

140
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,400
the disk

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,440
and you try and find something called a

142
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,160
file signature

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,520
these file signatures are little strings

144
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,479
on a disk

145
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,120
or little bits of data that tell us what

146
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,440
a file is

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
each file type has a unique signature

148
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,479
it's

149
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,600
usually defined by a standard so pngs

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,319
have the same

151
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,440
first eight bytes to them

152
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,639
and then they have an end of file

153
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,440
so what a carver will do if it has the

154
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,039
definitions it knows what to look for at

155
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,160
the start and the end

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
i'll go block by block until it finds

157
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,680
the start of the file

158
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
and it'll keep going till it hits the

159
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,880
end and it'll go

160
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,600
this is a file and alert you to do what

161
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
you want with it

162
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,600
it takes a long time to do file cards

163
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
even on small disks when i was testing

164
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,319
this

165
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,600
i had a 250 gigabyte hard drive and it

166
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
took

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,800
i think it was two hours to complete the

168
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
entire car

169
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,479
so this isn't something that you want to

170
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,639
do if you've got

171
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,759
say a two terabyte drive or if you do

172
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,039
and you're really desperate for those

173
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,319
files

174
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,440
you might want to leave it running over

175
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,800
the weekend or overnight

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,680
file carvers will need somewhere to

177
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
store their information

178
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,639
because they don't just

179
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,680
throw it back into the file table on the

180
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,039
disk that they found it

181
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,880
if they did that you'd be writing to the

182
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,280
disk you were trying to save files from

183
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,680
and you might do something dodgy to your

184
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,880
own

185
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,520
data so you might accidentally lose a

186
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,720
panda

187
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
or any file that you need so

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,919
we need a lab to work on this

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,479
or a separate disk to put all the data

190
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,199
so carvers will work in one of two ways

191
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,800
usually

192
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,639
either they'll dump all the images that

193
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,919
they find

194
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,080
or the files that they find straight

195
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,960
onto

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
a place that you've told it to

197
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,319
um that's quite heavy on data

198
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,479
you would need a lot of space and then

199
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,160
you need to sift through

200
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
to find the few images that you really

201
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
wanted to get

202
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,680
or we can use autopsy

203
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,800
which has a module called photorec

204
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,400
and what it does is it'll tell you

205
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,919
where these files are and they'll give

206
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,520
you information about them

207
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,919
so you can decide what to do with them

208
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,879
so if you had a million images

209
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,720
and you only wanted 20 of them

210
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,440
you can use a very small disc to recover

211
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
those 20 images

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
you don't have to get the thousand and

213
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
then for the million and then sort

214
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,199
through

215
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,080
to find what you want

216
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,240
so that's a quick primer on the theory

217
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
we have a five second snack break to

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
process everything before we move on

219
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,440
to the practical side of things so you

220
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
know how discs work now

221
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,760
on a basic level just enough to

222
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,600
understand the file carving process

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,120
terms of equipment that we need

224
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,760
we're going to need some kind of storage

225
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,480
drive

226
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,519
so it works on basically

227
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,560
anything that you need it for

228
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,040
um any data storage device will work as

229
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,720
long as you have the adapter to plug it

230
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,680
in

231
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
to your machine whatever you're doing

232
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,399
your data recovery on

233
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,920
so if you have a usb to sd card adapter

234
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,519
you can run microsd if you have

235
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,040
sd card adapters or sata cables you know

236
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,560
you can use anything you want because it

237
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,279
doesn't matter what the physical form

238
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,560
of the disk is as long as it is readable

239
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,959
we can work with it so i pulled the hard

240
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,800
disk for one of my servers

241
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,920
um and this is formatted in ntfs

242
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
it has a little extra reserved space on

243
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,959
it so

244
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,320
it might show up as one partition or

245
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,800
two or three depending on how we look at

246
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,760
it in autopsy

247
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,240
it's a quick review of how my lab is set

248
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
up in theory

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,240
so to recover our pandas

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,720
from our hard drive we're going to need

251
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
our

252
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,640
hard drive that i pulled out of the

253
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,600
server and then you're going to need

254
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,640
sata to usb connector just so it can

255
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,399
pull the data

256
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,120
and then our recovery lab which you can

257
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,000
just put

258
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
an operating system onto a laptop with

259
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,160
autopsy

260
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,040
i'm using an os called cane it's based

261
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,720
off of ubuntu

262
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,399
um and it can it contains autopsy

263
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
as well as a bunch of other forensic

264
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,519
investigation

265
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,720
tools which helps us not cause any

266
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,000
damage

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,560
to the disks that we're working on if

268
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,399
you don't want to sacrifice a whole pc

269
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,000
to your data recovery

270
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,839
you can just put it on a usb and do a

271
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,680
thing called live booting

272
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,560
which is where kind of your usb will act

273
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,079
as the hard drive

274
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,480
that your machine boots off of and you

275
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,920
can just use that instead

276
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,800
it's a little bit slower but it works

277
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,240
just as well if you have

278
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
a few images you want to get off of a

279
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,360
usb

280
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,760
desk or another hard drive

281
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
so this is what cane looks like

282
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
um i've arranged things so they look a

283
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,440
little bit neater there are a couple

284
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,640
extra tools that i've

285
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
disappeared to get rid of the clutter

286
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,839
we're going to be working with autopsy

287
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,200
and we're going to be working with

288
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,959
unblock

289
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,120
unblock is our right blocker which we're

290
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,200
going to check in with first

291
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,399
so unblock

292
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,240
allows you to basically choose whether

293
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,880
or not your disk is read only

294
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
so you see we've got a 40 gigabyte disk

295
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
which is our lab

296
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,120
and a 250 or 230 2.9

297
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,920
gigabyte disk which is going to be all

298
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
of our missing data

299
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,680
to change whether or not these are

300
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
readable and writeable

301
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,320
get a little tick box on the left and

302
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,839
you can just hit the ok button once it's

303
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,399
ticked

304
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,240
it'll switch it round and bring the

305
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,079
screen up again to tell you its status

306
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,079
we've given we've been given

307
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,279
the device names sda and sdb

308
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,079
this is standard linux naming convention

309
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,120
for disks

310
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,519
it'll be sd and then abc in order

311
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,720
of how the disks are connected we know

312
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,920
that we plugged in a 250 gigabyte disk

313
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,079
so the 232 is almost definitely

314
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,000
our missing data and that's how we can

315
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,120
tell

316
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,959
there are other ways of looking it up

317
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,320
but we're not going to use command line

318
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,079
today because this is for absolute

319
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,200
beginners with no prior history of using

320
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
anything

321
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,160
now sdb is read only in the stats field

322
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,279
we know we're not going to overwrite

323
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,079
anything so we can't cause problems

324
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,839
even if we trade that data is safe

325
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,680
now before you go into autopsy you can

326
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
actually just look at the disk for

327
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
things that are in the recycle bin

328
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
like we said earlier it's really easy to

329
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,120
just go into the recycle bin

330
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
and then find all your files

331
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,519
sometimes uh you want to do this

332
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,600
just before the investigation to get an

333
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,120
easy win in

334
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,600
if you're looking for files and you just

335
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,880
want

336
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,760
a quick five-second thing while the

337
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,880
disk's spinning up and while the

338
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
investigation is going on in the

339
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
background

340
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,200
you can hop in and you can read all of

341
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,639
this you'll see there's

342
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,240
recycle bin in there which

343
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,839
may be called trash 1000 if you're using

344
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,120
ubuntu uh but recycle bin

345
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
and trash are the two places where you

346
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,639
can look on a disk without

347
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,959
any other software to find your files

348
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,959
if it's been properly deleted you won't

349
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,079
find them

350
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,040
but in this case we have found a couple

351
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,440
things

352
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,279
hidden away in

353
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,680
our folder so when you get into recycle

354
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,519
bin you'll see that there's

355
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,800
a big string of text kind of just under

356
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
icon view in the top right

357
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,079
um recycle bin will have like an id

358
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,680
which you need to go in just an extra

359
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
subfolder to work with

360
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,440
and then you get all of these files

361
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,959
we've recovered

362
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,880
me talking about pandas

363
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,360
to the digital overdose stuff there's

364
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,800
plenty of other files there we can look

365
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,279
at

366
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,519
but that's not everything that is

367
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,959
missing on that disk we've done two

368
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,399
examples here

369
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,399
i've deleted some and i've shift deleted

370
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,079
some so let's go find all the rest

371
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
we're going to use autopsy it does a

372
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,320
little bit more than just opening a disk

373
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,040
and looking at hidden folders

374
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,800
we can use photorec to carver files

375
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,360
and there are a lot of other modules

376
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,639
that we can use

377
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,959
we're going to start with photorec and

378
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,680
just work with that on its own for now

379
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,399
so what photorec will do for us is it'll

380
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,160
read the disk for orphaned

381
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,720
or deleted files any other data

382
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,360
that hasn't been overwritten will be

383
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,560
looked over

384
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,040
for whether or not it matches the file

385
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,399
types we want

386
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,040
autopsy is free it's open source and it

387
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,000
runs on

388
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,920
linux mac windows it's designed to work

389
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,600
on windows that's where most of the

390
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
testing happens but it works

391
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,440
pretty flawlessly with kane

392
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,399
so we're going to speed run the setup

393
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,360
here

394
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
you can add in optional information if

395
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,040
you want we're not too concerned with

396
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,800
that we just want to get our files

397
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,399
so we're going to open a new case

398
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,160
we're going to give it a case name i'm

399
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,720
just giving it test data today

400
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,399
at the base directory you don't need to

401
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,560
change that's just where your project

402
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
folder will be so that's the path you're

403
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,240
going to need to type out later when we

404
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,000
get all our files and see where they've

405
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
been extracted to

406
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,279
and then we can jump down

407
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,279
press next hit finish and it'll bring

408
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,320
you to data sources

409
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,000
we want to add a local disk

410
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,880
because we physically plugged it in so

411
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,920
sdb

412
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,519
is a physical or a local disk here

413
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,880
because it's not a logical file it's not

414
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,279
an image file or any digital stuff

415
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
once you've selected your data source

416
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,759
it'll ask you to pick your disk

417
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,040
so we know it's sdb so you can choose

418
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,600
sdb or you can choose sdb1

419
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,360
which is the specific partition

420
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,480
on that disk that we're dealing with i'm

421
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,600
going to choose

422
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,639
sdb in this case because i want

423
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,759
everything even the unallocated space at

424
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,519
the end of the disc

425
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,120
and the extra little chunk

426
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,560
at the beginning which is where you're

427
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
going to find stuff like a bootloader

428
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
just in case there's anything in there

429
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,199
we're going to be thorough once you've

430
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,799
done that

431
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,679
you've got your ingest modules this is

432
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,640
where you pick

433
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,439
all of the fancy tools that autopsy has

434
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,199
available to it

435
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,839
we don't need anything particularly

436
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,799
fancy here

437
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,160
we don't need to look for encryption

438
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
we don't need to look for virtual

439
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
machines so we're going to deselect

440
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,679
all and to make this all go quicker

441
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,960
we're only going to select

442
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
photorec carver that's going to be our

443
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,200
file carver

444
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
it'll get the images that we're looking

445
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
for

446
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,360
now you can see at the bottom it's

447
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,120
analyzing the disk

448
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,080
it's taking a long time to work but

449
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
while it's doing that

450
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
we can actually expand this directory

451
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,520
tree and we can see what it's doing

452
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,720
in real time so as it finds a file it'll

453
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,600
throw it in

454
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,799
to the data source and we can work with

455
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,200
it straight away so

456
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
we're going to expand all those options

457
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,840
see what's available

458
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,080
and on the side there this is what it

459
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,640
looks like when it's fully expanded

460
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,799
so you'll see that there are a couple

461
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,320
folders with a v

462
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,559
there's a special folders that are

463
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,320
virtual they don't actually exist on the

464
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,360
disk

465
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
uh but they help us identify things so

466
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,960
that's where our carved files are going

467
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,840
to appear

468
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,640
in carved files if you had any orphan

469
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,799
files they would appear there as well

470
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,520
and then there's all of the unallocated

471
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
blocks

472
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,360
unallocated blocks won't have anything

473
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
particularly useful for us

474
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
it's just a way of if you need to

475
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,640
manually

476
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,080
access data that you think is there but

477
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,520
hasn't been found by your tools

478
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
other folders are all indexed on the

479
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,039
disk so you'll see

480
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,320
dollar extend dollar recycle bin those

481
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,520
exist

482
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,679
we can still access them treat it like a

483
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,799
normal file system

484
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,720
as if it's been mounted and accessed by

485
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,280
just a normal computer so you can still

486
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,640
go through the file system like that if

487
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,240
you want to

488
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,320
we have other things we can do like

489
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,720
showing results by file types

490
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,640
so if you wanted to filter down and you

491
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,400
only wanted to see

492
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,799
the videos you can click that and it'll

493
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,440
show

494
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,039
all the videos that it's found and

495
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,120
indexed from

496
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,080
everywhere so carved files in the

497
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,400
recycle bin if it's in both of those

498
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,679
those will both appear in images and

499
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,080
videos

500
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,919
then we have deleted files

501
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,200
deleted files at the bottom is

502
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,400
a special category that autopsy has

503
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
for defining anything that's in the

504
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
recycle bin

505
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,720
anything that's in trash and carved

506
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,840
files

507
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,440
it's like an aggregate of everything

508
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,760
that it classifies as

509
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,360
things you shouldn't have been able to

510
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,039
see

511
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,320
things you traditionally would have

512
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,799
tried to get rid of which is useful

513
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,520
if someone has deleted your panda

514
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,960
collection

515
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,080
and you wanted to go find it

516
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,320
if you head into deleted files you'll

517
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,679
see we've actually got

518
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,039
all of the names of the things that have

519
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,960
been deleted

520
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,200
with their extensions how big they are

521
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,960
and where they were

522
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,960
before they got deleted so in location

523
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,559
all of these images were put on the root

524
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,200
of our partition i just threw them

525
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,240
straight on the disk

526
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,760
and then they were deleted you can right

527
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,159
click

528
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,720
these and you can hit extract file

529
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,760
that'll send it to a project exports

530
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,799
folder

531
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,240
we'll visit the export folder in a

532
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,080
little bit we're going to look at some

533
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
other places where we can grab those

534
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,240
files

535
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,640
and what they look like these ones with

536
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,440
the little x

537
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,200
and the page those are ones that have

538
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,039
been recovered either from

539
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,159
the mft or

540
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,440
in our recycle bin

541
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,440
and we have carved files these have a

542
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,200
slightly different icon to them

543
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
as you can see and they also have a

544
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,959
naming convention

545
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,120
so you can right click and extract these

546
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,600
exactly the same as a deleted file

547
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,760
but one thing you have to bear in mind

548
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,799
is that this

549
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,320
method of carving files in autopsy it

550
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,000
doesn't seem to retain

551
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,360
the name so while most of the other data

552
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,600
is intact the actual image itself

553
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,400
perfectly fine you'll notice that you're

554
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,799
missing image names

555
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,559
so all we have to do after we've

556
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,640
exported all of our images

557
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,240
is head over to in this case

558
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,039
our root directory for our investigation

559
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,679
home

560
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,960
kane test data which is what we called

561
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,320
our project

562
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,240
and the export folder has all of the

563
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,360
images that we've recovered

564
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
so we can determine the end result of

565
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,320
our investigation which is

566
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,520
a lot of pandas we found all the missing

567
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,080
pandas

568
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,960
we did a mixture of file carving and

569
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
looking through for deleted files using

570
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,799
autopsy

571
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,280
now most of the pandas today have come

572
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,720
from zoos

573
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,200
all around the world and organizations

574
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,720
that help protect the red panda

575
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,760
population

576
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,039
worldwide uh i'll show you in the q a in

577
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,520
a minute

578
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
but you can give those organizations a

579
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,559
little bit of love

580
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,919
if you want to give them a little money

581
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,080
or just a quick shout out

582
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,080
with some links in the q a page

583
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,720
so tools we've used today we've used

584
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,640
kane as our operating system

585
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,120
we've used autopsy to do all our file

586
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,720
recovery tasks

587
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,480
if you have kane you don't need autopsy

588
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,000
it's built in

589
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,960
and my twitter link is just down there

590
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,559
and some accounts

591
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,600
where you can appreciate red pandas

592
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,360
all on the right i think

593
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,280
that is just about time so i think we

594
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,039
can start a q a now

595
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,919
see what everyone thinks

596
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,679
yes all the pandas

597
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,840
that was so fantastic i loved all the

598
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,760
pandas they were so cute my little heart

599
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
is so happy right now

600
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,240
i have a small competition running on my

601
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,400
twitter page if everyone wants to

602
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,039
get the first answer for how many pandas

603
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,919
there are

604
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,280
and how many unique pandas showed up

605
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,520
in the entire presentation i might be

606
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,159
handing out a little prize

607
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,480
okay alrighty so should i get the first

608
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:44,960
question

609
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,480
asked yes alright so

610
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,640
do you think autopsy is user-friendly

611
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,400
will beginners using autopsy have any

612
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,919
issues using you or do you think autopsy

613
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,360
is pretty self-explanatory

614
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,679
well documented i think autopsy is

615
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,000
very well documented at the very least

616
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,600
by the community

617
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
if you ever have a problem with how to

618
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,520
run a basic autopsy investigation

619
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,720
there are a lot of videos and

620
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,480
documents that are out there they'll

621
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,919
show you everything that you need to

622
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,400
know

623
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,200
but it should be fairly self-explanatory

624
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,279
going through the process it's like

625
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,919
a lot of click next and if you see

626
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,000
anything optional you can safely ignore

627
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,320
it

628
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,600
and it won't affect you in any way

629
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,039
alrighty good to know and then another

630
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:31,960
from

631
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,880
karem4567 hypothetically if autopsy does

632
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,440
not work

633
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,720
are there any other programs that are

634
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,279
just as good

635
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,320
autopsy should work in theory

636
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,080
um if autopsy doesn't then

637
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,760
i'm not sure you're going to have much

638
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
luck using other programs

639
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,760
i think there's something called

640
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,120
foremost

641
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,440
which is a command line tool which lets

642
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,039
you

643
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,080
scrape files for anything inside them

644
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,520
or allows you to scrape say sections of

645
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,440
the disk and see if there are any files

646
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,120
in there

647
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
but outside of that i don't think

648
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
there's many other tools that do

649
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,840
the same kind of functionality or better

650
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,159
alrighty awesome thank you so much

651
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,799
well thank you
