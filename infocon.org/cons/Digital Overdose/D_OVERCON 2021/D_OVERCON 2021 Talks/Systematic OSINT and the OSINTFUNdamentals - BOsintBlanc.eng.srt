1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,960
all right

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,080
hello everyone i am bosen blanc

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
uh i'm going to be talking to you today

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,839
about systematic ocean and ocean

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,720
um before i do that i need to talk a

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,080
little bit about

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,240
who the heck i am i have a background in

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,199
desktop support

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,279
i've worked in sock and incident

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,880
response or ir

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,519
i'm a lover of all things ocean i'm

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,120
currently employed as an intelligence

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,200
analyst with uh team lead with

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
the threat intelligence from dark power

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
uh you can see probably my little dark

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,920
tower hanging over

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,800
this shoulder i had a second place

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,320
finish with dwayne the sock

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,039
johnson that was my team in the trace

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,440
labs global search party

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,680
and i'm the case tracking and statistics

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,440
leads with ncpdf

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,520
which is national child protection task

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,960
force um

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,520
fantastic organizations both of them i'm

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
really lucky to be a part of them

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,680
uh that said uh nothing in this

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,640
presentation

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,080
that represents the views of my

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,760
employers or the organizations i'm

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
associated with past present or future

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
for better or worse this is all me uh so

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,119
you get what you get here uh thanks for

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,960
taking time to tune in

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
um i am going to be talking to you today

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
about seven fundamental skills

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
um ocean or open source intelligence

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,799
is an amazingly broad discipline um it

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,000
is a

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,759
big kind of unwieldy thing to learn

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,520
and it can feel quite overwhelming

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,159
honestly as you start to do that

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,320
um and what i've always found i've my

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,520
background and does some

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,680
support has led me to believe that all

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,920
things are easier when i break them down

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,720
into fundamental and adjustable parts

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:46,960
and

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,280
i really believe that we can teach that

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
you can teach and learn anything

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,200
all right so the seven the seven

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,960
fundamental skills that i came up with

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,079
as i thought about this

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,360
are curiosity diligence analytic and

55
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,880
intelligence technique

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,399
networking uh technique and tools ethics

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,600
and communication

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,598
um the first fundamental we're going to

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,800
talk about today is

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,239
curiosity ocean at its heart

61
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,200
is about uncovering answers uh to do it

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
you have to be interested

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,599
in learning things you're often going to

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,000
come

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
into contact with cultures uh

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,480
languages uh concepts that are very

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
familiar with you and you're gonna have

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,239
to

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
deep dive them and become uh at least

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
somewhat familiar if not sometimes an

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
expert in them

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
um so i say that to say

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,760
i really encourage people to chase

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
rabbit trails a lot of times when people

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,080
start to learn ocean i see them kind of

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,040
do this thing

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,280
where they're like oh i just you know i

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
got i went down this rabbit trail and it

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,160
didn't really pan out

80
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
so i guess that was a waste of time and

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
what i always tell people is

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,319
hey any time you spent learning is time

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,519
well spent

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
um it's not a waste to learn to learn

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,280
things and i think that

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
people who are interested in osun are

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,400
generally interested

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,360
in learning uh because you have to to be

89
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,400
good at it

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
um i uh i had a i had

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
an investigation that i conducted where

92
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
uh i noticed that the person

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
the person that i was investigating was

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,480
very interested in this style of

95
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
espresso making

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,239
um so i started to learn all about this

97
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,239
espresso making style

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,000
and i started to watch some youtube

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
videos about it because it was just kind

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,200
of interesting and i was like okay

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,760
and as i'm doing that i start to notice

102
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
hey that there's this person

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
who's consistently um going through

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,920
and commenting on all of the

105
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,280
all of the uh posts

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,599
and so as i started to do that i started

107
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,040
to connect that account

108
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
to this person i was investigating and i

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,720
was able to actually discover

110
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,680
um another another avenue of inquiry in

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
the investigation

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
through just being curious and being

113
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
interested in things

114
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
um so i really that's that's why i

115
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
always encourage people to go down

116
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000
rabbit trails

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,519
the next fundamental is diligence

118
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,358
um so when you've hit a wall

119
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,639
um it's often uh

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,280
bear with me just one moment my headset

121
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,840
is going real wacky

122
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,400
um so when you've hit the wall you and

123
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
you don't know where to take an

124
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,320
investment

125
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,400
investigation it's often important that

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,120
you don't give up

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,000
you have to you have to push through

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
when you don't know what to do

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,080
and this is what i always tell people is

130
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,759
to adapt and find

131
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,080
uh information what and think about what

132
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,199
information you do have find novel

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
pivot points um when you are

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,240
stuck you

135
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
you never know if the next thing that

136
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
you find will actually be the thing that

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,039
kind of breaks

138
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,800
wide open in investigation um

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,759
and so that's why it's just always

140
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,240
better

141
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
to take some time away from an

142
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,440
investigation if you're feeling

143
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,039
stuck and then to step forward

144
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,159
and uh continue to investigate that

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,639
the third fundamental is analytic and

146
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,639
intelligence technique

147
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,440
um analytic and intelligence technique

148
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,160
is what

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,120
separates good ocean from the worst kind

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,919
of ocean

151
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,000
analytic intelligence technique is

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,520
taking time

153
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,720
to use a process

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,160
to to actually analyze information

155
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,880
in an analytical way it often is trying

156
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,520
to turn

157
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,880
qualitative uh um qualitative data that

158
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,479
is data that doesn't involve

159
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,360
numbers into quantitative data into

160
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,199
something that we can measure

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,560
and sort so that said

162
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,880
i want to talk about before i get into

163
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
the nitty-gritty of

164
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
some some of the ways that you might do

165
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
analytic technique i want to talk about

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,319
the good the bad and the ocean

167
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,639
good ocean is there's a lot of our great

168
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,680
organizations

169
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,440
who are doing good ocean right now

170
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
organizations like bellingcat

171
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,720
trace labs ilf and ncpdf and honestly a

172
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,600
ton more who

173
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
uh it would take more time than i have

174
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,520
to talk about

175
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,880
um and there's also bad ocean that uh er

176
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,600
that is ocean being done right now uh or

177
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,120
in recent memory uh

178
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
rhett we can see that with reddit and

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
the boston bomber and

180
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,160
multiple people falsely accused during

181
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
the u.s capital rights both kind of

182
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,759
both of those situations kind of have

183
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,199
the same problem

184
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,319
um people took very loose information

185
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,599
and just kind of went

186
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
wild and just made an accusation like

187
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,680
based on almost no information

188
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,319
so we want to try to be like the good

189
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,160
ocean who use the techniques that we're

190
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,199
going to talk about uh

191
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,319
analytic and analytic and techniques and

192
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,560
try to avoid their biases

193
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,599
um technique really

194
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,039
is key so i want for your for the next

195
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,160
investor and this could

196
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,639
be actually any investigation but i'm

197
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,199
obviously specifically focusing on ocean

198
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,440
i want you to try a simple method to add

199
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,160
a deeper analysis to a hypothesis or a

200
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,479
conclusion you've drawn

201
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,680
um so how what you can do and uh

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,080
shout out to i think i saw this from

203
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,199
katie nichols

204
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,840
who's a threat intelligence uh person

205
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,039
with red canary

206
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,360
but she she she kind of talked about you

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,319
can conclude with

208
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,440
uh uh you can make a conclusion with

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,840
high

210
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,039
medium or low certainty uh and you have

211
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,160
you can decide

212
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,639
you're trying to evaluate your

213
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,599
hypothesis

214
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,840
so what i what i added because again

215
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,960
we're trying to make

216
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,440
qualitative quantitative right um so

217
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,800
we're going to set what we

218
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
what i added to this was i'm going to

219
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,879
set a threshold for each certainty level

220
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,160
i might use so for example if i have a

221
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,440
high certainty

222
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,160
i could use five points of verification

223
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,879
a point of

224
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,800
i would consider a point of verification

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,080
something like

226
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,280
hey i have fundamentally correlated this

227
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,240
username

228
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,520
to this person um and that one point of

229
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,319
one point of verification could be that

230
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:30,639
i

231
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,559
i have uh you know they live in the

232
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,719
right region uh a second point of

233
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,559
correlation could be they have the right

234
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,240
first and last name

235
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,440
um you know so uh points of verification

236
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,080
are just

237
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,440
points of certainty uh it's uh

238
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
again we're taking qualitative things

239
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
and making quantitative so

240
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
uh you have to work shop it a little bit

241
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
and figure out what works

242
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
um in terms of evidence but so i could

243
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,320
choose

244
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
five points of verification with zero

245
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,760
pieces of evidence against my conclusion

246
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,680
for a medium certainty i might do five

247
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
points of verification with

248
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,839
some evidence against my conclusion or i

249
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,519
could do three points of verification

250
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,000
with

251
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,120
zero evidence and for a low certainty i

252
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,680
would have

253
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
either a small amount of supporting

254
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,000
evidence or a medium amount of evidence

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
against my conclusion

256
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,920
i i will say there is actually a fourth

257
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,560
option

258
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,959
uh which is zero certainty and that

259
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,240
actually does need to be kind of

260
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,959
discussed

261
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,279
you would not put that on a conclusion

262
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,480
probably because if you have zero

263
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,279
certainty

264
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
you just need to go back to the drawing

265
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
board but um i will say that

266
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,640
there are some times where you have zero

267
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
certainty and if you have zero certainty

268
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,120
that means

269
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,880
probably keep investigating um

270
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,080
i wanna talk about biases uh biases are

271
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
and honestly uh this is a primer to

272
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,519
biases

273
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,640
there are a ton of biases um biases

274
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,959
are basically things that affect our

275
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,560
decision making it's a narrow

276
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,320
it's a narrow way of thinking about

277
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
people situations

278
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,519
decisions um and often they're caused by

279
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,680
our brains which like to make things

280
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,880
easy uh

281
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,600
and often situations are more complex

282
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
than we really like them to be

283
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,000
um so i'm gonna give you some examples

284
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,920
of biases and maybe an example what that

285
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
bias might look like

286
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,839
so hopefully that you can think about

287
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,600
and if you've never done this i highly

288
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,399
encourage you

289
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
to start examining your biases they

290
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,839
really will

291
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,399
impact you as an investigator and i mean

292
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,760
i think fundamentally as a person i

293
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,440
think it's all healthy for us

294
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,839
as human beings to examine what biases

295
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,440
we might have and how those

296
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
are affecting our relationships and um

297
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,120
interactions

298
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,839
um so uh the first bias i want to talk

299
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,160
about is the dunning-kruger effect

300
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
the dunning-kruger effect is that people

301
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,760
perceive a concept or event to be

302
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,839
simplistic because they lack knowledge

303
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,480
on that

304
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,240
so you for example you might say

305
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,200
geolocation uh which is trying to place

306
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,560
uh a place in the world from a picture

307
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,920
uh or an image of some kind

308
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,839
it's pretty easy right you just reverse

309
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,040
image stuff

310
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,680
and anybody who's done geolocation knows

311
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,920
wow there's a lot more to it than that

312
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,839
there's a lot of verification that has

313
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,000
to happen there's a lot of research

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,560
that has to happen but it because you

315
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,079
don't understand the process

316
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,440
it might seem easy um and we can do that

317
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
a lot with

318
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,760
especially in a professional setting uh

319
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,000
maybe concepts that we don't know or you

320
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,839
know our co-workers are doing something

321
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,480
and we're like

322
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
oh that's just what they do is really

323
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,160
easy marketing is really easy

324
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,959
uh and i mean you know you know we know

325
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,120
nothing about it so it's good to examine

326
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,160
how that might be affecting us uh

327
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,920
second bias i want to talk to you about

328
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
is availability bias

329
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
sometimes called the availability

330
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,040
heuristic this is the tendency to use

331
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
information we can recall quickly

332
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,399
when evaluating a topic so for example

333
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,839
you read a news story about people

334
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,440
who've won the lottery

335
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
and as time passes on you begin to buy

336
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,200
more and more lottery tickets

337
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,760
overestimating your chances of winning

338
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,560
uh despite the fact that there's a

339
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,639
really large statistical probability

340
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,320
that you're not gonna win

341
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,440
and i i mean this one is real because we

342
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,320
see this happening

343
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,839
all the time right people buy lottery

344
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,440
tickets every single day

345
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,399
and most of them do it on the thought

346
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,040
that

347
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,519
i you know i might win i could win even

348
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,399
though it's like

349
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
far more likely that you'll be struck by

350
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,000
lightning than you will be

351
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,240
then you will win the lottery there's

352
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
very little chance that this is gonna

353
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,399
happen

354
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,399
but people do it all the time so by this

355
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,240
bias is really in play

356
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
a lot the last bias is fundamental

357
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,120
attribution error

358
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,880
this is the tendency to attribute

359
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,720
someone's behavior to existing and

360
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,360
unbounded stereotypes while attributing

361
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,160
our own behavior to external factors

362
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
so this is like for example you get cut

363
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,920
off on the highway and you yell what a

364
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,000
maniac that's the pc version

365
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,040
um and uh attributing the action

366
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,360
to poor character on the person who cut

367
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,240
shoes off part

368
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,680
when it's possible they have a very good

369
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,760
reason to be in a hurry and then

370
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,440
you know maybe you're in a hurry and you

371
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,880
cut somebody off

372
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,200
and you just think well i had plenty i

373
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
had things to do i had somewhere to be

374
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
it's i i mean it's okay that i cut them

375
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,680
off

376
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,800
um we often don't know people's stories

377
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,560
uh that's what i'll say on this one we

378
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,079
don't know what's going on in people's

379
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,720
lives

380
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
um and i think it's really healthy to

381
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,160
take a step back

382
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,240
and really try to figure out i mean

383
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
especially you know i use

384
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,959
as a in a leadership position

385
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,399
i always try to take a step back if

386
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,839
somebody is doing something i don't

387
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,040
understand

388
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,199
and try to understand and try to get

389
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,720
with them and ask them hey what's going

390
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,399
on where what were you thinking when

391
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,040
you did that thing uh because people

392
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,320
will surprise you

393
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,279
um so and in making an investigative

394
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,480
decisions

395
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,000
uh this can cause us to misunderstand

396
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,480
people's behavior and why they might be

397
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,199
doing something

398
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,240
the fourth fundamental is community and

399
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,279
networking

400
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,399
um i will say that uh for infosec at

401
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,040
large

402
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,560
and not just ocean i think that

403
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,639
networking is a requirement it's not

404
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,240
just a good idea

405
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,399
um that may be really scary to some of

406
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,920
you and that's okay

407
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,880
uh i'm by nature uh a people person i

408
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
really like connecting to people

409
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,560
and it's okay if that doesn't feel good

410
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
to you i will say we all have to

411
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
challenge ourselves to do it

412
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,120
um and not just for uh professional

413
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
opportunities is what i'll say

414
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
um i had a situation uh during an

415
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,199
investigation

416
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,600
um where we were i was looking at this

417
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
person whose name

418
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
uh first name was chayo and i was

419
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,160
talking and

420
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,920
this couldn't really find anything about

421
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,199
them i had a friend

422
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,639
who uh you know obviously uh grew up uh

423
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,519
not in america

424
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,880
and they said hey did you know that

425
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,560
chaio uh is

426
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,160
uh short for rosario that's a nickname

427
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
and i was like oh no i didn't know that

428
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,040
um and that saved me possibly hours of

429
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,160
investigative work

430
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,839
but also maybe something i would have

431
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,600
never figured out because

432
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,519
i just didn't have a cultural context

433
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,320
for that and their cultural context

434
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,199
was like brought so much insight into

435
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,480
that situation

436
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,880
and that's what i'll say for you as you

437
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
do investigations

438
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,360
networking will bring down avenues

439
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,480
of insight and avenues of go

440
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,160
of investigation that you would have

441
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,399
never thought of diversity

442
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,759
brings insight into uh decision making

443
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,759
and investigations

444
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,560
um and i'll say we need you need

445
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
diversity to solve complex problems you

446
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,000
need diversity of experience

447
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,240
expertise knowledge and culture and

448
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,839
networking isn't just about

449
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,600
getting a new job it's about like i said

450
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,920
finding those holes in your knowledge

451
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
where i've been most successful has been

452
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
joining a volunteer cause that's i'm

453
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,279
very passionate about

454
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,519
um with ncptf uh and by being active and

455
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,519
engaging the ocean and impossec

456
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,320
twitter communities um i've made i say

457
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,040
this i've

458
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,639
not only learned things i've not only

459
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,120
been able to i think advanced my career

460
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,320
through things that i've learned

461
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
but i've been able to make really good

462
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
friends um people who i consider close

463
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,399
friends and who have

464
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,440
bettered me as a human um so i think

465
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,600
it's really really important

466
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,000
um the fifth fundamental is tools and

467
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,040
techniques

468
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,839
um my teammate from uh dwayne stuck

469
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,040
johnson jake kreps

470
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,279
he says remember ocean doesn't equal

471
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,079
tools

472
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,079
uh tools help you plan and collect data

473
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,839
but the end of the result of the tool

474
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,000
is not ocean you have to analyze receive

475
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,279
feedback refine

476
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,360
produce a final actionable product of

477
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,880
value before you can call it

478
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,399
intelligence

479
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,519
uh i think that or that is very wise

480
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,320
words

481
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,120
getting used uh we use a lot of tools in

482
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,759
ocean

483
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,240
um they make our jobs easier uh they

484
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,600
make it quicker

485
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,440
uh but being overly reliant on a tool is

486
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,959
actually a problem

487
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,640
you have to and i would say you should

488
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,559
know how to do all the things that a

489
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,679
tool does for you

490
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,679
manually or when that tool breaks and it

491
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,919
inevitably will

492
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,760
you will not know what to do and you're

493
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,079
going to be kind of in a pickle

494
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,919
so i i do think that ocean tools come

495
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
often and they often come as quickly as

496
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,679
they go and so because of that

497
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,240
one one key to mastering ocean is

498
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
learning how to master a tool quickly

499
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,120
there are three questions that i ask

500
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,000
when i

501
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
uh learning when i'm learning a tool i

502
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
ask what's the goal

503
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,880
uh i.e what does the tool do

504
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,120
what's the method how does it do what it

505
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,000
does

506
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,160
and then do i need an expert to learn

507
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
from

508
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,039
this is i mean this is really true even

509
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,720
for something as simple as

510
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,480
google advanced search operators or

511
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,160
google dorks um

512
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,480
you need to understand how google

513
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,240
indexes content

514
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,480
you need to understand why why it pulls

515
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
what it pulls and you need to understand

516
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,120
that there's actually

517
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,320
and you may or may not know this is

518
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,559
actually an algorithm who's putting

519
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,120
information to the top trying to guess

520
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,320
what you want

521
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,880
and sometimes when you're doing dorks

522
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,720
you're actually fighting the algorithm

523
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,559
to get the content that it doesn't think

524
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,360
you want

525
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,440
so understanding that will help you

526
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
structure searches better

527
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,799
so that's just an example there's a lot

528
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,160
of ins and outs to tools um the

529
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,000
sixth fundamental is ethics and

530
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
verification

531
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,200
i put one bullet point here very large

532
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,440
don't do crimes don't do illegal things

533
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,000
uh all of this stuff and i mean i would

534
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,799
i would say

535
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,840
don't do ocean for good um that is

536
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,440
my passion is that hey these tools

537
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,520
uh that we have all of this information

538
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,960
that we have i want to use it for

539
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,080
positive

540
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
uh things that are putting good stuff

541
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,799
into the world um

542
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,760
that said don't do illegal things um we

543
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,200
can break ethics down

544
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,320
into slightly bigger appoints

545
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
um there's three questions that i ask

546
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,520
with ethics

547
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,240
is it legal i.e does it follow all

548
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,039
national

549
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,240
state and local ordinances that's the

550
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,280
legal aspect

551
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,720
am i doing a crime by doing this um

552
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,360
is it approved i.e does it follow my

553
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
organizational policies and code of

554
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
conduct

555
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,600
i consider uh i when i sign up to do a

556
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
job i've agreed to do the things that

557
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
they're asking me to do

558
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,400
it means i'm going to follow the

559
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,200
policies and if they have a code of

560
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,039
conduct or if they have a methodology

561
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,720
they want to use that is differing from

562
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,960
my own i'm the one who needs to change

563
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,720
not them unless and there's always

564
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
conversations that can be had about

565
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,039
policy

566
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,160
you know is it moral is the last

567
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,880
question

568
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
i.e does it follow my personal internal

569
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,039
compass or values of what is right and

570
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,240
wrong

571
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,320
we have to wrestle with our personal

572
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,240
morality and our personal

573
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,280
value system in the context of doing

574
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,320
this work

575
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,720
a really good example of all of this is

576
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,919
just the idea

577
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,559
at large of amongst the internet the

578
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,600
idea of

579
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,200
doxing is pretty negative however

580
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,120
most of what we do in ocean would be

581
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,960
considered doxing right we're

582
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
doxing people or figuring out the

583
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
internal details of their life

584
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,000
but really the context is different

585
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,520
if i am chasing somebody who is trapping

586
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,120
trafficking csam that's child sexual

587
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,559
material i feel what i don't have any

588
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,600
moral problem with

589
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
doxing that person because they have

590
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,840
broken moral code in my opinion and are

591
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,600
doing something that's very heinous

592
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,320
so i think that that changes the

593
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
equation

594
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
of the context of what i'm doing

595
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,080
in terms of what the person i'm

596
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,840
investigating is doing

597
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
you may disagree with that and that's

598
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
okay um

599
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,799
if you do it's just something to think

600
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,480
about and you have to think about

601
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,559
ultimately do i have organizational

602
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,880
alignment with the organizations i'm in

603
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,559
with my value system and if

604
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,559
if you don't that actually is a i think

605
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,080
that that's a pretty major problem you

606
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,000
need to have organizational alignment

607
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,919
with your morality

608
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,159
my opinion fundamental 7 communication

609
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,679
information not conveyed in a

610
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,679
comprehensible way is meaningless

611
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,520
if i give you a presentation and you

612
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,120
don't understand anything

613
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,039
what i'm talking about i failed as a

614
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,520
presenter

615
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,240
how i communicate does depend on my

616
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
audience um for example if i'm talking

617
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,919
to a c-suite i'm going to talk about

618
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,960
things like uh

619
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
that's a corporate suite like so that's

620
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,200
like executives uh i come from corporate

621
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,840
world so

622
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,440
that's valuable to me uh if i talk to a

623
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,520
c-suite i'll talk about cost

624
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
uh return on investment i'll give a

625
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,559
high-level

626
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,480
overview they do not want the technical

627
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,559
details most of the time

628
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,720
um if i'm talking to my marketing team

629
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,840
i'm going to talk about brand and

630
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,200
reputation

631
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,240
those are the things that's their

632
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,679
language that may that's what makes

633
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,880
sense to them if i'm talking to a

634
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,159
technical team i'm gonna talk about

635
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:02,960
scope

636
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
evidence technical details they don't

637
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,240
want they don't want

638
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,320
i can go really i can nerd out with them

639
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,400
right i can talk about those things

640
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,360
uh and so you have to match what you're

641
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,280
saying to the situation

642
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,400
um and that is a a lot of times where we

643
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,080
get into problems

644
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,320
uh where somebody isn't understanding us

645
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,760
it's often because we have

646
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,799
chosen the wrong format to convey what

647
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,159
we're conveying

648
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,640
um i want to put it all together now

649
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,720
so this is an actual investigation that

650
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,679
i did

651
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,760
um i've obviously removed a lot of the

652
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,240
details as to not docs anymore

653
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,280
um so uh with at the beginning of the

654
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,120
at the beginning of the investigation

655
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,960
and you'll see that in the blue cloud

656
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,440
my goal identified the controller of an

657
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,640
anonymous account

658
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,159
so that's the beginning of our

659
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,240
investigation and that's my ethics piece

660
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,080
is that an ethical decision is that an

661
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
ethical thing to do

662
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,120
i used uh curiosity i discovered the

663
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,000
city state

664
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,799
first name i discovered their likely

665
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,080
occupation

666
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,000
and then i hit diligence because i just

667
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,080
stalled out for a while there i had that

668
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,000
for a while and i was like i know their

669
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,600
first name and city they live in but

670
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,400
there's a million

671
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,760
i'm gonna call them karen there's a

672
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,520
million karen's in the city

673
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,000
uh how where you know where where do i

674
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,400
go where do i go from here uh i

675
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,799
continued to investigate their accounts

676
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,120
and i found that they posted a picture

677
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,080
of their wi-fi

678
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,280
network uh that actually came

679
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
that actually was amazing uh they were

680
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,720
kind of like it was sort of like a hey

681
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,559
haha look at my wi-fi network name and i

682
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,000
was like amazing thank you for doing

683
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,280
that because

684
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,480
uh i had done uh sector o35's uh

685
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,840
ocean quiz uh and in his ocean quiz he

686
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,120
talks about a great website called

687
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,080
weigle.net

688
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
weigel.net is a war driving website

689
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,840
where people

690
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,760
actually have collected a bunch of data

691
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,679
of wi-fi network names and where they

692
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,720
are in the world

693
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,679
so i was able to take that wi-fi network

694
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,080
name

695
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,400
place it on a specific street in that

696
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,279
city

697
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,320
uh with that uh i took a little bit of

698
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,240
an intuitive leap i used the tool i used

699
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
google maps to find the nearest location

700
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
of where someone of their occupation was

701
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,600
likely to work at

702
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,440
um and then i went back to curiosity

703
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,919
piece i started investigating that that

704
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,760
website of this organization

705
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,440
and i found a best staff list with a

706
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,679
biography that matched their first name

707
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,200
and all the other identifying

708
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
information amazing right like i got

709
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,360
this is this is it i was like this is

710
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
the this is the piece however

711
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,120
i use my analytic and intelligence

712
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
technique i'm pretty sure this is it

713
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,200
right

714
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,440
my heart's like yes let's go but i

715
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,240
confirmed

716
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,080
that all the information that i found

717
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,480
had matched that there was no points

718
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,200
of uh there was no evidence against it i

719
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,520
communicated my evidence to my team

720
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,000
and my team reviewed and analyzed the

721
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,760
evidence and they confirmed my working

722
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,640
theory

723
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,840
we we used we used a process to actually

724
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,640
make sure

725
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,200
this is the right person at the end of

726
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
it i got to communicate that information

727
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,559
i generated a report and after a short

728
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,799
time i solicited feedback on that report

729
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,000
to make sure

730
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,919
hey did you get what you wanted out of

731
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,840
this was this what you were hoping to

732
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,279
find out

733
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,559
and with that that ended the

734
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,559
investigation um

735
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,120
so i'll say with all this we can see

736
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,760
that

737
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,320
how each of these pieces touches uh

738
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,840
touches the investigation

739
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,039
i am running short on time um so uh

740
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,760
thank you so much for listening to me i

748
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,000

750
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,360
um thank you for your time wow that was

751
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,840
that was awesome loving your energy uh

752
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,320
managed to

753
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,360
do a lot of stuff so um we have two

754
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,640
questions one is from me

755
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,159
uh it's a it's a little bit of a joke

756
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,320
question but uh you understand why

757
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,799
uh so i'm speaking of attribution errors

758
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,360
yeah

759
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,640
so i'm going from the stereotype um well

760
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,400
not the stereotype the the the fact that

761
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,000
i know that you are good at ocean

762
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
you do a lot of awesome stuff i mean it

763
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,600
is in your handle right

764
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,559
um how many monitors do you have i have

765
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,600
three monitors

766
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,679
i gotta have i mean that's

767
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,360
i think that that's a necessity to be

768
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,679
honest i've told when i have to work off

769
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,360
just my laptop screen i'm like how i

770
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,640
literally don't know how to do it i

771
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,320
don't know how i work off just a laptop

772
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,639
screen

773
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,640
i have five screens here so as i

774
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,679
understand it entirely um

775
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,080
yeah and uh second question what's your

776
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,520
favorite part about ocean

777
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,000
oh can you repeat that question yep

778
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,840
what's your favorite part about ocean

779
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,559
oh it might not work

780
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,720
uh can i hear can i hear

781
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,279
more technical difficulties i think i'm

782
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,960
having trip i'm not having audio issues

783
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,200
i apologize

784
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,559
everything was working and then it just

785
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,879
stopped

786
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,440
um right well i think we've hit

787
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,559
time um so

788
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,320
unless this kind of gets resolved if you

789
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,600
want to just i can

790
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,640
as long as you can hear me if you want

791
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,840
to type it in the chat i can always

792
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,720
answer

793
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,440
from the chat how do you know when it

794
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
when it's time to stop a line of

795
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,000
investigation

796
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,640
um i think for me when it's time to stop

797
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,159
a line of investigation

798
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,000
um is when

799
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,120
i i usually set a hard limit um honestly

800
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,720
i sat like i'll return to an

801
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,600
investigation

802
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,240
about usually about three times with

803
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,600
some time between it

804
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,200
so if i have returned on the third time

805
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
and i'm still really not finding

806
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,399
anything

807
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,960
i'll usually hit hit up hit up somebody

808
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,240
else have them

809
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
look over what i what i've what i've

810
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,720
discovered and see do you see any other

811
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,279
ways

812
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,919
of going about this investigation and if

813
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:24,399
we're st

814
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,159
if we come to the conclusion together

815
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,919
that there's really nothing to do

816
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,840
that's kind of when i stop

817
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,960
awesome um let's see

818
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,880
if you pick up on the last question my

819
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,320
favorite part of ocean

820
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,600
um i love the puzzle of it you know

821
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
that's what i love

822
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,840
i love piecing together like i mean in

823
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,279
the investigation that i shared

824
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,640
when i made the jump from wi-fi network

825
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,279
to street to hey i think that they might

826
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,159
work here

827
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,000
i just like i literally will like a lot

828
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,679
of times i'll be like yes i'll actually

829
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,159
like cheer out loud i'll be like got him

830
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,159
i love that for because it's like

831
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,399
there's something about it that is so

832
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,320
satisfying to me that piece of like

833
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,840
making the connection

834
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,320
of all this kind of seemingly confusing

835
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,080
or maybe seems like to separate

836
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,880
information

837
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,000
to an answer i love that

838
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,880
awesome um yeah thank you so much that

839
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,320
was fantastic

840
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
you had beautiful energy throughout the

841
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,679
entire talk
