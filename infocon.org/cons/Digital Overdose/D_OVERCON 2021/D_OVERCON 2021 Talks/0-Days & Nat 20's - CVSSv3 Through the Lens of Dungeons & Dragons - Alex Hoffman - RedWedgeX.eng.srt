that's near and dear to my heart

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,160
something that i know everybody loves uh

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,760
makes pen testers red teamers

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
sit at the edge of their seat and jump

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,960
for joy it is the

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,640
common vulnerability scoring system

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,840
i don't know your real-time feedback so

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,279
i assume everybody is jumping up and

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,279
down and and super excited

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,039
and cheering and applauding because this

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,640
is such a super exciting topic right

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,559
no okay right i get it we'll try and

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,239

i'm going to go ahead and throw out the

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,760
obligatory presentation and opinions are

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,440
my own and have not been approved or

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
invented or vetted by my oppo

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,400
excuse me not been approved or vetted by

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,439
my employer

34
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,360
all right so let's get into the common

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,840
vulnerability scoring system

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,439
common vulnerability scoring system is a

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,360
free and open industry standard

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,960
that's designed to measure the severity

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,320
of a vulnerability and take into account

40
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,200
risk

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
it's currently on version 3.1 but it was

42
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,240
originally released in 2005

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,159
it's a tool that's useful for security

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,759
professionals uh

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,079
infosec people pen testers red teamers

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,040
blue teamers

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
even sysadmins network administrators

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,119
i'm going to teach you why today

49
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,720
because it really is a great tool and

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,320
it's more than you probably

51
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,040
realize when you think about cvss as a

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,880
pen tester i use cvss

53
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,560
to provide accurate measurable findings

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
to my customers

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,320
as a defender use it to understand risk

56
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,079
as it applies to your environment

57
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,799
triage important findings as a system

58
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,719
administrator network administrator

59
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,640
uh you can use to prioritize patching or

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,880
understand ways to reduce residual risk

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,320
uh using the temporal and environmental

62
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,399
scoring that we'll talk about later

63
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,240
uh through the talk i'll be using the

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
screenshots from the calculator the cbss

65
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,598
calculator on first.org

66
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,959
i'll throw a link up at the end but feel

67
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,920
free to just google if you want to

68
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,959
follow along

69
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,480
cbss 3.1 calculator so when you think of

70
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
cvss i'm sure everybody in the room

71
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,280
thinks about

72
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480
these things these are called

73
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
qualitative severity rankings and that's

74
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,879
the low

75
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,599
medium high critical findings you've

76
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,879
probably seen these on the top of every

77
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,160
pen test report

78
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,239
or security center findings and exposed

79
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,560
findings along with the cvss score of

80
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
zero to ten

81
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
what's important to know is there's more

82
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,280
to it than just that

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
the qualitative severity rankings are

84
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,959
great because they look awesome on the

85
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,640
top of an executive summary

86
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,879
they brief well in slides to leadership

87
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
but there's more to cvss than just the

88
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,440
number

89
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
and just taking into account the number

90
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
if i tell you something's at 9.6

91
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,200
critical

92
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
that sounds bad but it doesn't really

93
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,959
give you an understanding of why it

94
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,720
sounds bad

95
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,159
so the most important part about cvss

96
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,640
is the cds vector string so the vector

97
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,239
string looks like this

98
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,200
and this is a line that tells you

99
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,560
everything you need to know about that

100
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,599
vulnerability

101
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
why it's bad for you and how can it

102
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
affect you more so than just that

103
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,360
9.8 number um

104
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
like i said it's a text representation

105
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
of the severity of the metrics

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,920
it's commonly used to record or transfer

107
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,480
cvss metrics in a concise form

108
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
what's cool about this is you can

109
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,840
actually paste copy that entire string

110
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,799
as it is

111
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,360
uh go to the cvss calculator put a pound

112
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,519
sign at the end of the url paste that in

113
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
press enter and now you've got the

114
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
calculator loaded with those findings

115
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
so it's a standardized way of looking at

116
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,599
it so i was thinking about i

117
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,519
was playing dungeons dragons at work

118
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,280
last year during lunch

119
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,720
and i finished playing and went back to

120
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,680
my office and started

121
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
writing a pen test report and it dawned

122
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
on me that this

123
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,000
is so similar to a dnd stats block you

124
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
know if i take that same format and put

125
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
something like that up on the screen

126
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
if you're a d d player you know what

127
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,239
that means right you got dungeons

128
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,439
dragons fifth edition

129
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,959
your character strength dexterity

130
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,120
constitution intelligence wisdom and

131
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,560
charisma

132
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,720
that's a stats block that's how you play

133
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
the game and it dawned on me that cvss

134
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,080
is so similar

135
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,238
to that so what i want to do now is i

136
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,358
want to take everybody

137
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,279
through a uh let's just say a dmd

138
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
adventure but using cvss as our

139
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,840
character sheet

140
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,280
how does that sound all right cool

141
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
so let's introduce our character his

142
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,199
name is confluentis he is a dwarf

143
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,000
bard historian and capable fighter who

144
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,919
travels the realm adventuring

145
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,320
and thirsting for knowledge combat and a

146
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
good cup of java

147
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,919
so i'm gonna go ahead and take off my

148
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,680
infosec presenter hat and put on my

149
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,759
dungeon master hat and introduce

150
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,199
our story so far

151
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,000
our hero confluentis has wandered the

152
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,560
land of internetia for 15 years

153
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,720
he has traversed the sub oceanic light

154
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
ways the series of elven tubes

155
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,360
and has ventured beyond the stars and

156
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,680
back he has collected vast

157
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,320
libraries of knowledge and the monks of

158
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,840
the devops monastery

159
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
in the land of jira have taken him as

160
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,000
their foretold champion

161
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,639
but today he faces his greatest threat

162
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,600
yet

163
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,680
he ventures far from home to a place

164
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,840
feared by professionals

165
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,880
today he encounters the tomb

166
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
of zero day

167
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,479
confluentist triumphantly storms from

168
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,759
room to room

169
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,639
destroying all that stand in his way he

170
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,840
stands tall

171
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,280
uninjured and undamaged he feels it

172
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,080
he know he must be close the prize will

173
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,199
be his

174
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,759
the cloak of invulnerability must be

175
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,520
through this last door

176
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,000
he bursts in and finds himself face to

177
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,360
face with our villain cryptokid666

178
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
who is this we don't know could be a

179
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,440
chaotic neutral kid just trying to see

180
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,479
what he can see

181
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,039
could be a lawful evil state lawful evil

182
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:03,919
state actor

183
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,520
or a corporate entity with nefarious

184
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
intentions trying to bring glory to her

185
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,919
homeland

186
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,400
or raise stock prices who knows

187
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,039
cryptokid666 quickly thumbs through a

188
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,080
spell book

189
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,120
a wry smile creeping across thin lips

190
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,400
in a long dead language the words flow

191
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,319
casting the ancient spell of cve

192
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,280
2019-3396

193
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,240
confluence server before 6.6.12 i

194
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,639
achieve

195
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,560
path traversal via server-side template

196
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
injection weakness in your widget

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,800
connector component

198
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,120
confluences feels weak and falls to his

199
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,080
knees

200
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,520
cryptokid rolls for damage

201
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,120
all right so stepping back a bit let's

202
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,199
talk about the attack roll this is the

203
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
base score section of the calculator

204
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,479
uh these scores are typically set by uh

205
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,160
whoever's publishing the cve

206
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
whether that's the producer of the

207
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,240
software that the vulnerability is found

208
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,880
in

209
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,199
or the uh you know the finder whoever

210
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,199
produced the cd so the base score

211
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:05,680
doesn't

212
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
change that's the important thing to

213
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,199
know about base metrics

214
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,360
the base score takes the entire

215
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,720
vulnerability in a vacuum

216
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,319
doesn't take into account your specific

217
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,479
use case network protections at your

218
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,520
corporate level

219
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,639
uh anything else other than in a

220
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,720
base level this is what the score is so

221
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,000
these like i said these are typically

222
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,639
set

223
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,599
uh beforehand

224
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,800
so let's talk about some of these

225
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
specifically i'm not going to read the

226
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,840
entire slide because nobody likes that

227
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,960
but i'm going to use it you know

228
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,800
to talk about a little bit the attack

229
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,280
vector is how the attacker will get to

230
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,680
the

231
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,160
vulnerability uh anywhere from physical

232
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,520
which is someone has to physically be

233
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
touching the machine

234
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,360
an attacker has to be on the box up to

235
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,879
network which is like a wide area

236
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,879
network up to and including the internet

237
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,000
so if it's successful on the internet

238
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,160
it's a network level attack

239
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,000
then there's adjacent network and local

240
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,599
networks which which break that down

241
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,720
further

242
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,240
attack complexity these are things

243
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,680
beyond the attacker's control that have

244
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,879
to exist

245
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,120
so for example a man in the middle is

246
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,960
considered a high complexity attack

247
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,879
because it requires a lot of other steps

248
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,240
to be able to do

249
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,160
additionally another great example is

250
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,919
when a component in the software has to

251
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,520
be configured a certain way

252
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
or running a certain plug-in for the

253
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
attack to be valued perfect attack to

254
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,840
work

255
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,520
that's considered high complexity

256
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,879
because the attacker can't control

257
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,759
whether or not that plug-in is enabled

258
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,919
privilege is required this is what level

259
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,599
the attacker has to have before getting

260
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,639
into the box

261
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,639
so when we talk about no privileges

262
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,479
required this is your true remote code

263
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,839
execution on a website

264
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,120
you don't need to be logged in you don't

265
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,559
need to be authenticated anything like

266
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,760
that

267
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
low is you have to have basically a user

268
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
shell or you have to have user access

269
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,279
so things like local privilege

270
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
escalation are typically low privilege

271
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,080
required

272
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,160
high players excuse me high privilege

273
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,519
required uh

274
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,040
typically things like administrator root

275
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,279
credentials are required before you can

276
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,399
exploit this vulnerability

277
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,240
user interaction the requirement that a

278
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,440
user does something

279
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,120
other than the attacker so if there is

280
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,200
something that needs to be clicked on

281
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,320
or opened or run by a user who is not

282
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,279
the attacker

283
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,640
that's a user interaction required

284
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,800
otherwise it's none

285
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,959
scope is one of the more convoluted ones

286
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,640
the hardest harder ones to understand in

287
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
these metrics

288
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,560
the scope is weather is changed or

289
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,920
unchanged based on

290
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
if one component impacts resources in a

291
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,760
different component beyond its security

292
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
scope

293
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
so when you think of scope change in pen

294
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,920
test world

295
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
you typically think well i attacked this

296
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,399
box i have a shell on this box and this

297
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,080
box now gives me access to another

298
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
network

299
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,720
that's a scope change not really in cvss

300
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,440
world

301
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,880
scope change you have to take into

302
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,040
account the single security authority

303
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,320
so you think about an active directory

304
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
domain if you open an active directory

305
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,200
controller

306
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
you own that entire security authority

307
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,360
but if you use those credits to pawn

308
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
every box in that network it's not a

309
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,480
change in scope

310
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
because you have not changed security

311
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,519
scopes

312
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,080
a good example of this working when it

313
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,200
would be changed

314
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,720
is something like a cross-site scripting

315
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,959
attack where the target of the attack

316
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,800
the vulnerable component is the web

317
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,640
server but the target

318
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,320
is the user who visits the site or

319
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
clicks a link that's a scope change

320
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,760
because you've moved from attacking

321
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
a web server to attacking a user who is

322
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,320
not controlled by that web server

323
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
i hope that makes sense it's very this

324
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
this is the one that gets most people

325
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,560
tripped up

326
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
and then impact metrics i'm not going to

327
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,880
delve too much in depth on this because

328
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,000
infosec people we know what

329
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
confidentiality integrity availability

330
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,800
is

331
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,000
but this is the impact of those does it

332
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
impact confidentiality integrity

333
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
availability high low or none

334
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,079
so bringing that back to our attack

335
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,480
situation and that cve we talked earlier

336
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,240
the attack vector is network because

337
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,519
it's on the internet

338
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,360
it's low complexity there's no

339
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,640
privileges required

340
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
does not require user interaction the

341
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,079
scope is unchanged

342
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,560
because it does not allow us explaining

343
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,320
this vulnerability does not allow us to

344
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,640
access a different security scope

345
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,320
it's a high confidentiality impact

346
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,720
integrity and availability impact

347
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,160
and so when you calculate that out that

348
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
brings us to a 9.8 critical

349
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,440
which is where we're starting but let's

350
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,880
jump back into our story for a few

351
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,839
minutes

352
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
confluentist feels the exploit land its

353
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,519
crushing blow

354
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,200
penetrating his outer armor and

355
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,040
executing itself deep into the host

356
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,240
operating system

357
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,839
he calls out to his maker praying for

358
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,079
help oh great and beautiful

359
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,640
atlassia bless me and heal me protect me

360
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,600
from this evil

361
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,279
chat with my hip and turn your gaze of

362
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,279
your fisheye upon your faithful servant

363
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,200
intervene on my behalf and stride down

364
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
to my side a great and powerful

365
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,120
collaborator

366
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,600
suddenly a light shines down from above

367
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
confluentius feels the healing word of

368
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,880
official fix

369
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,079
as his creator atlassia blesses him

370
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,639
it's coming he hears in a whisper hold

371
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,399
strong child for the patch will be

372
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
applied after testing

373
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,360
all right so that brings us to the

374
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,279
temporal scores

375
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,519
as the name suggests these are specific

376
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,279
factors related to a vulnerability at a

377
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,040
specific point in time

378
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,399
so we talked about how the base scores

379
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,639
will never change the temporal scores

380
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,320
change based on the situation of when

381
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,079
you're writing it up

382
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,360
so let's go through each of these and

383
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
that'll make a whole lot more sense

384
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,519
exploit code maturity this is the

385
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,200
likelihood that

386
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,760
the exploit exists in the wild and it's

387
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,279
easy to exploit not just

388
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,200
is it being exploited in the wild but

389
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
how easy is it for an attacker to get

390
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,160
their hands on the code

391
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,200
is a great example of this an unproven

392
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,399
vulnerability means

393
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,600
that there is no available code there's

394
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
no available exploit code

395
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,399
um a proof of concept is exactly what it

396
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,120
sounds like

397
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,320
uh there may be a youtube video of

398
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,279
somebody doing it but there's not

399
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,120
necessarily release code

400
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,519
functional code is i can go on github

401
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,040
and find an exploit that with a little

402
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,880
bit of tweaking i can make work

403
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
and high maturity is there's a

404
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,079
metasploit module that comes

405
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,680
pre-packaged with metasploit

406
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,600
as as an example uh remediation level

407
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,440
is the availability of options now

408
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
what's interesting about

409
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,639
this one specifically but temporal

410
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,360
metrics in general is you don't have to

411
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
have that exploit code for exploit code

412
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,959
maturity you don't have to have

413
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,399
installed the patch

414
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,560
for remediation level to work it is

415
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,160
based on is it available

416
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,000
even just having it available lowers the

417
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
score whether it's an official fix

418
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
a temporary fix a workaround or if

419
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,040
there's not one those

420
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,079
change the score just because there is a

421
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,560
fix

422
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,920
somewhere and the report confidence is

423
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,279
the degree of confidence

424
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,360
in the existence of the vulnerability is

425
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,440
this truly a confirmed vulnerability in

426
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,160
this system

427
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,839
is it reasonable to assume that it's

428
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,279
vulnerable or do we just not know

429
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,160
so bringing it back to our specific case

430
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,320
there is an official fix and you'll see

431
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,079
that brought that down from a 9.8 to a

432
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,440
9.4

433
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,360
so just the fact that it has an official

434
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,639
fix makes it

435
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,720
less critical it's still critical but it

436
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,320
makes it less critical

437
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,680
and again you can see as i'm going

438
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,600
through i've got the cvss vector strings

439
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,399
on the bottom

440
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,000
again you can paste that right into the

441
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,199
calculator and get exactly what i'm

442
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,680
looking at

443
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,399
but all is still not well confluentis is

444
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,680
damaged and broken

445
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
weak and on his knees barely able to

446
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,079
stand the blessing from his maker helped

447
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,560
a bit

448
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,279
but he's still in critical condition he

449
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,959
is not long for this world

450
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,040
he feels the imminent shutdown of his

451
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
functions

452
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,279
and his denial of his service but then

453
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
just as his eyes close

454
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,639
he sees his friends approaching the

455
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,160
distance

456
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,320
hold the line cisco flame hand screams

457
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,760
as she casts firewall

458
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,199
segregating confluentius from the

459
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,519
internet we just need to hold out until

460
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,040
the patch army arrives

461
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,920
docker bellows enveloping confluence in

462
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,880
a container

463
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,839
making host exploitation more complex

464
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,519
arachne blue coat chitters inside her

465
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,480
spider speak

466
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
weaving a proxy web between the party

467
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,240
and the enemy protecting them from

468
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,079
accidentally accessing any malicious

469
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,439
locations on the battlefield

470
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,199
and that brings us to the environmental

471
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,680
scores remember we talked about the base

472
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800
scores never change

473
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
and that temporals change based on

474
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,399
situation at a given time

475
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,399
environmental changes are based on

476
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,680
specific use case

477
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,199
environment and implementation of the

478
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,279
product this is your chance

479
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,360
as an analyst or as a defender or

480
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,320
whatever you are

481
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,600
to be able to take into account your

482
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
specific situation i can't tell you how

483
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,240
many times

484
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,079
uh we've companies have worked for

485
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,079
contract a third-party testing firm

486
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,320
or looked at tenable results and it says

487
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,839
10.0 critical and everybody's running

488
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,800
around the hair and fire

489
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
and you look at it and it's like it's

490
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,880
the database that holds last week's

491
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,639
menus in the cafe

492
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,759
right and everyone's like this is a 10.0

493
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,639
but it is

494
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,480
that we we need to find a better way to

495
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,920
think about this because it's not that

496
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,800
big of a deal

497
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
and we should triage it lower so that's

498
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,320
where the environmental scores come into

499
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,639
play

500
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,120
is it allows you to change the cvss

501
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
score based on your specific

502
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,399
um situation you know i'm gonna go

503
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:58,959
through this

504
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,120
and like one more time the environmental

505
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
scores change based on the specific

506
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,480
situation where the base scores never

507
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,000
change

508
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,279
so the first half of the environmental

509
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,519
scores is the security requirements

510
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,120
uh these metrics enable analysts to

511
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,720
customize the cvss score

512
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
uh this is your ability to say how big

513
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
of a deal is the impact on

514
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,120
confidentiality integrity availability

515
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
uh so like i said earlier if you think

516
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,160
about the

517
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
case of the database holding last week's

518
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,720
cafe menus

519
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,360
though it is a still considered a high

520
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,639
probability of loss

521
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,279
of confidentiality say but i can modify

522
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,680
this

523
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,360
here by saying that it is a low

524
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,759
requirement for confidentiality it's not

525
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,920
a big deal if these menus get pwned

526
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,880
so i'm going to change the

527
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,600
confidentiality loss requirement to low

528
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,959
and that lowers the score because it's

529
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,639
not as big of a deal

530
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,040
from a business perspective the other

531
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,320
things we can do

532
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,360
is the modified base metrics this allows

533
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
you to change the base metrics based on

534
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
your current situation

535
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,160
uh for example if it is in

536
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
in the base score if you've got a

537
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,439
network as your

538
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,280
as your attack vector but this site is

539
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,959
only available on your intranet you can

540
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,799
lower that to adjacent network because

541
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,599
your specific case brings that down

542
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,359
one other thing i want to point out is

543
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,799
other than the base scores

544
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,439
none of these are required the temporal

545
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,640
and the environmental scores

546
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,880
if you do not have a need to change them

547
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,799
just leave them as not defined

548
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,319
otherwise your vector string will get

549
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,919
super long if you just have them copy

550
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,720
the existing ones

551
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,160
so in our specific situation we reduce

552
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,480
the attack vector to adjacent network

553
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
and we've lowered the confidentiality

554
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,480
requirements and we've modified the

555
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,240
attack complexity to make it high

556
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,960
and check that out we have lowered the

557
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,640
overall

558
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,919
severity from a 9.8 critical when we

559
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,000
started to a 6.9 medium

560
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,120
so you know what's really cool about

561
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
this put yourself in the mind of an i.t

562
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,280
professional say a systems engineer

563
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,520
network engineer you get past this

564
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,559
vulnerability right

565
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,400
someone sends you this vulnerability as

566
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,720
a 9.8 or whatever

567
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,120
is my alarm going off i'm sorry okay so

568
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,480
someone sends you this vulnerability as

569
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,919
a 9.8

570
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,120
and uh you can then use the

571
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,720
environmental scores

572
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,120
to find better ways other than just

573
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,760
patching

574
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,080
to reduce the residual risk like we

575
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,679
talked about you can put it

576
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,760
in behind a firewall or modify the

577
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,799
attack complexity

578
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,880
change the confidentiality requirements

579
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
those kind of things will allow you as

580
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,840
an i.t professional

581
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,320
to determine the best path forward wow

582
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,919
uh i hope you all can't hear that but my

583
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,760
alarm is going off i am sorry

584
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,320
uh all right the army has arrived and

585
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,360
they've brought with them

586
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,240
the patch this holy object when applied

587
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,520
to confluentist

588
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,280
protects him from the evil of cve

589
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,840
2019-3396

590
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,880
they make quick work of cryptokid666

591
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,160
who falls for the ground defeated

592
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,640
for now all right so takeaways uh cvss

593
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,160
isn't just an overall score and a pretty

594
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,760
qualitative severity ranking

595
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,720
uh being able to understand the entire

596
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,600
vector string

597
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,520
helps you get a better understanding of

598
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,960
the vulnerability

599
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
and like i said it professionals can use

600
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
this to calculate better ways to protect

601
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,280
your vulnerable systems in the interim

602
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
um and here's the the cbss calculator

603
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,480
link

604
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,360
uh and that's pretty much it for me uh i

605
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,840
want to

606
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,520
thank everybody who attended the talk

607
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,440
especially thanks to digital overdose

608
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,880
con for putting this on

609
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
i can be reached on twitter discord

610
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
github or email

611
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,880
at redwedgex pretty much everywhere i'll

612
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,720
put these slides up if anyone wants them

613
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,080
on my github later

614
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,919
today i'll create a repo called

615
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,840
slideshare uh

616
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,600
but i'll go ahead and take questions and

617
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
i appreciate everybody's time

618
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,120
that was such a badass talk oh my

619
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,600
goodness

620
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,120
thank you so much for giving that that

621
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,280
was by far the most entertaining

622
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
like story i've ever heard i was

623
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,360
cracking up so much during that i

624
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,000
like my my museum was like hey you're

625
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,799
muted by the way

626
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,960
it was great thank you for doing that um

627
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,480
i think we have a couple questions for

628
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,120
you

629
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,840
absolutely

630
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,760
alrighty first question how would you

631
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,640
break down a cvss for a non-dnd player

632
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
who doesn't understand

633
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,799
oh absolutely um the the big thing to

634
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,640
look about cbss is pretty much take into

635
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,000
account the calculator

636
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,520
um trying to go back to to an earlier

637
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,880
slide here

638
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,320
um the

639
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,840
the vector string really is the

640
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,600
important thing and one if you put this

641
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,960
side-by-side up against

642
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,280
um like looking at the calculator you

643
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,799
can really see that that when you learn

644
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,600
to read this

645
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,559
scope unchanged attack vector network

646
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,840
attack complexity low

647
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,000
premature is acquired high user

648
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,679
interaction none if you if you can

649
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,080
read the cvs vector string then you get

650
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,520
a better understanding

651
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,559
of the vulnerability itself uh even just

652
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,400
popping it into a calculator and seeing

653
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,320
what it looks like on the calculator

654
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
uh try and find that slide like this

655
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,679
this is what it would look like when you

656
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,280
click on things on the calculator on

657
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,400
first.org

658
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,240
site you're able to really understand

659
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,320
and it's not obviously a dmd thing by

660
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,840
default but i i think that was a good

661
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,400
way to

662
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,640
kind of make it fun understanding but in

663
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
general just looking at the scores

664
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,480
from more than just the number looking

665
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,559
at the actual metrics themselves gives

666
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,840
you a better idea of understanding the

667
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,440
vulnerability

668
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,840
all right um i had a question for you uh

669
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,960
specifically

670
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,039
on you know you mentioned that sometimes

671
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,440
you you see these uh

672
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
scores at the top of the reports that

673
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
are handed down to uh you know

674
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
see execs et cetera and it looks nice

675
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,400
right

676
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,440
it doesn't mean much does that sometimes

677
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,559
do you feel that might bias uh some

678
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,400
executives they're just like oh yeah

679
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,159
this is i don't know like a

680
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,440
like a seven it's not critical and like

681
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,440
the entirety staff is like yes but

682
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
do you feel that there is such a dynamic

683
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,520
that is very that has a tendency in the

684
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,480
industry

685
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,520
absolutely and i think that is why uh

686
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,600
relying on the base scores only is a

687
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,360
problem uh because if if

688
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,159
tenable or net expose or any of my tools

689
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,039
spit out a 9.8 and i throw it on a slide

690
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,520
the same as as is then that's not giving

691
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,720
the full picture that's why the

692
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,320
environmental scores

693
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,400
are so important because it allows you

694
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,600
as the professional making that

695
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,720
determination

696
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,880
to determine how big of a deal it really

697
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,760
is

698
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,679
um because you can modify those scores

699
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:30,799
you know

700
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,240
i've been in companies where they make

701
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,919
up their own local scoring rankings so

702
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,760
they say cdss doesn't give me a clear

703
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,320
picture

704
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,840
and it's because they're not realizing

705
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,000
that you can change the scores yourself

706
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
as the analyst for emphasis or

707
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,120
de-emphasis

708
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
if something comes out as a medium but

709
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,400
use the analysts say this is

710
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,799
super important this is a big deal

711
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,840
that's when you can run in the

712
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,880
environmental scores

713
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,480
and pump up the numbers now you

714
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,000
shouldn't arbitrarily just throw up

715
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
numbers to make them look higher

716
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
but using them correctly you do get a

717
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,200
better picture and and i'm not saying

718
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,039
cdss version 3 isn't flawed

719
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,960
uh there are some some people including

720
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,559
myself who see some of the metrics that

721
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,400
get spit out and go that is not as high

722
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
as it should be

723
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,679
or vice versa but it's a standard

724
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,039
industry standard starting point

725
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,360
awesome and uh well i guess as a

726
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,159
follow-up

727
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,200
um do you feel that this has

728
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,120
a that this has worked kind of bring uh

729
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,400
infosec people i guess from all over the

730
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
world together

731
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,480
on a general comprehension of um

732
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,000
vulnerabilities

733
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,640
yeah i i think that that cvss being the

734
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,039
it is

735
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,240
and it is pretty much the industry

736
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,159
standard there are other uh

737
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,919
frameworks out there to determine it

738
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,919
like threat or like dread and a few

739
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,200
others i believe

740
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,840
um but in general being able to have a

741
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,360
standard set

742
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,880
of understanding of the vulnerabilities

743
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,360
i mean that's why if you go google a cve

744
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
right now it's going to have a cdss

745
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,600
score

746
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,279
if you look at any tooling that's doing

747
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,039
automated vulnerability skin it's using

748
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,159
cvss

749
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,440
and the reason is because it's an

750
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,640
industry standard worldwide

751
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,159
okay awesome and another question i

752
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,559
don't think this one was answered oh

753
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,960
wait did you grab ghost protocols atomic

754
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,000
i did not okay sam how much subjectivity

755
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,679
comes into the later variables like

756
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,559
environmental

757
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,320
has it ever been enough to cause

758
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,679
conflict over priorities with your

759
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,039
colleagues over what should be handled

760
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,240
when

761
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,400
absolutely yeah and and because it's up

762
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,520
to the analyst

763
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,720
to make the determination on the

764
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,880
environmental scores it can cause

765
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,600
confusion

766
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,679
and and that's why the person doing the

767
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,960
analysis needs to have a good

768
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,640
understanding of the environment

769
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,840
you know if you bring in a third party

770
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
pen test firm and they do a quick pen

771
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,799
test and then give you

772
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,320
your scores that's where instead of just

773
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,400
briefing their report

774
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,240
somebody inside the company who has a

775
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,080
detailed understanding needs to be able

776
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,000
to say this is

777
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,679
this is this because and add the

778
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,840
environmental scores don't always rely

779
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,360
on on your testers to add the

780
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,520
environmental scores you know infosec

781
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,400
defenders or

782
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,240
or blue teamers or even i t

783
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,840
professionals are there

784
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,240
because they know their environment and

785
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,279
being able to

786
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,559
have those people have input of the

787
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,720
environmental scores uh makes it more of

788
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,640
a holistic approach more accurate

789
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
so yeah there there have been times when

790
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,320
i've argued with people over a score

791
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,679
and it can create a false sense of

792
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,360
security where something looks like a

793
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,039
medium but it should be a critical

794
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,039
or something's a critical and it comes

795
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,159
out as critical and should be

796
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,159
medium and that's and that's really

797
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
where the analysis work happens you know

798
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,039
i i talk a lot in in my job about

799
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,159
automated tools and

800
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,840
and automated tools and report

801
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,679
generation and things that spit out

802
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,159
reports are great but if you use a tool

803
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,360
like faraday and i'm not talking about

804
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,279
about fair day i use it and i love it

805
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,440
but it's just going to create a report

806
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,960
of the findings

807
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,120
it's not going to do the analysis for

808
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,039
you and maybe that's another talk of

809
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,799
pair for is actually how to analyze the

810
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,000
finding but

811
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,480
but the analysis is so important and so

812
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,000
overlooked when all you're doing is

813
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,120
spitting out

814
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,679
the name of a cve the qsr and

815
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
step-by-step walkthrough

816
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,760
really understanding what the

817
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,880
vulnerability is

818
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,919
is super important

819
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,679
awesome uh do we have anything else no i

820
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,520
think that was the last question

821
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,960
we really appreciate you taking your

822
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,559
time to come and present this for us it

823
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,159
was so much fun

824
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,400
i loved it i think you've had nothing

825
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,840
but great feedback coming in

826
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
so good job thank you for such an

827
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,120
entertaining and

828
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,840
and informative presentation today happy

829
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,039
to be here and thanks for putting this

830
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:27,600
on

831
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,039
of course thanks for coming on yeah
