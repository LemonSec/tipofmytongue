00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,799
hello everyone

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,040
and welcome to my to the conference i

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,800
hope you all are safe and having

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,519
a good time listening to these amazing

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,160
speakers

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,199
thank you for tuning in my today's topic

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,880
is about introduction to social

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,720
engineering where we'll be discussing

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,080
the different types of social

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,119
engineering attacks

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,080
and how to protect against them i'm

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
thick

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,920
and here is a small introduction about

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,399
me and the industrial management

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,040
graduate

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,320
i graduated in september 2020. i

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,200
got myself system engineering and which

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,559
i'll be

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,360
joining in another week other than that

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,000
i

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,399
am interested everything about

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,360
technology

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,000
i write blogs and i also got my ch

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,719
certificate last year

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,280
here is the agenda for today's talk

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,199
today we'll be learning about what

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,719
social engineering is

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,120
who are the targets the different types

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,239
of targets of

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,200
targets or social engineering attacks

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,040
how a victim's behavior can be

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,320
manipulated

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
for the attacker's game then

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,320
anatomy of a scam called here we'll

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,200
discuss

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
how a scam is strategically planned and

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,200
executed for money lastly we'll talk

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,240
about quantum

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,200
measures to keep away from these attacks

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,000
so what is social engineering here is

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,280
this

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
nice internet definition about social

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,479
engineering and also

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,600
cute picture of a dog who is saying the

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,960
101 of hacking

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,759
is social engineer i mean it's not wrong

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,560
because it

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,680
is unlike other attacks doesn't make any

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
use of special tools

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,640
but only psychological manipulation

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,520
yes social engineering is a con or a

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,640
scam technique

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
of tricking people to give you

54
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,719
confidential information

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,880
when i say confidential information it

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,799
doesn't necessarily have to be something

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,360
top secret it can be something simple

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,479
and yet effective

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
like date of birth your pet's name

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
where you live where you work and so on

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,000
the most common targets of social

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,120
engineering attacks

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
are technical support executives

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,920
helpdesk professionals

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,000
their job is to provide support to their

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
customers and to maintain good customer

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
relationship with the company

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,040
a hacker could impersonate as a client

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
asking for advice

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
or to help troubleshoot a certain

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,560
problem and could take advantage of the

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
situation

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,959
it is their job and they ought to be

74
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
polite and nice

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,519
and helpful some executives fall for the

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,080
spray

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,400
out of lack of awareness and just by

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
believing that they are

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
doing their job next common targets

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,400
are job seekers they upload their

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,959
resumes on various job portals

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
their primary information can be easily

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,879
accessed by hackers

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,959
but this data hackers could plan and

85
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,159
execute their

86
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,200
social engineering attack on them

87
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,440
after that comes older people who are

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,280
not much familiar with technology

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
which makes them an easy target for the

90
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,519
attackers

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,720
lastly it is said that the success of a

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,080
social engineering attack

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,159
depends on the confidence of the

94
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,200
attacker

95
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
and the gullibility of the victim so the

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,159
next attack could be on me

97
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,120
you or anyone basically end users

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
there are no fixed number of social

99
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,280
engineering attacks

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,440
the list goes on depending on how smart

101
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,159
and creative the attacker is i've listed

102
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,599
a few attacks here

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
and separated them in two different

104
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,879
groups

105
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,080
first group is about as technical or

106
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,439
computer-based attacks

107
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,560
which include fishing proper fishing

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,239
spimming next group is non-technical or

109
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
human waste attack

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,560
which includes impersonation shoulder

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,360
surfing

112
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
dumpster diving and wishing

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,120
first attack under our technical attacks

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,639
is email fishing or simply fishing

115
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,520
as the name suggests phishing is a cyber

116
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,479
attack that is carried out via me

117
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,120
a basic phishing attack attempts to

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
trick the target into doing

119
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,960
what the scammer wants in today's world

120
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,040
kids and teenagers don't listen to their

121
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
parents well then how do you expect

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,479
adults

123
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,639
to pay attention to a stranger and give

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,040
them their information

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
here is a picture of adago doing tricks

126
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
because his promise treat later

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,800
what about humans save logic

128
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,360
you promise them something and they fall

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,000
for the trap

130
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,919
so how do this email fishing work

131
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,400
the goal is to entice the victim just

132
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
enough so they'll share their

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,039
login details and other sensitive data

134
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,440
their emails are designed to deceive and

135
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,600
trick receptance

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
to take action immediately firstly the

137
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
attacker will craft an email

138
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
with a catchy subject and the body of

139
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,520
the mail could be

140
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
anything as follows like they might say

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,600
that they noticed

142
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,479
a suspicious activity or a login attempt

143
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,759
from your account

144
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,680
or they could claim that there is a

145
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,440
problem with your account

146
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,639
or some payment information

147
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,680
they could say that they want you to

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,479
confirm some

149
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,800
personal information like here in this

150
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,360
first picture

151
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,639
they could include a fake invoice of

152
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,759
a item that you never purchased and they

153
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,039
might ask you to click

154
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,520
a link to make the payment or they might

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
provide another link

156
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,199
saying if you have not ordered this you

157
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,400
could just

158
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,720
cancel your order by clicking this link

159
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,400
or they could just say

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
that you're eligible to register for a

161
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,919
government refund

162
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,560
the possibilities are endless they could

163
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,840
be anything

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,919
this so when what happens when

165
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,720
when the customer or the victim clicks

166
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,319
on the link

167
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,880
it is redirected to a fake website which

168
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,120
looks exactly like the real website

169
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
while being redirected a malicious

170
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,479
script

171
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,319
activates in the background to hijack

172
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,240
the user's session cookie

173
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,360
and next attack is about

174
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,120
pop-ups what is a pop-up it is a gui

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,319
display

176
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
which are generated by websites to

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
provide additional information

178
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,039
or guidance to the users here's pictures

179
00:06:59,039 --> 00:06:59,759
of

180
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,120
pop-ups which look absolutely normal but

181
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,440
nothing harmful in this here is

182
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
something that is asking

183
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,680
for your you to sign into your youtube

184
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,319
account

185
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,000
and the second one asking you to

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,599
register for the

187
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,639
nike's newsletters to get their

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,759
exclusive offers

189
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,000
see nothing harmful in that but what

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
about these

191
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,759
in many cases cyber criminals in fact

192
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,479
legitimate websites with malicious code

193
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,720
that causes these pop-up messages to

194
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,759
appear

195
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,039
when people visit them these fake

196
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,120
warnings will be typically about

197
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,400
security of their computer or of their

198
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,840
device

199
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
after that they prompt the user to

200
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,599
download a fix

201
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,280
which is actually a malware disguised as

202
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,599
an

203
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,720
anti-virus application

204
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,400
trust me if there were actually problems

205
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
some issues with your computer a

206
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,800
legitimate id support will not ask you

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,479
to

208
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,560
fix it using a pop-up message

209
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,560
next one is about spimming spamming is a

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,360
variant of spam that exploits

211
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,599
instant messaging platforms to flood

212
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,879
spam across

213
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,680
the networks attackers use boards to

214
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,319
harvest

215
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,120
instant messaging ids and spread spam

216
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,199
our next group is about non-technical

217
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,400
attacks the first one

218
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,519
is impersonation impersonation is

219
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,519
basically pretending to

220
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,279
be someone a classic example of

221
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,360
impersonation could be two twin brothers

222
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,799
taking each other's place

223
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,480
to play pranks on their friends or

224
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
family

225
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,360
websites are the first point of contact

226
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,240
for consumers

227
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,120
using these websites one can not only a

228
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,240
review

229
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,399
company's products and services but also

230
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,279
can

231
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,080
place their order the impersonation

232
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,720
attack

233
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
targets reputed organization spoofing

234
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
their domain

235
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
criminals will copy the content of the

236
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,399
organization's

237
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,040
legitimate domain like logo brand

238
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,000
layout of the site the color to misguide

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,279
people to use their

240
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,040
fake website in order to steal

241
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,480
credentials

242
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
or to distribute malware another popular

243
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,600
impersonation attack

244
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
is social media fake social media

245
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,760
profile

246
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,640
or commonly known as cat fashion

247
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,080
next one is shoulder surfing

248
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,120
being nosey is considered rude but what

249
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
if

250
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,760
looking over someone's shoulder could

251
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
get you money

252
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,920
hold that thought let me tell you what

253
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,880
shoulder surfing

254
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,240
is it is using direct observation

255
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,040
techniques

256
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,200
like looking over someone's shoulder to

257
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,080
get information

258
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,279
other than that binoculars

259
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,920
video cameras and other optical devices

260
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,240
are also used in shoulders of it

261
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,640
this simple technique could nab valuable

262
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,160
information such as

263
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,920
username passwords atm pins

264
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,160
credit card numbers and so on and this

265
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,320
information can be used for

266
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,160
financial gain atms are common target

267
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,519
location

268
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,519
other than that shoulder surfing is

269
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,560
generally

270
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,680
generally takes place at a crowded local

271
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,720
transport

272
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,160
bank atmq supermarket and etc

273
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,720
next one is dumpster diving dumpster

274
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,279
diving

275
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,680
is searching trash for useful

276
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
information

277
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,040
to say one man's trash is another man's

278
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,160
treasure

279
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,000
surprisingly a lot of personal

280
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,839
information is discarded

281
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,040
without destruction such as old

282
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,240
hard drives cd dvds

283
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,040
test printouts that have ip addresses on

284
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,839
it

285
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,480
sticky notes with username or passwords

286
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,959
information can be recovered from drives

287
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,040
that have been improperly formatted

288
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,240
or erased in medical records like here

289
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,839
in the second picture

290
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,279
in other personal documents that could

291
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,440
contain personally identifiable

292
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,880
information or pii which

293
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,839
must be destroyed or the organization

294
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,680
could be exposed to breaches

295
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,599
or worse potential fines

296
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,200
this picture of what all information you

297
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,160
could get

298
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,200
from dumpster diving like phone numbers

299
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,480
names passwords access codes

300
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,680
network diagrams credit card receipts

301
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,959
and so on last one

302
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,560
is fishing phishing is a cyber crime

303
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,800
that uses the phone to steal

304
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,440
personal confidential information from

305
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,720
victims

306
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
cyber criminals use social engineering

307
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,240
tactics to convince

308
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,440
victims to give up private information

309
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,000
such as

310
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
account numbers passwords otps or

311
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,600
other financial details scammers

312
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,839
might say that your account has been

313
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,440
compromised by claiming

314
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,240
to represent your bank and offer you to

315
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
help you

316
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,360
using threats strong and forceful

317
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,399
language

318
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,800
or they might sound convincing just to

319
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,240
make their victims

320
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
feel as though they have no other option

321
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,160
than to provide the

322
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,519
information that is asked by them

323
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,399
coronavirus outbreak has generated brand

324
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
new opportunities for the scammers

325
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,880
to get creative with their attacks

326
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,839
this slide will see the anatomy of a

327
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,600
scan call

328
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,639
in today's social media era it is easy

329
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,560
to get

330
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,200
primary information of a person

331
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,600
the person who is calling you could just

332
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,880
confirm your details

333
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,920
by doing just a small footprinting

334
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,079
then they could impersonate as an

335
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,360
authority figure

336
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
claiming that they're from your bank or

337
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,639
from a

338
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,600
reputed company job portals could be

339
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,040
anything

340
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,079
then they would build

341
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,120
trust by talking to you giving you more

342
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,920
information

343
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,560
about why they have called you this and

344
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,839
that

345
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,959
next computers usually

346
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,040
work binary either it is zero one

347
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,680
true or false but that is not the case

348
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,279
with humans

349
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,399
in between a yes and no there is maybe

350
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,000
i guess i don't know a lot of options

351
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,360
the attackers or scammers intention

352
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,800
is to get you from that maybe face

353
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,079
to a yes face they can't take a note one

354
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:04,399
on

355
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,839
no as an answer after a lot of

356
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,680
talking and building trust they'll

357
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,360
convince you to pay some

358
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,360
amount if you show some skepticism or

359
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,000
skeptical about paying or not then

360
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,519
they'll pressurize you

361
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,360
they'll tell you they'll create a false

362
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
sense of

363
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,800
emergency saying this has to be done

364
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,160
with now or

365
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
within the next 10 minutes or you could

366
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
lose your money you could lose your

367
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,399
information or they could tell that your

368
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,560
computer has been infected with virus if

369
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,360
you don't

370
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,600
do what i say you could lose all your

371
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,480
data

372
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,839
they will scare you and this might push

373
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,880
you to doing

374
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,160
something that the attackers want you to

375
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,319
do

376
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,320
how to identify a scam call if you feel

377
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,040
that the person is reading from a script

378
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,360
or

379
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,240
is not able to answer your specific

380
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,680
questions

381
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,079
or is asking irrelevant personal

382
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,279
questions or seems unprofessional

383
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,279
or i had a person who called me

384
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,480
and spoke addressed me as dear and

385
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,720
that is that was my first red flag

386
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,079
and your biggest red flag could be when

387
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,120
the person asked me to pay money no job

388
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,079
portals

389
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,480
or companies will ask you to pay money

390
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,519
in exchange of

391
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,560
interview or a job so don't

392
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,359
pay money

393
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,680
here is a cosmetic diagram

394
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,399
let's think about why people are

395
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,320
becoming victims of social engineering

396
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,120
attack

397
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,000
i mean social engineering attack has is

398
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,320
not something recent it has been

399
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,480
there for a while now but why are still

400
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,160
people why is the people

401
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,880
falling for it because it is working

402
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,440
almost

403
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,000
every damn time people are still falling

404
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,440
for it

405
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,079
let's see the behaviors or emotions that

406
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,279
leads to in

407
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,360
social engineering attack like lack of

408
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
awareness

409
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
i mean they might not know that all

410
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,800
these attacks exist

411
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,759
or greediness they want that lottery

412
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,720
money

413
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,279
that has come in their mail or they

414
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:17,759
might

415
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,199
fear of losing their data

416
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,480
their next is trust or

417
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,240
sheer ignorance or humans natural desire

418
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,839
to be helpful

419
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,880
all these emotions might

420
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
be can be manipulated and can lead to

421
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,839
social engineering attack

422
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,600
what are the natural behaviors of humans

423
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,320
that can be used against them in

424
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,360
if an attacker is talking to you in

425
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,000
person

426
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,480
he might be very keen and absurd in

427
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,279
nature

428
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,160
he might appreciate you he'll provide

429
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,480
that external validation

430
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,800
if you're feeling left out he might make

431
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
you feel welcomed

432
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,640
or included in a group if you're trying

433
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,039
to be

434
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,000
that know it all person then he could

435
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,599
boost your ego

436
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,319
he could do anything just to gain your

437
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,959
trust

438
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,240
and take information from you

439
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,439
the other emotions that are included are

440
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,880
fear guilt panic all this

441
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
could be manipulated and used against

442
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,439
you

443
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,679
so what are the countermeasures that you

444
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,080
can take

445
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,919
to stay away from these

446
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,760
attacks first one is don't click that

447
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,160
link

448
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,360
don't click that damn click it could be

449
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,400
about if you find it suspicious don't

450
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,520
click it there are browser extensions

451
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,000
that could alert you about malicious

452
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,080
sites find out and use them

453
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
a hacker could misspell a word

454
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,440
like ie instead of ei or ei instead of

455
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,720
ie

456
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,200
and make it look like a legit site or a

457
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,240
legit

458
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,280
domain replacing rn

459
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
with m or m with rm

460
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
might look alike

461
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,520
they are very hard to notice then

462
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
protect your atm pin codes by

463
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,080
maintaining social distance

464
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,919
always watch out for people who are

465
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,000
trying to shoulder itself

466
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
use contact with patients digitize

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,200
digitalize use fingerprints or biometric

468
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,240
readers

469
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,919
to minimize the need to enter a passcode

470
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,400
use privacy screen protector that can

471
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,200
help you

472
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,960
limit the field of view to your screen

473
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,840
but that doesn't mean the attacker can't

474
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,360
notice your keystrokes

475
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,880
but kind of does the job

476
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
then locking waste pins

477
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,160
just to protect your trash from dumpster

478
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,520
diving

479
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,200
and shredding the confidential

480
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
information

481
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,080
using caller id apps that will alert you

482
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,480
from

483
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,760
spam calls always be cautious

484
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,200
always be skeptical don't

485
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,480
trust anyone soon

486
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,000
the key take away from this presentation

487
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,919
or what i like to call summary is

488
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,000
that we learn about the types of social

489
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,360
engineering attacks

490
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,200
what happens and how to identify a scam

491
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,240
call

492
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,840
the cause and effect diagram or

493
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,240
popularly known as fishbone diagram of a

494
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,039
social engineering attack

495
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,200
human behaviors that are used against

496
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
them for manipulation

497
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,840
and lastly countermeasures to protect

498
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,639
from attacks

499
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,679
these are the references i used for this

500
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,600
talk

501
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,080
thank you i'll leave

502

to present with us this was such a

511
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,520
fantastic talk and you have a couple

512
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,159
questions

513
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,600
atomic if you'd like to start us off

514
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
with those i can

515
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,240
yes um right so uh

516
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,600
imagine now you're quite a um

517
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,120
experienced social engineer but uh

518
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,280
imagine you are a

519
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
you were a beginner social engineer what

520
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,400

532
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,799
have a lot of patience a lot of grown-up

533
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,880
adults don't open up that easily

534
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,159
you need to know what triggers them

535
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,159

uh that you would use in social

577
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
engineering so not necessarily to

578
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,000
prevent it but to actually

579
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,159

uh what i personally feel is there quite

585
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:26,880
a few

586
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,480
osid things that you could do

587
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,320
like just to plan get some

588
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,200

589
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,840

his whole career

592
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,080

information on that

594
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,919
