binary the spotlight and i'll take the

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,840
lead on voice

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,320

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,279

until you do it

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,480

things come of this initiative

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,200
so biz apps is a new approach to data

to drive business outcomes this ops

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,160

change the way your teams collaborate to

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,680
store

69
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,840
analyze and report on data

70
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,319
we have to start thinking like an

71
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,360
innovator

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
because it starts with us i want to

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,959
share with you today

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,680
a little about biz ops in motion and why

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,879
your business

76
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,680
be it a sole prop a consulting firm a

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
product-based company

78
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
or corporate operation would make use of

79
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
these techniques

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,120
bizops in motion is an agile response to

81
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
innovative thinking

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,640
and essentially guides people to

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,000
automate processes

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,879
and systems so that they can have more

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,760
time

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,400
to be more creative and do what they

87
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,340
love best

88
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,529
[Music]

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,360
so the biz bizops role is to analyze

90
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,239
performance and recommend improvement

91
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,280
to analyze the market it's about agile

92
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,080
planning and

93
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,200
innovation swatting is a very big part

94
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,440
of

95
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,480
bizop's role it is to create and

96
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,200
maintain

97
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
business dashboards which i love doing

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
be really fun

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
to produce health reports of a business

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,640
and their cloud readiness

101
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,519
to project manage to automate daily

102
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,080
process

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,959
across all business departments to look

104
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:35,920
at high level

105
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
of business systems and procedures to

106
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,760
find

107
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,799
effective and efficient ways to innovate

108
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,560
to help departments collaborate with

109
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,799
each other to ensure good flow within

110
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,360
the business

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
so a few years ago i was sitting in my

112
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,120
office

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
going through my daily pile of slips and

114
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,040
paperwork

115
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,959
in the accounting field there's a lot of

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,879
paperwork and manual checking and

117
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,439
printing

118
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,640
and capturing and while i was working it

119
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,760
dawned on me that

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,519
there could be an easier way to get my

121
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,000
reporting out much faster

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
and that's the day my journey began

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,759
i began using my knowledge of data to

124
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,199
tell a story

125
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,759
i began to see the goals of a business

126
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
and not just the outcomes needed

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,040
i took a personality test online and it

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,440
said i had a hacker's mentality

129
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,280
and i like to find shortcuts and get the

130
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
job done

131
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,960
well at least that's how i read it i

132
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
have a lot of respect for hackers

133
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,520
and and i'm an aspiring script kitty

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,840
myself

135
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,280
i think adopting this mentality of

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,800
moving out of the old

137
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,240
and into the new finding optimization

138
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,880
and becoming more creative is the way of

139
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
the future

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
the digital process automation market is

141
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,240
worth

142
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,960
6.76 billion us dollars

143
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,080
by 2023 this figure is set to rise

144
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,400
to 12.61 billion us dollars

145
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,680
74 percent of organizations say they are

146
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,560
actively looking for new use cases for

147
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,639
automation

148
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,759
between 2017 and 2019

149
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,080
companies use automation for mission

150
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
critical processes

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,479
and that rose from 16 to 50

152
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,800
a quarter of uk businesses are still

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
only in the early

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,720
stages of automation and keen to change

155
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
this

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
ninety percent of employees are being

157
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,560
burdened with boring and repetitive

158
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,440
tasks

159
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,320
which could easily be automated

160
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,560
sixty-eight percent of employees

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
have suffered from work overload in

162
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
which they have too much to do on a

163
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
daily basis

164
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,639
and 81 of workforces are anticipated to

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,039
reach

166
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,400
breaking point by 2020 which is where

167
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
we're currently sitting

168
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,120
if they do not tap or into automation to

169
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,800
handle the volume of tasks being

170
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,440
generated

171
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,720
so fast track five years into my search

172
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,319
down this rabbit hole

173
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,120
in 2020 i decided to become certified in

174
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,479
the thick of covert

175
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
in business systems and analysis

176
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,840
needless to say i didn't sleep for

177
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
months on end

178
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,199
so one morning while sitting at my home

179
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,440
office desk around the beginning of

180
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,680
november 2020

181
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
i started to dig a little deeper into

182
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,680
the world of cyber security

183
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,000
i sat and googled for about three hours

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,800
and came across

185
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
oceans i had to have a little chuckle to

186
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,880
myself on

187
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,599
how i could up my stalking skills but i

188
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,599
came to discover that oceans

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,360
can be used in the corporate world as

190
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,599
well

191
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
i came across a few databases of

192
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,120
companies that showcase their websites

193
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,880
and went down that path

194
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,199
i remember thinking to myself how are

195
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,520
they running their business processes

196
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,759
are they efficient not only in the

197
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,560
development

198
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,880
development and innovation but the

199
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,599
process

200
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,479
innovation as well

201
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,599
i contacted some of my clients and had a

202
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
look at their portfolios again

203
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,840
trying to piece together how they could

204
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
become that one step

205
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,840
better in achieving their goals in

206
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
focusing on their passion

207
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,280
and their business and shifting their

208
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,880
time spent on mundane processes

209
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,360
i incorporated my model of development

210
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,039
and system automation

211
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,960
to now include process automation

212
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,120
in tech lingo is at the heart of the

213
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,319
industry

214
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,720
but i needed to find out more for myself

215
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,919
what systems

216
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,759
and process automation meant for me

217
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,919
i came to discover that while being able

218
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,039
to give my clients

219
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,199
a more efficient way of doing business

220
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,120
by using automation

221
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,919
to do their finances and their sales

222
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:06,560
people

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
were still at the focal point of the

224
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,759
business

225
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,400
it's not just what the system can do but

226
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,720
the experience the users have

227
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,680
when using the systems created are they

228
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
excited

229
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,759
are they engaged gamification

230
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,759
another apple to add to my basket of

231
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,039
ideas

232
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,840
so i took systems automation and process

233
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,879
engagement

234
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,840
and made apple pie

235
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,799
why automate the business process

236
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,640
the use of technology to automate

237
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,719
business process was popularized by

238
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,679
henry ford's

239
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,880
moving assembly line in 1913.

240
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,120
ford's assembly line reduced the time it

241
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,279
took to manufacture a car

242
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,480
from more than 12 hours to two and a

243
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,320
half hours

244
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
today's business process automation

245
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,880
software and apps do the same for modern

246
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,200
business

247
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
collapsing development and deploying

248
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,640
processes from

249
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,839
months to hours

250
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,120
process automation continues this legacy

251
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
it uses software and apps to simplify

252
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,200
and speed up complicated workflows while

253
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,120
giving you transparency

254
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
and control over all parts of the

255
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
process

256
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,800
freeing you from routine so you can

257
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,360
focus

258
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,640
on what matters and zone bizops bridging

259
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
the gap

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,480
is the golden rule for every businessman

261
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,600
is this

262
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,839
put yourself in your customers shoes

263
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,000
today i deal with businesses to help

264
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
bridge the gap between efficiency and

265
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,360
innovation

266
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,200
my clients time is money a few years ago

267
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,040
i asked my daughter what she wanted for

268
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,320
a birthday

269
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,360
she asked me if i could buy her

270
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,720
more time and this head home for me

271
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,880
i've adopted this principle in my work

272
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,720
where i now tell my clients

273
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,480
that my service in consulting and

274
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
innovation is giving them

275
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,680
just that more time

276
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,160
taking risks is being open to people and

277
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
ideas

278
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
business is about risk taking and

279
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,079
incorporating innovation through

280
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,839
change how we do daily tasks

281
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,120
and that is a risk worth taking

282
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,200
it's the feeling of truly enjoying your

283
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,880
life and the desire

284
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,839
to make the very best of it happiness is

285
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,120
the secret source

286
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,760
that can help us be and do our best and

287
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,519
here's what researchers found

288
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,399
when they studied happy people happy

289
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,360
people

290
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,320
are more successful

291
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,240
in bizops we aim to align departments

292
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,120
technology

293
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,839
and people the barriers to success with

294
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,959
automation

295
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
is not only systems but processes

296
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,560
and they are the key to happier working

297
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,440
environments

298
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,560
and more cash inflow a modern

299
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,160
and dynamic growth requires change

300
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
it also requires vision and is indeed an

301
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,040
art form of engineering

302
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,600
i enjoy what i do and take pride in the

303
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,320
companies i help

304
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,800
the one story i'd like to share with you

305
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,480
is about a company that came to me

306
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,720
asking for innovation

307
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,320
they were laying out a couple of ten

308
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,760
thousand each month on seven systems

309
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,200
and they were getting rather annoyed

310
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
with having to remember logins to every

311
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,079
platform

312
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,839
and sending their clients running around

313
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,440
between them

314
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,200
they also kept losing track of their

315
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,720
slips in their pockets

316
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,120
after a long day of work and forgetting

317
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
to take them out

318
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,200
so i took on a project and we took their

319
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,360
system from a legacy mindset

320
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,320
into automation they now don't even need

321
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,600
to keep their slips

322
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,240
or worry about reconciliation as they

323
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,600
just have to take a picture of the

324
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,480
expense

325
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,079
and it gets recorded in the systems

326
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,680
database

327
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,279
pushed through to approval the line

328
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,680
manager and reconciled

329
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,480
automatically at month end the

330
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
accountant now

331
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,240
only has to check it once to make sure

332
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,160
everything is in order

333
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
and the process cycle is complete for

334
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,639
the month

335
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,120
the company now not only has an

336
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
efficient system

337
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,760
but are today officially paperless and

338
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,480
sustainable

339
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,160
they use the stats from the system

340
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,959
dashboard to promote specials

341
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,680
that are actually making more sales the

342
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,800
marketing team

343
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
now has fun creating gifs and

344
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,240
presentations

345
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,720
and not looking for answers in hidden

346
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
meaningless data

347
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,279
with data that actually tells a story

348
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,200
they saved just over half the money they

349
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,720
used to spend

350
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
and were able to give increases to their

351
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,000
staff

352
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,480
the biggest challenge for me is changing

353
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,000
the mindset

354
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,320
i like to tell the story of stepping

355
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,079
back and looking at the company

356
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,360
as a whole and how everyone can succeed

357
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,360
together and optimize all areas

358
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,000
we need to be in the mindset of forever

359
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,920
a student

360
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
being open to learning will give people

361
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,120
and companies

362
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,320
the tools and power to succeed

363
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,000
i found this out when i started learning

364
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,920
python i was so

365
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,639
out of my comfort zone but diving deeper

366
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,519
into it

367
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,000
i now get excited when i discover more

368
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,320
sql and python presentation templates

369
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
and

370
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,920
the ideas

371
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,560
streamlining the entire business model

372
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:42,880
and

373
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,399
researching my clients where they are

374
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,600
was the best thing i ever did now when i

375
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
take on new clients i aim to understand

376
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
where they are where they envision

377
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,040
themselves in

378
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,480
six months one year five years

379
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
i want to grow with them on their

380
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,639
journey and not just give a system

381
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,839
on automation in south africa we have a

382
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,480
saying

383
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,680
ubuntu it means a person

384
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,360
is a person because of other people

385
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
it means it takes an agile approach to

386
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,160
change and innovation

387
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
it's not just about making money and

388
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,240
innovating the business to be ahead

389
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,160
in the game and move into the fourth

390
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,079
industrial revolution

391
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,720
but actually in a part of each and every

392
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
one of those journeys

393
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
it's about seeing the users of the

394
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
system moving into creating

395
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,079
rather than duplicating documents it's

396
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,240
about giving an experience

397
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,199
not a process it's about connecting

398
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,199
people and helping businesses

399
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,639
focus on their customers via the stories

400
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,360
they tell

401
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,560
in their data it's about reaching

402
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,040
and touching the lives of employees in

403
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,360
every department in the company

404
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,000
so their voices are heard because i

405
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,399
believe

406
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,880
employees are the company's biggest

407
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,639
asset

408
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,959
it's about having fun and bringing data

409
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,160
to life

410
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,880
it's about staying agile innovative and

411
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,000
real

412
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,560
that to me is biz ups in motion

413
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,399
so i want to thank you for your time and

414
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,320
a big thank you to the team for this

415
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
amazing opportunity

416
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
and please feel free to reach out to me

417
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,320
for a chat or to connect

418
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
or for any questions you might have

419
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,800
awesome um i'm checking

420
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
the various feeds to see if we we've had

421
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,079
some questions

422
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,199
uh trickle in

423
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,759
i do have one for you personally um

424
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,160
imagine uh so you know you have these

425
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,880
pipelines

426
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,480
that you're setting up your automation

427
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,839
can you easily integrate various

428
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,800
security processes into these uh

429
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
these automation pipelines

430
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,279
yeah definitely so once the

431
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,399
systems are set uh that is the next step

432
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,920
to to secure the systems

433
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,680
okay and is that something

434
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,320
and if you don't feel comfortable

435
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,199
telling us this

436
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
is that something that uh companies ask

437
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,040
of you regularly

438
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,839
or is that something that companies go

439
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,320
like

440
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,800
okay we're going for automation security

441
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,560
is coming on later

442
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,079
yeah so i think pen testing is

443
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,759
definitely a a very

444
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,040
big uh deal in in the industry and

445
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,600
it's something that has to be done as

446
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,360
the the final leg and then

447
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
to continue that process throughout the

448
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,399
the life of the system

449
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,240
um so i i've only started in pen testing

450
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,680
myself so i would usually

451
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
hand that over to somebody else but now

452
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:00,880
i am

453
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
getting into that myself and it's really

454
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,839
really exciting

455
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,280
yeah do you have any resources uh

456
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,520
relating to you know getting into

457
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,480
automation

458
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,439
uh i guess i mean you did uh you know

459
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,559
you did the degree

460
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,919
where you learned a lot of things and

461
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,760
then you got a ton of stuff

462
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,319
you know from experience but are there

463
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,079
any resources you would recommend to

464
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,359
get into this i definitely i can share

465
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,320
them after the presentation

466
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
sure thing we also got a question

467
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,000
trickling from the youtube

468
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
what are some of the issues businesses

469
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,120
face when first deciding to use

470
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,760
automation

471
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,240
that's a good question i think the first

472
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,440
thing that comes to mind

473
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,039
is change of mind so a lot of it is very

474
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,559
new and say a company has been doing the

475
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,400
same thing for years

476
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
like take the slips for example they

477
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,840
would have to then change their mindset

478
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,480
to

479
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,280
allow for automation to take those

480
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,400
processes

481
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,160
and do it for them and that's a trust

482
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
issue

483
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,320
and so it's guiding people through that

484
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,640
and

485
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,400
once it has a flow and emotion then

486
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,840
from there it's it's pretty easy

487
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,919
awesome and then automation can lead

488
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,960
often to uh

489
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
can often lead to accountability how do

490
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
you encourage employers and employees to

491
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,280
adopt a new process

492
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,600
i think it's hitting home for them to

493
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
say you know you're spending so much

494
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,679
time

495
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,799
doing x y and z um when

496
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,960
that's not that shouldn't be your job

497
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,559
your job should be to

498
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,080
create uh something new or to say for

499
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,520
a marketing team and to use the data to

500
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,640
innovate with it and not to in that

501
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,400
department perhaps do reports

502
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,480
so encouraging them would be to

503
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,280
make them aware of where they could be

504
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,160
heading towards

505
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,320
definitely um we've had a question uh

506
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,360
cycling back to automation um so there

507
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,880
there's a lot of standards out there in

508
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,160
the world of tech uh most

509
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,799
typically uh iso 27001

510
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,039
um does bizops and your

511
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,080
experience cater to these standards or

512
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,400
is it more of an ad hoc approach

513
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
i think because it's so agile in nature

514
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
incorporating the many different forms

515
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,360
that

516
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
play into business in particular you

517
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,880
know we would

518
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,760
assess the business or the company and

519
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,720
see

520
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,120
what they would need and what

521
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
certifications they would have to comply

522
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,760
to

523
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,960
and then go from there so

524
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,080
it's definitely about taking

525
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
many different aspects and putting it

526
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,240
all into the basket and it is agile

527
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,720
and so it happens it's a continuous

528
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,360
process

529
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,799
throughout the life of the system

530
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,840
fantastic i'm not entirely certain if

531
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,200
this is a joke question

532
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,159
but um what one of our sponsors has

533
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,440
