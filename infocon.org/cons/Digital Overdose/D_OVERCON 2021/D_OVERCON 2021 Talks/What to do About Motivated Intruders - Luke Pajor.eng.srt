1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,919
thank you very much

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,080
so welcome as i said everyone today my

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,040
topic is on

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,920
motivated intruders so

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,520
started

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,800
hello everyone first of all my name's

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,680
luke but

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,000
before i get started on my topic of

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
motivated intruders

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,560
i just want to have a quick shout out to

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,080
the organizers

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,159
and everyone else for turning up thank

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,680
you and of course

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,360
to everyone else who has spoken before

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,200
me you have all delivered some great

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,320
talks

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,480
absolutely brilliant and i've learned so

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,680
much from those

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,120
thank you very much so as i said

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,600
today my topic is on motivated intruders

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,199
so in short why have i chosen to discuss

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,160
motivated intruders with you today it's

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,399
simply because

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,399
whether you may be aware of it or not it

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,520
is not a

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,799
traditionally hot topic er of discussion

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
around security

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,080
plus they are also not given the same

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,439
amount of scrutiny

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,799
examination and observation as insider

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,240
and outsider threats are and i'd also

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,200
just want to bring

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,520
some awareness to the subject matter and

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,040
see what we can do about it

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,159
going forward just some brief points

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,680
first before i get into the meat of the

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,960
topic

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
first off insider threats motivated

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
intruders and outsider threats

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,880
their motivations as they are people

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,200
traditionally speaking i mean a trojan

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
horse doesn't have a motivation

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,759
their motivations do intersect they are

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,680
not too dissimilar

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,759
the results of their actions are also

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,759
quite similar in the sense of they

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,720
compromise data they cause damage among

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
other things

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,719
they while they still have all of this

50
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,360
in common

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,759
they still differ in very significant

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,920
ways which i'm going to take you through

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,200
as the talk progresses

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,598
so anonymization is our first one

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,280
what is an anonymization you may ask

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
in short it is the process of rendering

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,400
data

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,959
into a form which does not identify

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,400
individuals

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,360
and where identification is not likely

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,000
to take

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,400
place we've also got

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,120
pseudo-normalization the first tongue

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
twister of the day so

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
please excuse me if i lose my train of

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,160
thought and get tongue-tied

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,519
pronouncing these words as we go but

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,440
back to the subject what is it

69
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,680
pseudo-nominization

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,879
is the processing of or personal of

71
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,920
personal data

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,239
in such a manner that the data can no

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,519
longer be attributed

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,840
to specific data subjects without the

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,239
use of additional information

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,159
provided of course that additional

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,599
information is kept

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,720
separately and isolated and is subject

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,440
to technical and organizational measures

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,159
to ensure that the personal data is not

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,280
attributed to an

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,560
individual or identifiable natural

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,840
person next definition we've got

84
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,200
and denomination these two terms

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,040
are used interchangeably so what is it

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,239
in short it is described as the process

87
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,799
of analyzing data or combining it with

88
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,680
other data

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,000
with the result that individuals become

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,879
identifiable

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,799
and that course leads us to the

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,599
definition

93
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,959
of a motivated intruder a motivated

94
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,159
intruder

95
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,080
in short is someone who is well

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,280
resourced

97
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,840
and competent and is able to employ

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
investigative techniques

99
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,640
my personal opinion on this of that

100
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
particular definition is that

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,920
well-resourced is a highly open-ended

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,720
term

103
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
to me it can just be someone with a

104
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,280
simple innate curiosity

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,159
and of course has access to the internet

106
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,280
or adverse sources of

107
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,840
information such as libraries etc

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,880
so as i touched upon previously about

109
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,399
the motivations of

110
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,759
these types of attackers or intruders

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,960
why the motivation

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
in short in the case of journalists

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
they're motivated to get their story

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,840
scoop of the century

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,919
or something along those lines and it is

116
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,120
their job to you know

117
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,320
bring data to the forefront

118
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
we also have of course financial

119
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,360
attainment

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,560
or other male efficient reasons

121
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,280
we've got political activism and or

122
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
hacktivism

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,199
this is usually operations against a

124
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,919
organization person or other entity some

125
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,639
grand examples include a hacker group

126
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,680
anonymous

127
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,639
as i'm sure who you're perfectly well

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,080
aware of for

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
hacking and denominating data even

130
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,440
groups

131
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,759
such as greenpeace do partake in such

132
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,039
activities

133
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,560
there is also curiosity what i mean by

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,120
this is

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
just ordinary people like you and me who

136
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,400
just want to see

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,240
what's going on around the neighborhood

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
for instance

139
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,720
so we look around for

140
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,400
crime statistics about what's going on

141
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,080
in our neighborhood

142
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,039
and the closer it is to home the more

143
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,919
likely we're

144
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
going to be able to demonize that

145
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
particular subject because we may know

146
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,520
someone family friend or anyone else who

147
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,960
was involved

148
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,919
in that particular incident there are

149
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,520
also personal motivations

150
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,479
as i've already noted trajan horses

151
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,360
don't have

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
a motivation it's always pushed by a

153
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,880
person

154
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,280
a living being behind that and personal

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,400
motivations

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,719
vary from person to person naturally

157
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,880
so how does this actually work

158
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,919
or what does denomination look like well

159
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,880
let me give you an example here as you

160
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,479
can see

161
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,960
we've got here a news article from

162
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
washington dc

163
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
which is accompanied by a

164
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,039
washington dc hospit based hospital

165
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,960
their hospital reports or records

166
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,120
as you can see in the um as you can see

167
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,199
in the article it's got here a 60 year

168
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,960
old soap lake man

169
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,680
crashed on his motorcycle on saturday

170
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,639
afternoon

171
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,160
and he was allocated to sacred heart

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
hospital now look on the left hand side

173
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
as you can see

174
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,000
you've got the hospital record look at

175
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the sheer amount of data that's been

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
shared you've got the address

177
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,039
and name of the hospital the code length

178
00:06:59,039 --> 00:06:59,680
of stay

179
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,039
the discharge date and of course you've

180
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,520
got his address and age

181
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,240
in america whether you're aware aware of

182
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,360
this or not

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
in 33 states hospitals or that

184
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,840
particular institution

185
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,000
type are obligated to share data with

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,880
governments

187
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,479
and other entities that is alone

188
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,120
is a very terrifying thought about how

189
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
easy it is

190
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,639
to access data because as you can see

191
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,000
from this example it's not just

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
you and your doctor it is you your

193
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,280
doctor

194
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,400
and now everyone else so that brings

195
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,840
me on to my next point of how

196
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,720
do we prevent our data from becoming so

197
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
publicly available in such a

198
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,800
data rich sharing society

199
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,919
so the first thing i want to discuss is

200
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,720
data anonymization techniques or masking

201
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
and its variants

202
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
data masking insured just involves

203
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,000
removing personal identifiers

204
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,520
such as names from a piece of

205
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,919
information to create a data set

206
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,160
in which no personal identifiers are

207
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
present

208
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,759
its variants include partial data

209
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,720
removal

210
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,960
this results in data where some personal

211
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
identifiers

212
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
such as names addresses postcodes

213
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,319
and so on have been removed but other

214
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,680
tidbits of information

215
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,280
such as date of birth remain

216
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,840
we've got data quarantining this is the

217
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,560
technique

218
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,599
of only supplying data to a recipient

219
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,719
who is unlikely or unable to have access

220
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,519
to the other pieces of data that will be

221
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,958
needed to facilitate re-identification

222
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,440
these are all relatively high risk

223
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,440
denomination methods let me give you an

224
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,399
example the electoral roll data

225
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
this of course can be used to

226
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,000
reintroduce names

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
that have been removed to the data set

228
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
fairly easily

229
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
so due to its richness it's very

230
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,040
easy to re-identify sub-data subjects

231
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,399
that now brings us to another technique

232
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,920
known as aggregation and its varying so

233
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,040
what is that data aggregation is

234
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,640
displayed as a total

235
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,000
so no data relating to or identifying

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,120
any individual is shown small numbers in

237
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,839
totals

238
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,000
are often suppressed through a process

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
called blurring

240
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
or by being omitted entirely

241
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,760
that also takes us to cell suppression

242
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,120
so what is cell suppression if data

243
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,399
from a sample survey then it may be

244
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,720
inappropriate to release tabular outputs

245
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,240
with cells which contain

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,640
small numbers of individuals let's say

247
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,000
below 30.

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,839
this is because the sampling error on

249
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,240
such cell estimates would typically be

250
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,279
too large to make the estimates useful

251
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,839
for statistical purposes

252
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
in this case of course suppression of

253
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,279
cells with small numbers though

254
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,760
for quality purposes they act in tandem

255
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,959
with suspicion for disclosure purposes

256
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,480
let's say for an example data

257
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
can be linked to wider geographical

258
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,120
areas where age bands could be expanded

259
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,959
and widened we now move on to inference

260
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,079
control

261
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,640
which is when some cell values let's say

262
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,920
one to five

263
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,839
and statistical data can present a

264
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,480
greater risk of re-identification

265
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,200
this is dependent on the circumstances

266
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,600
so

267
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,560
small numbers can either be suppressed

268
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,040
or

269
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,000
values manipulated which is often

270
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,200
referred to as bernardization

271
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,279
if a large number of cells are affected

272
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,200
then the level of aggregation

273
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
can be changed this also

274
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,880
brings us to perturbation which is

275
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,320
a message sorry a method of disclosure

276
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,880
control

277
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,279
for tables or counts it involves

278
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,839
randomly adding or subtracting

279
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,959
one from certain cells in the table

280
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,440
rounding which is a figure up and down

281
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,160
to disguise precise statistics

282
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,600
let's let me give you an example of that

283
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,200
round in let's say if one table has a

284
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
cell with a value of ten thousand

285
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,560
for all people doing some activity up to

286
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,160
the present date

287
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,000
however let's say the following month

288
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,440
that figure in the cell

289
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,360
rises to one now if an intruder compares

290
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,079
the tables

291
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,040
it would be easy to deduce a cell of one

292
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,839
rounding

293
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,120
prevents this we got

294
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,320
we also have now sampling

295
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,040
in some cases when very large numbers of

296
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,320
records are available

297
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,480
it can be adequate for statistical

298
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,680
purposes

299
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,320
to release a sample of records selected

300
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,720
through

301
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,839
some stated randomized procedure

302
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,720
by not releasing specific details of

303
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,920
this sample

304
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,760
data holders can minimize the risk of

305
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,760
re-identification

306
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,240
synthetic data as well mixing up which

307
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,079
involves mixing up the elements of the

308
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,279
data set

309
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,839
or creating new values entirely which

310
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,600
are based on the original data

311
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,440
so that all all of the overall totals

312
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,040
and values of the set

313
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,360
are preserved but do not relate to any

314
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
particular individual

315
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,880
we also have tabular reporting which is

316
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,200
just in short a means of producing

317
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,760
tabula or aggregated data this protects

318
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,240
against re-identification

319
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,720
now these methods in particular are

320
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,639
relatively low risk

321
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,639
because it's generally difficult to find

322
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,680
anything out

323
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,320
about a particular individual by using

324
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,079
aggregated data

325
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,320
this data does not support individual

326
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,440
level research

327
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,760
but this can be sufficient to analyze

328
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,560
social trends

329
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,880
on a regional basis we also come to

330
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
derived data items abandoned what are

331
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
these

332
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,600
derived data is a set of values that

333
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
reflect the character of

334
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,040
the source data but hide the exact

335
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,880
original values

336
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,040
this is usually done by banding which

337
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,000
produces

338
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,839
coarser grain descriptions of values

339
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,920
than in the source data set

340
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,320
an example of replacing birth dates

341
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,040
birth dates or years addresses by areas

342
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,079
of residence awards

343
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,360
using partial postcodes or rounded exact

344
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,920
figures

345
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,160
so they appear in a normalized form

346
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
this resulting data can be relatively

347
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,399
rich because it can facilitate

348
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,560
individual level research but it

349
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,600
prevents

350
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,120
really low level re-identification risk

351
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
now let's see some examples of these

352
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,839
techniques in action

353
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,120
an example being let's use the

354
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,839
university stephen research center or

355
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,360
usrc's

356
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,360
data study on individuals

357
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
who have been on special assistance

358
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,680
benefit with a certain body mass

359
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,959
index or bmi for short look at

360
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,839
it here you've got their names

361
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
addresses and date of birth

362
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,000
and how long they've been specifically

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,680
on special assistance benefit

364
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,639
and their body mass index of course

365
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,920
followed by

366
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,040
their research cohort reference

367
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,560
now let's say as an example a hospital

368
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,519
or another

369
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
research institution which is to do

370
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,279
conduct a study on people with a certain

371
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,000
bmi

372
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,360
and if they've received benefits or not

373
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,720
this is what the usrc will give them

374
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,000
if they conduct a proper deer

375
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,880
normalization

376
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,920
anonymization sorry process as you can

377
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,399
see

378
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,839
a name address date of birth are being

379
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,959
removed the period of assistance

380
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,920
benefits

381
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,800
has been widened the band so less than

382
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,880
two years greater than five years

383
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,279
but all the necessary data such as the

384
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,160
bmi

385
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,079
age range and research cohort numbers

386
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,199
still there

387
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,480
for the institution to do

388
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,440
a proper study

389
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,560
so that brings me on to my next point

390
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,600
now

391
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,079
enough on techniques how do different

392
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,160
branches of society deal with it

393
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,519
such as let's say the judiciary

394
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,839
the judiciary in short counts as

395
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
motivated intruders

396
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,880
predominantly journalists is their main

397
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,680
thing

398
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,519
we have court orders and judgments that

399
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,959
grant a nominisation

400
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,000
of those involved in a certain case by

401
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,839
invoking the contempt of court act 1981

402
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,959
in brief should a journalist or anyone

403
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,920
else choose to put

404
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,920
make the requested data subjects

405
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,199
publicly available or de-anonymize it

406
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,199
they will be facing at least two years

407
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,758
in prison accompanied by hefty funds

408
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,880
now how do the government deal with it

409
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,560
for this particular talk i've chosen to

410
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
stick to the office of national

411
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,759
statistics as a

412
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,680
as an example the ons because they are

413
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,639
very data rich and data data-heavy usage

414
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,040
part of the government as you know the

415
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,560
demand from users of government

416
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,600
departments has

417
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,480
necessitated data to be more vigorously

418
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,440
assessed

419
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,639
prior to disclosure

420
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,279
they ons themselves have of course

421
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,440
released guidance on the snap cell

422
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,160
and they refer to identifiable data as

423
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,040
micro data

424
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,120
so moving on with that the ons have two

425
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
types

426
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,520
of testing internal and external

427
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,199
let's go through their differences

428
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,119
internal tests are conducted by

429
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,919
volunteers

430
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,079
who are working in the department that

431
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,640
wishes to release the data set

432
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,520
they normally spend about half a day

433
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,919
attempting to do not de-anonymize

434
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,559
data subjects external testing

435
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,000
which is carried out by a separate

436
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,880
organization participants are provided

437
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,720
typically with a list of persons

438
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,280
businesses and are requested to identify

439
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,320
them

440
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,679
and on that note what what defines

441
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
the success of either test well success

442
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
of either test is measured with the

443
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,120
number

444
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
of correct identifications along with

445
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,640
associated confidence percentages which

446
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,679
in short

447
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,039
means how confident the supposed

448
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,400
motivated intruder

449
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,919
feels that they've been able to

450
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,160
re-identify the data subject

451
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,320
so moving on as you can see we've got

452
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,200
four steps for how the rns deal with it

453
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,080
they

454
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,640
basically tabulate the data and variable

455
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,520
combinations

456
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,360
and they look for low counts or

457
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,039
distinctive patterns such as where

458
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,600
non-zero accounts are distributed

459
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,400
among a certain small number of cells in

460
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
rows of columns

461
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,559
if there are unique or rare combinations

462
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,039
in the data they apply disclosure

463
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,520
control

464
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,960
to the problematic variable these can

465
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
include the removal of variables

466
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,760
or records recoded or record swapping

467
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,400
continuing on they tabulate the variable

468
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,520
combinations again

469
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,799
from the protected micro data

470
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,640
if there are no obvious disclosure

471
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
issues then they skip to step four

472
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,799
otherwise step two and

473
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,840
and apply more disclosure control

474
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,679
then they carry out intruder testing if

475
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,360
there are many successful claims and

476
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,880
steps dutiful

477
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,440
will need to be repeated and of course

478
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,080
finally

479
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,320
naturally the published data under the

480
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,080
required license and there are

481
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,918
a variety such as open and restricted

482
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,720
now this brings me to how do

483
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,760
corporations

484
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,240
and other aspects of society deal with

485
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
as you can see let's

486
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,640
go through some examples we've got yahoo

487
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,880
we've got adult friend friend disney

488
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,000
plus

489
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,600
clubhouse linkedin and of course

490
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,039
facebook the perhaps most famous so how

491
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,160
do all of these

492
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,480
businesses deal with motivated intruders

493
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,559
the short answer unfortunately is they

494
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,760
don't deal with it

495
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,200
very well take for instance the yahoo

496
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,080
example

497
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,000
yahoo had a data breach in 2013

498
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,400
where the data of three billion people

499
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,480
was compromised three million three

500
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,360
billion customers i don't know about you

501
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,159
but i've been affiliated with yahoo i've

502
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,480
used their services services and i

503
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,840
imagine everyone else has

504
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,200
as well and they only decided to tell us

505
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,280
this in 2017.

506
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,559
disney plus have denied it clem house

507
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,640
also denied it

508
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,679
so as you can imagine they only deny

509
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,120
these things though

510
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,039
to protect their reputation and business

511
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,880
because emitting weakness

512
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,640
in this respect that you're unable to

513
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,400
keep your customers data safe it's

514
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,120
probably not the greatest idea

515
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,240
but transparency is also called

516
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,360
it's easier said than done because

517
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,039
minus mass surveillance that the

518
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,640
government conducts on us

519
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,320
its citizens anonymization is

520
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,919
key hence why anonymizing data is so

521
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,760
straightforward for them but

522
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,600
in terms of a business like yahoo google

523
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,200
that is their revenue stream

524
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,840
data sharing is what they're built upon

525
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
so anonymizing data is not

526
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,600
in their best interest for the bottom

527
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,840
line

528
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
but that also brings me to the next

529
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
point how did how would they deal with

530
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,600
it well

531
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,799
testing for motivated intruders is

532
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,360
very similar to penetration testing in

533
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,960
certain respects

534
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,600
that a theoretical analysis needs to be

535
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,039
carried out

536
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,600
basically we look at what kind of data

537
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,320
is stored

538
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,440
how it is stored and assessed accessed

539
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,080
and how granular it is

540
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,159
that also then brings us to the

541
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,760
practical analysis test

542
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,840
where we use a mix of skilled and

543
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,159
unskilled testers in an ideal world to

544
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,600
conduct searches

545
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,880
and correlate data to re-identify it

546
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,559
if any of these results take more than

547
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,919
an hour i would probably

548
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,520
say and i'm sure you would all agree

549
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,039
with me it's not worth a

550
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,159
motivated intruder's time because time

551
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,000
with anything is the most precious

552
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,559
resource

553
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,679
so when do we use testing well

554
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,000
when there is empirical evidence of

555
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,799
whether

556
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,960
the data can be published or whether

557
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,320
further protections

558
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,640
is necessary it enables data users to

559
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
understand the overall sensitivity

560
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,840
of a database also this highlights

561
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,799
vulnerabilities

562
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,360
in data specifically variables of

563
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,000
concern

564
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,760
but an intruder target to make a

565
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,280
disclosure consider

566
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,640
removal or re-categorization

567
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,000
and finally this also emphasizes what

568
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
pieces of information

569
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,159
that might be combined with the data for

570
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,520
the identification

571
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,799
this is also known as a mosaic or jigsaw

572
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,679
effect

573
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,120
respectively of course there are also

574
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,559
ethical considerations

575
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,000
to account for when testing

576
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,679
some of these include

577
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,080
including ensuring that as far as

578
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,600
possible intruders will act

579
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,360
in a trustworthy way meaning well

580
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,120
they need security clearance to carry

581
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,720
the tests out and they can be counted on

582
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,840
um also ensuring that intruders are

583
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,520
aware that should they

584
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
release the data or use it in any shape

585
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,559
or form

586
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,159
there will be penalties involved whether

587
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,080
that be hefty fines lawsuits

588
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,120
among another platform of

589
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,240
punishments if that's the right word a

590
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,679
separation of process

591
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,919
between who is analyzing and validating

592
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,720
claims

593
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,240
and who is actually intruding

594
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,480
intruders are also told to not to search

595
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,240
for individuals who are known to the

596
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,080
checkup for example

597
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,120
employees they work with discussion and

598
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,320
consideration of the

599
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,440
geography so that the intruders

600
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,960
have limited chance of inadvertently

601
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,760
re-identifying data

602
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,840
concerning individuals who are known to

603
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,520
them

604
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,760
ensuring that the intruder is not told

605
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,679
also which claims they make are correct

606
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,360
so they do not learn

607
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,840
anything new about identities of

608
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,640
respondents

609
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,400
in the data so what can we do going

610
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,600
forward

611
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,400
well basically we can raise awareness

612
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,799
advise more businesses governments and

613
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,320
other branches of

614
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,320
society that may require a test

615
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,640
and implementing the motivated intruder

616
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,159
test of course and so a risk

617
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,880
assessment will promote best practice as

618
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,440
well

619
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,480
just basically creating the habit we can

620
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,840
also be smarter

621
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,960
about how we conduct data sharing and

622
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,159
i'm sure as is

623
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,840
quite common knowledge of all of the

624
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,159
policies of today do not quite align

625
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,520
with technology

626
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
technology changes faster than policy

627
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,039
naturally

628
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,919
so that also brings us to broader

629
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,960
questions for further discussion

630
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
such as is there a critical point where

631
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,480
data should be

632
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,000
but cannot be anonymized data breaches

633
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,760
such as with the cases of yahoo and

634
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,799
facebook

635
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,799
who is accountable for this and who

636
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,960
takes responsibility

637
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,840
this is why the governments and other

638
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,400
law

639
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,159
institutions struggle to

640
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,240
deal with data breaches because these

641
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,480
companies and their resources are simply

642
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:26,960
so

643
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,360
vast it's going to be difficult to pin

644
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,520
down where exactly they went wrong

645
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,559
as well data scraping as well

646
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,559
is also a perfect opportunity for

647
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,919
motivating intruders

648
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,720
and other types of attackers so what can

649
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
companies and governors do

650
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,279
about that also

651
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,799
there is on a final question in relation

652
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,720
to court orders etc

653
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,520
what do we do about data that is already

654
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,559
de-anonymized

655
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,679
and publicly available because this data

656
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,600
that is can already be linked

657
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,240
to other cases on that final note

658
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,360
here are my contact details my linkedin

659
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,880
and my discord

660
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
it's been a pleasure speaking with you

661
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,120
all today and i hope you have all learnt

662
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,240
something valuable

663
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,440
and new thank you for your time
