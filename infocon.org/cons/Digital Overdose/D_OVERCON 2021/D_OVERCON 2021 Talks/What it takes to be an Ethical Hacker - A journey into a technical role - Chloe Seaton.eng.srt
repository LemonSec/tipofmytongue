1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,000
okay

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
awesome um i'll just go over everything

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,599
that i said just in case people missed

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,000
it

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,360
and if you hear a dog howling in the

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,400
background i'm sorry that's my puppy

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,119
so um hi everyone my name's chloe and

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,720
i'm an ethical hacker i've been doing

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,640
ethical hacking for just over a year and

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,680
a half now

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,199
prior to that i didn't have any

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,880
technical experience i did a degree in

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,560
criminology so something completely

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,199
different

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,960
and i'm relatively new to the cyber

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,400
industry

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,920
i'm really excited to talk to you all

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,360
today about what it takes to be an

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,040
ethical hacker and a journey into a

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,160
technical role

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,680
and just want to say big thanks to

22
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,280
everyone for attending today

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
so giving a nod to my degree i wanted to

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,640
start things off in a very social

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,160
scientist way by looking at the

26
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,280
statistics about

27
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,680
who are the people in cyber what are the

28
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,079
demographics that make up our industry

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,360
in the uk specifically

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
and i found this to be quite tricky i

31
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,559
didn't

32
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
find loads of statistics out there that

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,840
looked at the demographics of the people

34
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,520
that make up the cyber industry in the

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,159
uk

36
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,520
there's quite a lot on women in stem

37
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,000
but not so much about breaking down

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,720
further

39
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,000
granular than that i did find the

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,840
decrypting diversity report

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,799
which was produced in 2020 by the ncsc

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,720
in partnership with kpmg and it's the

43
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,799
first report of its kind to look at

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,680
diversity within the cyber industry and

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,799
it focused on

46
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,960
four areas of diversity so that was

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,799
ethnicity sexual orientation

48
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,040
gender identity and socio-economic

49
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,400
background and for this talk i just

50
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,040
wanted to

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
hone in on the socio-economic background

52
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,840
just because i thought

53
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,399
um it related the best to the content

54
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,399
today

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,759
and this report highlighted target areas

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,439
that i believe in cyber security that we

57
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,759
should all be aware of

58
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,840
and also hopefully it should provide you

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,360
with some food for thought on what types

60
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,799
of people are potentially missing out on

61
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,680
some awesome cyber security careers

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
so i'm not going to go into loads of

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
details so if you wanted to um

64
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,119
go in to the report a little bit more

65
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,080
you can find it on the ncsc website but

66
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,840
the five institute the finder suggests

67
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
that those working

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,000
in um cyber security tend not to come

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,400
from

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
lower socioeconomic backgrounds with a

71
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
greater proportion having attended fee

72
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,040
paying scores within the uk so i thought

73
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,959
this was really interesting

74
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,720
especially from my own experience within

75
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
school but also um

76
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,560
when i became an hacker i started to

77
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,800
do a lot of insight events at schools

78
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,560
just trying to raise awareness about

79
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,959
what i do amongst children but

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,080
especially

81
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,519
amongst teachers because i found that

82
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,760
the children didn't know but maybe even

83
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,599
worse the teachers didn't know

84
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,319
what i did or quite about a lot of

85
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,200
different

86
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,560
um careers that exist within cyber

87
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,640
so i think it's really important that

88
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,599
teachers

89
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,040
children and parents recognize um

90
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,840
the skills that are needed in order to

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,319
enter the cyber industry

92
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,440
and it also gives them more

93
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,519
opportunities regardless of whether they

94
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,040
want to enter the cyber industry on

95
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,720
leaving university or

96
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,840
when they progress into their

97
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,159
professional careers

98
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,519
so i think that came up quite a lot in

99
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,599
my research was a cyber skills gap

100
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,000
within the uk so is there a cyber skills

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
gap

102
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
um so the decrypting diversity report

103
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:25,920
says that the uk

104
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,159
faces a widely documented cyber skills

105
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,120
gap which i think

106
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,599
um you might have seen quite a lot of

107
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,599
the because there's numerous of uh news

108
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,440
outlets that report about cyber skills

109
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
gap within the uk currently

110
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,599
and um digital resilience is becoming

111
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,760
increasingly central to our economic and

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,360
social future which i couldn't agree

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,239
more with

114
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,239
um yet this year alone

115
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,480
the department of digital culture media

116
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,040
and sport found that 653

117
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,239
300 uk businesses have a basic cyber

118
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,920
skills gap

119
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,280
which i thought to be quite astounding

120
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
really

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
so then um exploring this a bit more

122
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
further getting a bit more in depth i

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,439
found this report called disconnected

124
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,959
which was produced by the linen work

125
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,680
institute in partnership with ingenuity

126
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,920
and this explores the digital skills gap

127
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,279
so it's worth noting that this

128
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,040
is talking about a digital skills gap

129
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,959
not specifically cyber but i

130
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,440
think this overlaps um very much so

131
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,479
um and it confirms the importance of

132
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,560
digital skills within the uk

133
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400
uh economy but also helps us to

134
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
understand those supply and demand

135
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,560
issues

136
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,759
between um the points of view of young

137
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,320
people

138
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,520
and employers so um young people are

139
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,000
digital

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
natives that have grown up surrounded by

141
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,199
digital technology which i couldn't

142
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,479
agree more with

143
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,800
um and the majority that's 62 are

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,240
confident that they have the basic

145
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,919
digital skills that employers need

146
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,479
however

147
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,960
fewer than one in five that's 18 of

148
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
young people

149
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
um are very confident that they advance

150
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,919
advanced digital skills that employers

151
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,720
need

152
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,800
so i thought this was really interesting

153
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,759
before i found

154
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,199
found out about ethical hacking i

155
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,479
definitely would have put myself in

156
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,000
there not having confidence with

157
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,479
advanced digital skills category

158
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,639
i didn't for example i didn't know what

159
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,400
coding was i didn't know how to code

160
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,240
that wasn't something that was taught

161
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,560
to me in high school and it was

162
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
something that i kind of just

163
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
picked up when i started doing ethical

164
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,360
hacking

165
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,320
um and i think it's even more important

166
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,759
now that kids are being

167
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,680
immersed more in tech and

168
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,919
increasingly use more and more advanced

169
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,840
tech day-to-day but they're not really

170
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
being taught

171
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,639
what's under the hood of that technology

172
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,840
and schools especially within the uk

173
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,840
not tapping into that potential early on

174
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,600
which brings me on to raising awareness

175
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,520
and harnessing potential so it would be

176
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,960
really great if we could

177
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,000
try and step out of this mentality

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,759
and i believe it starts with schooling

179
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,759
and parental awareness as i said before

180
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,160
so when i joined um ethical hacking this

181
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,919
is when

182
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,440
all of these ideas about raising

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,199
awareness and harnessing potential kind

184
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,520
of

185
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,800
um came to me um because

186
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,520
i'm surrounded daily by some amazing

187
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,120
creative minds that

188
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,720
want to understand the why of what

189
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,479
they're doing all the time and it wasn't

190
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,000
a way of thinking that i was privy

191
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,199
to when i was growing up um and that's

192
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,680
no one's fault um it just wasn't

193
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,600
encouraged within me when i was a kid

194
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
um and it wasn't something that i just

195
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
did like um

196
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,319
quite a lot of people who are in um

197
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,840
technical industries have

198
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,720
and um i think instead of just

199
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
encouraging the thinking about the why

200
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,280
within

201
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,680
chemistry biology and physics the

202
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,199
science behind what you're doing we

203
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,880
should start encouraging it

204
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,160
within tech as well and computer science

205
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
shouldn't just be an option

206
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,960
i think um whether that be making it

207
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,479
compulsory i'm not sure but

208
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,520
definitely um giving kids

209
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,639
more technical skills that are um

210
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,120
necessary to join the cyber industry

211
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
early on

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
even early as primary school so i'll

213
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,479
give you an example of what i'm talking

214
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,599
about this is a very

215
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,440
magnified example but illustrates my

216
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
point nevertheless so this is thomas

217
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,720
suarez i think i'm pronouncing his last

218
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,680
name correctly

219
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,840
but this is him giving a ted talk at 12

220
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,039
years of age

221
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,080
and um he is very into act development

222
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,639
so

223
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,880
and prior to that he was very interested

224
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
in playing games on his

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,240
ipad but he wanted to understand how

226
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,360
these games are working

227
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,039
and how he could create them himself so

228
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,039
he set out developing apps

229
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,199
um and he developed an app called

230
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,120
bestinjiba which is a justin bieber

231
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
whack-a-mole game in response to a lot

232
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,319
of the kids in his school not

233
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,160
particularly liking justin bieber

234
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,759
and he released this just before the

235
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,840
holidays um

236
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,680
and it did really really well so if you

237
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,960
want to check out his ted talk i would

238
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,319
highly recommend it's not that long as

239
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,599
well

240
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,800
and one of the key points that he

241
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,639
touched upon within his ted talk

242
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,280
was that if kids know um if kids want to

243
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,199
play football they go to football club i

244
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:17,919
think he

245
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,400
referred to it as soccer though um and

246
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,759
um

247
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,680
if um kids wanna do arts and crafts or

248
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,759
go to arts and crafts club and there's

249
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,000
um lots of different options out there

250
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,479
but when it came to

251
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,640
tech or app development that he was

252
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
talking about in his case

253
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
uh there wasn't anywhere for kids to go

254
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,159
to start learning these skills which

255
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,799
i just thought is such an easy win and

256
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
it was definitely something that i found

257
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,640
true in my school there wasn't anywhere

258
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
that you could go to start developing

259
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,399
these types of skills and it wasn't

260
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,240
easily accessible it was just something

261
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,040
that you kind of

262
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
have to research within your own time at

263
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,480
home

264
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
so i think we need to be more with

265
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,519
forward thinking

266
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600
um thomas set up his own art club within

267
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,279
his schools and has also done a lot of

268
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,800
campaigns to set up various app

269
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,320
development clubs across

270
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,480
um schools and from uh where he's from

271
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
so it would be great if we could do

272
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,160
something similar so that brings me on

273
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,640
to

274
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,200
my journey and why do i really care

275
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
about all this stuff

276
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,040
so like i said i'm uh non-technical uh

277
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,519
well

278
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,320
non-tech was before um and i studied

279
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
criminology at cardiff university i've

280
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,160
always had a fascination with human

281
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
behavior

282
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,959
which carries through um to this day and

283
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,959
i do various bits of research into cyber

284
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,680
criminology criminality alongside my day

285
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,399
job

286
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,560
um but when i left university i really

287
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
didn't know what to do as much as i

288
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,360
enjoyed my degree

289
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,160
it left me feeling confused about what

290
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,600
the next steps were and i think quite a

291
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,360
lot of people feel like that when they

292
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,800
leave university um and because

293
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,720
i am didn't know what i wanted to do and

294
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,160
there was lots of people around me that

295
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,440
didn't know what they wanted to do and

296
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
they were going full force to their

297
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,160
careers it made me feel

298
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,760
quite unsuccessful um and that i was

299
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,399
missing

300
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,200
missing the boat quite a lot and um

301
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,399
questioned

302
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,800
myself and a lot of things when i left

303
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,040
university so i set out to research all

304
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,560
of the different options out there of

305
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,279
the type of person that i wanted to be

306
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,560
and i came across my employer who were

307
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,399
offering a ethical hacking graduate

308
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,240
scheme to people that had had no

309
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,160
technical experience now i knew stuff

310
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,399
about the cyber threat landscape because

311
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,360
of my degree

312
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
touched upon it in a couple of modules

313
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
but didn't have any of the technical

314
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,680
knowledge

315
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,120
um so i decided to go for it and after

316
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,200
a five-stage interview process i got the

317
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,959
job which was amazing

318
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,839
um but um those opportunities don't come

319
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,800
around so often

320
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
and i know that the opportunity that i

321
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,680
was giving it given was very

322
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,360
few and far between for those that have

323
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
no technical um experience

324
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,399
and also i think i've got

325
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,959
really lucky in as well in some cases

326
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,320
for being in the right place in the

327
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,560
right time they happen to be expanding

328
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,200
that team

329
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,959
in my hometown um and prior to that

330
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,480
i'd never heard of ethical hacking

331
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,800
before and so i'd wish i'd known about

332
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,320
it sooner so that

333
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,440
i could develop those skills um

334
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
and this is why i set about raising

335
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,399
awareness and doing what i'm doing and

336
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,519
giving my talk today

337
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,680
but it hasn't always been a completely

338
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,279
easy ride and

339
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,959
this brings me on to imposter syndrome

340
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,880
and confidence within my job

341
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
and um i've definitely suffered from

342
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
imposter syndrome and confidence

343
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,920
um when coming into the industry and

344
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,680
still sometimes suffer with it from

345
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,399
today but i've learned a lot so i wanted

346
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:42,959
to share

347
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,279
it with you so because i'm not your

348
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,240
usual techie

349
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,200
and because i um haven't really grown up

350
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,079
with a huge fascination about computers

351
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,440
um i kind of

352
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,560
struggled when it came to am i in i am

353
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
am i in the right place and am i the

354
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,320
right person to be doing this job

355
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,399
um and from talking from my colleagues

356
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,399
who have had similar journeys to me

357
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,240
that aren't directly technical i'm i

358
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,079
they have shared that they have had

359
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,560
similar experiences to me

360
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,760
which i thought was really

361
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,880
worth noting and i think

362
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,800
what i've come to learn is that no i'm

363
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,160
not your usual techie

364
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
but i bring a lot of other skills to

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
bear within my job

366
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,959
and if i'm part of diversifying the

367
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,920
industry

368
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,880
so that um it's not just people that

369
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,839
have been

370
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,680
and don't develop their technical skills

371
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,279
their whole life but they've gone out

372
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,360
and done other things outside of that

373
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,880
and they can bring those to the cyber

374
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,330
industry then so be it and um

375
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,560
[Music]

376
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,920
i i'm slowly learning that

377
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,639
i am very much a valued member of my

378
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,120
team

379
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,920
because of my varied skill set not just

380
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,480
being

381
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,040
um a completely technical person which

382
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
is great

383
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,560
so what if somebody wanted to enter

384
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,240
the industry particularly i'm going to

385
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,360
talk about ethical hacking because

386
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
obviously that is what i would do

387
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,959
and what should you be focusing on if

388
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959
you want to upskill within this area so

389
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,160
what i wanted to do

390
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,800
is just talk about the training program

391
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,720
that i was on

392
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,920
um which i believe was around

393
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,000
eight months um and it covered four

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,639
modules now this learning curve was

395
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,040
steep

396
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,120
if you can imagine i had never coded

397
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,839
before and then i had to go on to

398
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,320
building enumeration scripts for linux

399
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,079
operating systems and doing the same in

400
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,839
powershell and all of this stuff so

401
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,639
um it was it was very steep it was

402
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,760
challenging rewarding um and

403
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,000
i'm so glad that i stuck it out and got

404
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,040
and got through it

405
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,079
so first thing networking fundamentals

406
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,320
then went on to web and databases

407
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
linux operating system and windows

408
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,600
operating systems

409
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,839
so networking was just getting those

410
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,040
basics down

411
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,120
understanding the osi model anyone who's

412
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,720
anyone that's in cyber would know what

413
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
the osi model is

414
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,240
but then ip protocols and all of the

415
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,839
different protocols and how they fit

416
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,839
into the osi model so that was

417
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,760
um the first thing that we did then

418
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,440
looking at network

419
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,839
architecture so we had a chance to build

420
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,480
our own

421
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,160
networks um and do various attacks over

422
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,959
the network

423
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,839
for example art poisoning or dhcp

424
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,040
starvation

425
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,959
that sort of stuff which was really fun

426
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,560
then getting a bit more granular

427
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,959
and um me at the time thinking oh my

428
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,720
goodness what is going on doing a bit of

429
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,519
escapee

430
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,240
crafting various um packets for example

431
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
we crafted some icmp

432
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
packets and then did some ping scans

433
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,560
over the network

434
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,680
and then um analyzing different

435
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
network packets using wireshark which

436
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,040
becomes

437
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,399
really handy uh later on

438
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,120
so that was networking very much just

439
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
just getting the basic down

440
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,959
um but all in that wrapper of ethical

441
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,240
hacking so

442
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,079
how can these um protocols be exploited

443
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,000
um they're not built with security in

444
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,279
mind so what can we do with them

445
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,320
moving on to web and databases which i

446
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,240
think was one of the funnest but also

447
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,519
one of the hardest

448
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,120
um so just starting off with back end

449
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,480
servers so

450
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
when you are doing a web application

451
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
test for example

452
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,399
when you see that um a site is hosted on

453
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,160
an apache server

454
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,639
understanding that how can you exploit

455
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,839
that nginx

456
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,440
and same for microsoft i is as well so

457
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,560
understanding those

458
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,199
and we had a chance to do some web

459
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,399
development here

460
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,880
so building websites very basic and

461
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
purposefully

462
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,560
um poorly and designed insecure websites

463
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,399
hosting them on our networks that we had

464
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
previously built and then attacking them

465
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,880
so it was all an incremental

466
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,279
um process where the skills were getting

467
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,240
building on

468
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,519
um more and more and more and

469
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,880
so yeah getting the chance to build our

470
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,959
own websites was awesome

471
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,519
and then um having a look at various

472
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,920
exploitation techniques and i could go

473
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,839
on forever when it comes to that

474
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,839
um and then once understanding how those

475
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,680
exploits work

476
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,320
making sure that we've got that nailed

477
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
we were then allowed to use tools we

478
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,759
weren't allowed to use tools unless we

479
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,279
knew how the exploits work

480
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,240
and that we knew um how the tools

481
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
themselves were working

482
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
and that was really key so um for

483
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,959
example sql map we needed to

484
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,600
prove that we could craft an sql query

485
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,000
um

486
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,320
understand the back-end database behind

487
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,480
it and then we'd have to

488
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,320
prove that we could understand how sql

489
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,160
map was working so that we don't just go

490
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,759
out on a client and start hammering

491
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,720
their

492
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,880
applications or networks the tools that

493
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,160
we have no idea

494
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,720
how they're working so that was web and

495
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,240
databases i'm just going to check in on

496
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,439
the time guys cool

497
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,319
we've got we're on the schedule so

498
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,760
moving on to linux

499
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,359
um just in a nutshell basically

500
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,599
we needed to know once we got on a linux

501
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
box how do you enumerate it

502
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,199
so that came down to looking at um file

503
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:25,839
ownership

504
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,919
file missions cron jobs um how to

505
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,000
um edit cron cron jobs um

506
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,320
and then looking at the password and

507
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,760
shadow files

508
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,000
and um password cracking and then

509
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,360
getting to grips with a different path

510
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,440
so we're cracking tools like hashcat

511
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
and then brute forcing using tools like

512
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,799
hydra

513
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,919
which were really fun um and we used

514
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,000
nmap before because that's kind of your

515
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
ethical hacker's bread and butter is

516
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,320
nmap

517
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,080
and we used that when we were doing

518
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,840
different things for for web

519
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,160
but really getting into nmap really and

520
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,440
understanding all of the

521
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
different scripts that are on there and

522
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,600
stuff like that um

523
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,799
and like i said earlier at the end we

524
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,120
built our own enumeration scripts that

525
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,919
would um

526
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,240
that we could run on a linux box and

527
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,679
pull out those different information

528
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,280
that we wanted

529
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,200
and the last module was windows the one

530
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,280
that i found the hardest the one i still

531
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,480
find hard today and

532
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,240
i'm still working on um is windows

533
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,880
so we started off um just having a

534
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
history of windows where it was where

535
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,280
it's become and then the major exploits

536
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
so i've got a two double blue on there

537
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,320
of course

538
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,039
um and then understanding microsoft

539
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,000
active directory

540
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
what fun um and um

541
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,880
looking at uh different group policies

542
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
and spending a whole lot of time

543
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
applying group policies to things

544
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,799
in active directory and then thought i

545
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,679
was gonna cry

546
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,000
that day um but we got through it and

547
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,280
then moving on

548
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,520
to powershell which oddly enough i

549
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,840
really enjoyed scripting in powershell

550
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,240
built our own enumeration scripts um in

551
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
powershell and then running them on

552
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,640
different

553
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,559
windows boxes and so that was a really

554
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,760
quick um race through of what

555
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,919
the ethical hacking training program

556
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,320
covered but i wanted to give you

557
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,679
um just that overarching um

558
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,400
view so that you could get what i

559
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,799
believe

560
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,160
were the um main points out of that if

561
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
you wanted to to go and start developing

562
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,640
those

563
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,919
those skills so closing up

564
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,480
now um the future i've talked about a

565
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,679
lot of things today

566
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,880
i've talked about um the

567
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,640
industry um my my journey and then

568
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
ethical hacking

569
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,240
um and the journey that i went on there

570
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,919
but i just wanted to take this chance

571
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:52,400
now

572
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,760
to deliver my message as clearly as i

573
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
can

574
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,760
so i believe the cyber industry would

575
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,559
benefit massively from diversifying

576
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,720
and in order to do this we need to raise

577
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,120
awareness of what we do we need to get

578
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,000
out there

579
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,600
and tell people about what we do um

580
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,440
and we need to do this amongst children

581
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,640
but also

582
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,600
just as important teachers and parents

583
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,760
there needs to be a bigger person within

584
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,480
schools

585
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
to inspire children to think about tech

586
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,720
in a way that attempts to understand the

587
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,240
why not just basic usage

588
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,640
we should be moving on from that now and

589
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,360
the way

590
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,840
um and that way we can bring more people

591
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,919
into the industry and tackle this

592
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,640
so-called cyber skills gap early on well

593
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
i'm talking primary school getting them

594
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,559
on raspberry pi's and that just being

595
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,799
a standard thing that we do in primary

596
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,080
schools

597
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,039
and then finally um it would be great to

598
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,400
see more businesses

599
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,880
employ people into technical roles from

600
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,039
non-technical backgrounds very much like

601
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,799
myself and be willing to invest in

602
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,960
people to develop these skills

603
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,440
um because i honestly don't know where i

604
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,240
would have been

605
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,440
today if i hadn't had that opportunity

606
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,960
to become an ethical hacker

607
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,720
so thank you everyone for listening and

608
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,039
sorry about the technical difficulties

609
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,360
um if anyone's got any questions that

610
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,799
would be great those are my social media

611
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,400
handles and thank you so much for

612
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,799
listening

613
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
thank you chloe that was fantastic um we

614
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,799
do have a couple questions for you

615
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,640
uh atomic is muted so i'll go ahead and

616
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,480
get started with the first one

617
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,159
and the first question is what should

618
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,520
schools do to harness

619
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,280
young people's potential um

620
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,320
so i touched upon a few but i think we

621
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,440
need to start off

622
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,600
earlier um so that's in primary school i

623
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,000
believe

624
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,360
that kids have the understanding and

625
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
they have the potential to start

626
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,559
learning this stuff

627
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,080
really early on um so

628
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,720
and making it fun so for example i said

629
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
about raspberry pi's

630
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,480
and i think that maybe even

631
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,559
teachers when they're in teacher

632
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,880
training or something like that

633
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,799
they need to be aware of how important

634
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,480
these skills are as well

635
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,280
so i think that's what we um should be

636
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,720
doing but

637
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,679
i think what we can do in the industry

638
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,679
is is get out there and tell people

639
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,640
about what we do

640
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,520
and if um you know instead of just

641
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,120
saying because i get it so many times i

642
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,240
want people like

643
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,360
well what do you do and i'm like well

644
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,679
i do this and this is really important

645
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,200
and um you know

646
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,240
tell kids about it

647
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,520
so mike would you like to introduce the

648
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,840
second question sure um

649
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
so you've gone a lot about the various

650
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,720
tools you know you've had to learn uh

651
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,919
during your eight month adventure

652
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,120
um i guess we can't call it that way uh

653
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,320
so now that you've gone through those

654
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,559
tools that are a bit of a ground work

655
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,679
uh that are a little bit more

656
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,679
interactive etc uh

657
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
what are the most common tools you would

658
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,760
use now as an ethical hacker

659
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,880
yeah great question um depends on the

660
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,840
engagement

661
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,480
but let's just take um web application

662
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,120
testing

663
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,520
but is very much a tool that we use all

664
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320
the time

665
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,440
um if we're doing an inf test

666
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,640
is nmap so heavily rely on nmap for that

667
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,919
and just makes life so much easier

668
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,919
and yeah um red teaming things like um

669
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,320
nessus or cobalt strike and which are

670
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,400
the ones i didn't mention before so it

671
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,720
very much depends on the um

672
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,039
the engagement that you're on but i

673
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,559
would say burp

674
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,039
is the number one closely followed by

675
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,960
nman

676
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,159
awesome we might have another one

677
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,760
coming in clutch yeah

678
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,960
well you can ask it

679
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,559
okay so i'm just going to ask it i won't

680
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,000
type it out um so do you have any

681
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,919
advice for spying ethical hackers or

682
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,360
women specifically looking to get

683
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,799
started in technology or ethical hacking

684
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,799
yes um i will take this question as what

685
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,960
advice i would give myself

686
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,360
um starting out so

687
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,440
when i was doing the interview process i

688
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,120
remember being like okay

689
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,400
what's coding what is this all about

690
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,799
so start there start getting that

691
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,760
understanding

692
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,440
of um coding and getting comfortable

693
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,200
with that way of thinking because it's

694
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,240
very different

695
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,559
um so that's where i would start if you

696
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,480
haven't had exposure to that already

697
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,000
if you have and then start um

698
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,279
researching um

699
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
different types of resources that can

700
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,799
help you

701
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,520
when it comes to understanding how to

702
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
think like an ethical hacker now

703
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,679
i think if you're a beginner things like

704
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,760
hack the box might be a bit too hard but

705
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,400
it wouldn't

706
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,880
hurt just um looking at different

707
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,279
youtube videos of how to complete

708
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,520
different um exercises that are out

709
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,400
there there's

710
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,559
so many different resources that you can

711
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,840
that you can find

712
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,279
and and i wish that i had um known about

713
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,159

714
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,279

715
