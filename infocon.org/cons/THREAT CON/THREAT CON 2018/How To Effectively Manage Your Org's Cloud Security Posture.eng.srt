1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:09,350
we work for Microsoft in the area of

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,360
cloud security today we are here to talk

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,419
about how to improve an organization's

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,869
cloud security posture so they quickly

5
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:20,330
take you through the agenda for today so

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,820
we will start with introduction to

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,950
computing we will talk about what some

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,410
computing is what are the services that

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,410
it offers and be able to compare how

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,390
security is different in cloud of from

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,250
the on-premise environment and we are

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,950
specifically going to talk about certain

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,550
areas like identity access control data

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:42,550
security monitoring within cloud and for

15
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,930
each of these areas we are going to see

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,480
some of the practical scenarios their

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,579
customers faced in the journey to the

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,379
club and we will follow it up with

19
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:53,600
potential solutions to address each of

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,980
these challenges and we are going to

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,829
talk about what is the best mist

22
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,898
solution for the customers to quickly

23
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,940
you know to these new and emerging

24
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,710
challenges in the cloud and we have a

25
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,689
dedicated time for Q&A towards the end

26
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,939
but in case you guys have any questions

27
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:10,460
where you want to stop us before we move

28
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:13,990
to the next slide simply raise your hand

29
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:17,960
and we'll be there Oh what do you

30
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:20,929
so just to do a quick survey how many of

31
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:25,068
you walk on cloud technologies on a day

32
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:30,139
to day to day basis by show of hands

33
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:31,819
please okay a couple of you I expand the

34
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:33,949
audience a little bit more how many of

35
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:35,479
you are familiar with cloud technology

36
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,909
you've not worked with it directly but

37
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:44,060
you're familiar with what that 90 so

38
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:46,700
okay that's great so let me give you an

39
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,859
example say me and a couple of my

40
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,429
friends we got together and started an

41
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:54,740
e-commerce startup and as part of that

42
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:57,079
they're setting up was an application

43
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:01,929
server and right now it's working out of

44
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:03,908
my garage just as a desktop now I start

45
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:06,820
getting a lot of custom

46
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:09,429
and I need to scale the size of my

47
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,910
application with the server and so what

48
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,980
do I do

49
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,500
I can scale it up to say maybe adding a

50
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,399
couple more servers still managing my

51
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:21,459
own infrastructure but as I as I go

52
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,370
forward my company takes off and that

53
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,900
means I need to scale up there were

54
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,630
multiple there are couple of options

55
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,930
here one option would be I go ahead and

56
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:34,600
buy more infrastructure manage it on my

57
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,720
own and take care of all the costs the

58
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,799
lugger could be I just rented from a

59
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,950
third-party provider

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,620
he takes owners of everything from the

61
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,010
maintenance costs making sure it's up

62
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:52,239
and running and things like that so

63
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:54,069
simply speaking cloud computing is my

64
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,680
third party will deliver on-demand

65
00:02:54,069 --> 00:03:03,640
resources on a pay as you use basis why

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,930
do customers moves to the cloud as I

67
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,320
mentioned its on-demand

68
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,269
and then is the matter of a self-service

69
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,220
portal so the cloud solution provider

70
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,980
will give you a sense of a portal and

71
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,140
you can just go and just a few button

72
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,320
ticks provision and configure all these

73
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:23,410
resources the second would be cost so

74
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,470
I'm reducing the amount of money I spend

75
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,870
on electricity making sure the servers

76
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,390
are cool making sure that are up and

77
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,350
running the IT admin cost etc I'm

78
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:38,170
loosing all those costs the third one

79
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,720
would be depending on my needs so let's

80
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,059
say my e-commerce site is seeing of

81
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,739
massive boom because it's new yours and

82
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,829
people are buying a lot of gifts to send

83
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,329
to each other and now add this for the

84
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,050
steady short period of time I can just

85
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,780
increase the number of instead

86
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,730
to scale up or improve increase the

87
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,370
amount of compute that my system has

88
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,440
which is a scaled up just for that

89
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,700
period of time and I will pay some extra

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,560
money just for like those two three

91
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,489
weeks around New Year's and then I can

92
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,070
scale back down the top the fourth one

93
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,990
would be performance when we say

94
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,630
performance that's actually referring to

95
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,310
the cloud solution providers ensuring

96
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,769
that you have the latest in the greatest

97
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,500
hardware running on the cloud

98
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,480
infrastructure so you don't have to

99
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,670
worry about upgrading and updating those

100
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,280
the last one is reliability

101
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:32,270
what is reliability me so reliability

102
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,309
refers to the SLA based availability

103
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,020
which means the cloud solution provider

104
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,410
is actually guaranteeing a certain

105
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,990
amount of uptime and they will back this

106
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,670
guarantee and in some cases it's

107
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:49,520
financially back and you can claim that

108
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:50,630
this is well before we start some of you

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,849
might be familiar with some of these

110
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,650
terms but let's just go over these one

111
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,060
time so that we're all on the same page

112
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,159
because we will be repeating these terms

113
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,540
over and over during the course of our

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,220
session what do I mean by optimize

115
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,710
anything that means my friends was in my

116
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,240
garage or maybe in another room or

117
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,820
another building but that's owned and

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,190
taking care of by us that are the

119
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,280
structure what is a cloud solution

120
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,990
provider or cloud vendors we will use

121
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,049
these terms interchangeably so that's

122
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,840
any third party that could be Google

123
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,140
could be AWS could be IBM could be

124
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,789
Microsoft and they are going to own the

125
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,490
cloud infrastructure that we're talking

126
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,990
about the third one is public cloud in

127
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,910
the key thing that you need to remember

128
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,480
about the concept of public cloud is

129
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:42,650
that you can connect to the cloud over

130
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,669
the Internet the fourth one is cloud

131
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,469
customers so cloud customers would be

132
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:51,229
companies like the example I give my

133
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:54,650
e-commerce site or could be any of your

134
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:58,990
companies that will adopt the cloud this

135
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:01,060
last one is resources so resources

136
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,340
Sothis any web applications and in

137
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:07,050
observer database that you configure in

138
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:11,619
provision on the cloud that's a resource

139
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:13,600
in terms of subscription so subscription

140
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:18,340
I always familiar with Bigwater cloud

141
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,620
subscription means show of hands okay so

142
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,049
I just quickly run through all that when

143
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,750
I go to a cloud solution provider asking

144
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,420
him for their cloud services they will

145
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,210
provide me a subscription which can be

146
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,120
accessed through an online portal cloud

147
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,620
management portal you can call it and

148
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,020
that subscription gets mapped to a

149
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,480
certain login ID and password so those

150
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,830
credentials are what I will use to log

151
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,500
into the cloud management portal and

152
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,599
access my subscription my subscription

153
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,460
is the boundary within which I will have

154
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,440
to configure all these resources any

155
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,270
when I said he saw says all the cloud

156
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,610
services that you provision will be

157
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,289
within that subscription some cloud

158
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,700
providers also give you the capability

159
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:02,920
to segregate the resources that you set

160
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,349
up for production environment as well as

161
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,540
Devon text because let's say I would

162
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,100
have a different kind of access control

163
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,380
and management before the production

164
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,460
environment for them and test I will

165
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:17,860
just let everybody do whatever they want

166
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,450
for the session they will consider a

167
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,730
fictional insurance company called

168
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,190
iseman insurance and let's take a look

169
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:28,290
at what their cloud adoption journeys

170
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,290
with that like and some of the choice

171
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,799
[Applause]

172
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:38,780
so let's talk about scenario number one

173
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,440
now iseman insurance is a company with

174
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,330
about 50,000 employees and currently

175
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,120
they are looking at migrating their

176
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,520
payroll application to the cloud now all

177
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,260
of these employees has to access that

178
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,060
payroll application right so the app

179
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,969
development theme for the payroll

180
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,190
application comes back and asks how

181
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,860
should I be authenticating these all

182
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,820
these 50,000 users on the club because

183
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,950
as it stands today I am using something

184
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,680
called something called a compromised

185
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,260
directory service say for example Active

186
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,470
Directory to use the copper credentials

187
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,890
for my 50,000 employees to log into this

188
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,960
application now when I move this entire

189
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,580
infrastructure to the cloud how should i

190
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,969
authenticate so let's take a look at

191
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,190
that this is one of the very initial

192
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,470
problems that most of the customers face

193
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,599
when they decide to move the

194
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,040
infrastructure to the cloud right let's

195
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,990
say you start a company that does not

196
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,459
have any infrastructure in compromisable

197
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,409
because you have just started the

198
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,570
company for them it's easy to start

199
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,280
their journey directly the clock create

200
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,320
your identities in the club so when I

201
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,480
say identities I mean your employees

202
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,920
user IDs and passwords and all the

203
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,320
details about your employees which you

204
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,540
can later on use permit litigation as

205
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,280
well like so if everything stays in the

206
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,680
cloud so identities as well as the

207
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,240
applications you can simply leverage the

208
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,729
identity solution which is in the cloud

209
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,240
and you know let your users log into the

210
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,670
applications in a secure way but if you

211
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,400
are a traditional company or if you are

212
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,050
an established enterprise who has

213
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,699
already invested a lot of amount in the

214
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,579
on-premise infrastructure and in your

215
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,560
own private data centers for you to move

216
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,390
the cloud you will have to first figure

217
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,550
out the problem of identity how do you

218
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,680
manage the identities because all of

219
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,540
your infrastructure or the identity

220
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,640
matrix the identity solutions are in the

221
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,530
unpromising etwork and now we move one

222
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,120
of the eigen applications and hosted in

223
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,220
the cloud how do you log into that

224
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,360
application because my authentication

225
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,460
server and the deed

226
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,980
are in the entremets work so this is the

227
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,290
problem the most of the companies

228
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,020
initially phase so let's take a step

229
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,959
back and talk about how on provides

230
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,850
authentication works and then we can you

231
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,540
know figure out how we can have an

232
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,310
equivalent solution in the club so we

233
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,290
all access applications within our

234
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:00,439
office network or the private network

235
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,630
and we are able to log into this

236
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,070
application seamlessly so have you ever

237
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:09,110
thought about how this authentication

238
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:10,730
works and even how does somebody log

239
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,400
into applications or for that matter

240
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:16,040
let's say how does someone or an

241
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,870
employee log into his workstation when

242
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,969
he is in office what is the

243
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:25,510
authentication that happens in the

244
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:34,070
bathroom anyone you can take a guess

245
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:36,170
it's okay okay so what happens in most

246
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,870
of the unpromising network scenarios is

247
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,270
that you have a directory service which

248
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,890
is most often an active directory which

249
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,199
will hold all the information about your

250
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,510
employees starting from the user IDs to

251
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,490
their passwords to their designations to

252
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,640
their email ids to their phone numbers

253
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,339
everything is maintained in one single

254
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,939
server which is called as a directory

255
00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:00,950
service and when you whenever you try to

256
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,529
log into your machines or access

257
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,660
applications you try to enter the

258
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:08,140
corporate credentials and these

259
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,250
credentials are validated against the

260
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,140
identity server which is in the same

261
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,089
network the crucial point here is that

262
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,500
because it's in the same network I can

263
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:19,880
manage this authentication process

264
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:23,150
seamlessly and through leveraging this

265
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,939
sort of an identity model from several

266
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,490
years we were able to provide secure

267
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,980
reliable robust solutions within the

268
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,440
on-premise network but the apprehension

269
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,990
is that if I go to cloud which I get

270
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,690
included security in the club with maybe

271
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,940
any security challenges for me or get my

272
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,610
employees do my employees now need to

273
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,320
enter new credentials in order

274
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,779
as the cloud applications that's the

275
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,870
primary concern so we have a couple of

276
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:51,700
solutions to address this problem

277
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:54,160
let's talk about the first one which is

278
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,560
going to manage the identity solution so

279
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,300
what happens in this is that you create

280
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,869
another directory service in the ground

281
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,310
and you synchronize all of your details

282
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,740
which are present in the content

283
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:10,899
directory or the active directory into

284
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:12,700
the clock so once this happens you know

285
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:14,500
all the details including the password

286
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,170
hashes of the employees will move into

287
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,170
the club and once directory service in

288
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:23,800
the cloud is aware of all the details

289
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:25,329
you can directly leverage the directory

290
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,740
service in the club in order to

291
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,089
authenticate your employees you don't

292
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,860
have to talk to the pontiff Active

293
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:31,269
Directory as such because both the

294
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,720
applications and identities are in the

295
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:36,490
same space whereas the other solution

296
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,339
which is called the federated identity

297
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,450
model for some reason let's say you

298
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,420
don't want to move your employee

299
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,800
password hashes out set up your network

300
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,930
what is the solution that we have it's

301
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,880
the federated model so the federated

302
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,949
model what happens is you have to

303
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,920
initially set up a Federation service

304
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:56,140
within your on-premise network so this

305
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,029
will be an internet facing server which

306
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,269
means anyone come into it can come and

307
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:03,100
talk to it and at the same time you will

308
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:07,360
create a directory service within the

309
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,680
club experience as you can see even here

310
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,050
we are going to create a directory

311
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,849
service but this directory service will

312
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,459
not have any information about your

313
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,579
employees password hashes it will just

314
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:21,099
know the user details meaning it will

315
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:24,910
have information on the list of users

316
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,320
but it doesn't have password hashes but

317
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,240
what we are going to do is we will

318
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,920
establish a Federation trust between

319
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,060
both the entré minds as well as the

320
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,099
cloud directory services and now let's

321
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,079
think of a situation where the employee

322
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,269
is trying to login to that he endorses

323
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,339
corporate credentials initially the

324
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:44,890
application redirects back to the

325
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,089
Federation server because the Federation

326
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,730
server can talk to the Active Directory

327
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:50,780
can validate the credentials if those

328
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,870
credentials are money it will issue a

329
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:56,030
okay and the pokin will be carried back

330
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,590
to the application and then it will be

331
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,319
given to the directory service in the

332
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,790
cloud but how does my directory service

333
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,940
in the cloud know whether it is a valid

334
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,829
token or not because this token has been

335
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,170
issued by a different directory sitting

336
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,030
somewhere in the on-premise network in

337
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,280
knows that it's a valid token or not

338
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,230
because there is a Federation trust the

339
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,930
DS established between them which means

340
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,910
if I sign a particular token and they

341
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,620
show it the other server can determine

342
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,170
whether it is signed by me and whether

343
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,330
it is valid or not so this way without

344
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,040
moving and going password hashes of the

345
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,010
view Network you can still achieve

346
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:35,260
equivalent authentication if you want to

347
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:37,490
log your users into the applications and

348
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,040
if you combine both of these solutions

349
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,990
it's up to the enterprises to determine

350
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,969
which one works best for them

351
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,030
but the first one the managed identity

352
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,590
solution has less maintenance because

353
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,600
once you sync your details into the

354
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,280
cloud you don't have to maintain any

355
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,250
extra infrastructure in your own one

356
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,970
device so it's sort of imple and also

357
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:01,070
simple is easy to maintain whereas the

358
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,540
federated model because you are hosting

359
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,430
your own Federation server in your

360
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,319
network you will have to ensure that it

361
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,750
has high availability at all points of

362
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,910
time because remember that if your

363
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,040
Federation server is down for some

364
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,240
reason it means that your employees will

365
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,040
not be able to sign into these

366
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,780
applications whereas in the cloud

367
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,459
scenario your cloud provider will give

368
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,290
you assurance that it will be available

369
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,630
for ninety nine or ten point nine

370
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,370
percent of the time in the last point of

371
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,750
compulsion is the password so if you

372
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,150
have any such security compliance

373
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,620
reasons because of which you will not be

374
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,600
able to move this information out of

375
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,450
your network in that case Federation

376
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,910
server will be the best solution with

377
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:41,630
that let's move different problem that

378
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:45,199
iseman is now faced so now we understand

379
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:47,960
how can I smell manage the identities so

380
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,270
with after this the there are multiple

381
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,940
teams within iseman insurance that

382
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:56,210
decide to go ahead and migrate to the

383
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:59,850
cloud so as you can see there's multiple

384
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:01,320
applications and all these application

385
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,410
are going ahead and provisioning the

386
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,780
resources in that cloud subscription

387
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,370
what happens now so at some point in

388
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,920
time you will start having a lot of

389
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,690
databases you have a products in API

390
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,300
servers you'll have a lot of web servers

391
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:19,770
and all that might just become a lot of

392
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:22,439
confusion now the idea even for iseman

393
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:25,290
insurance has a challenge and they want

394
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,030
to figure out who's who can identify who

395
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,310
is the person that's creating these

396
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,990
resources who has access to these

397
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,079
resources and who's doing what with

398
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:37,130
these resources so let's talk about how

399
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,130
they're going to solve this problem

400
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,550
so this translates to the problem of

401
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:47,190
access control in the cloud with cloud

402
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,079
granting access to someone to control

403
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,640
the resource is pretty simple we just

404
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,560
log in to the portal click few buttons

405
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,470
you will have the permission at all you

406
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,839
will be able to give the permission so

407
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,120
it's not only about giving the

408
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,830
permission it is also about

409
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,540
understanding what are different levels

410
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,150
of access controls that somebody can

411
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,490
have in a closed for instance I can have

412
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,189
access and a resource limit meaning

413
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:14,209
maybe to control the database or maybe

414
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:17,850
to deploy an application or maybe to

415
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:21,300
read data within my database and you can

416
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:21,869
also have access and this source

417
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,790
replevin

418
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:25,708
what is the resource group in club it's

419
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,480
pretty simple to understand you group

420
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,640
bunch of resources into one group that

421
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,470
becomes a resource group so Iceman's

422
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,750
payroll team for instance can group all

423
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,050
of their resources and they can have

424
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:39,120
solid payroll resource groups all my

425
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,820
infrastructure will be in one logical do

426
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,110
so somebody can have access and the

427
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,919
resource group level which makes you

428
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,169
will be able to control all the

429
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,900
resources under it the last one is the

430
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,820
subscription level as separately

431
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,890
mentioned in the initial slides

432
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:56,909
subscription is the boundary in the club

433
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,530
so everything is within the subscription

434
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,570
including the resources and the resource

435
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,490
news so if somebody has accessed a

436
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,010
subscription level is going to control

437
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,170
everything starting from a resource to

438
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,050
all the resource groups so those are

439
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,600
different levels

440
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,730
is that somebody can have so Before we

441
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,560
jump into the solution we need to

442
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,650
understand a concept called our buck

443
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,200
because cloud providers extensively

444
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:23,620
leverage the are back model in order to

445
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,260
solve the problem of access control what

446
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:29,850
is our back our back is a loan based

447
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:32,860
access control model which is used to

448
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:36,459
perform certain authorization mechanism

449
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,050
our back is not new to you know computer

450
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,590
security it has been there for quite

451
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,990
some time

452
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:47,459
we are only leveraging the concept in

453
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:50,110
cloud so all that is all about giving

454
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,240
authorization or giving the access at a

455
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,449
very fine-grained level so what does

456
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,220
fine-grained exactly mean it means that

457
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:01,000
you are going to give the permission to

458
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,110
a particular employee the minimum level

459
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,570
of permission that he needs to

460
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:08,199
accomplish a task for instance let's say

461
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:12,070
I am in an administrator team and my job

462
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,110
is to access the logs and you know move

463
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,879
them to a different location so my

464
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,800
permission should only be at the logs

465
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,690
level to read the logs it should not be

466
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,220
at the entire data base level where they

467
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,100
can connect to the database read the

468
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,920
data or you know I had some details to

469
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,510
the difference there are three things

470
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,010
important concept within our back that

471
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,830
we need to understand the first thing is

472
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:34,750
the concept of a role so any action that

473
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,300
you perform on a resource he's sort of a

474
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,550
privilege that you have let's say you

475
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,710
connect to database to read so we have a

476
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,659
read access you connect to database to

477
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:47,230
write data to it remember write access

478
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,940
so whole is basically you know a set of

479
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,400
privileges that somebody has on a

480
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,950
particular resource the second thing is

481
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,410
the scope as we discussed in point

482
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,650
number two about the boundaries we need

483
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:01,390
to have a scope for the access you can

484
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,460
be a reader but can you read all the

485
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,930
databases in your resource close can you

486
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,900
read all the databases in your

487
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:10,090
subscription no so scope is all about

488
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,520
defining what is the access control

489
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,470
boundary field and the third thing is

490
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,889
the role assignment remember all our

491
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,230
identities are now in the club and you

492
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,549
cloud knows the list of users

493
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,990
that are going to login to the

494
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:25,110
applications are going to access the

495
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,480
resources so once we have identities and

496
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:31,590
roles set up in the club access control

497
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,990
in cloud simply reduces to the activity

498
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,879
of assigning roles to these identities I

499
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,100
don't have to go and give special

500
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,840
privileges to everyone I can just map

501
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,189
these rules in if I want to revoke and

502
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,080
access I can just simply remove the

503
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:47,220
rules

504
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:50,820
it's lit so let's look at our back works

505
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,220
in real time let us say a particular

506
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:57,178
user has issued a request couple of

507
00:20:53,220 --> 00:21:00,090
requests one to a particular database to

508
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:02,490
read the data and due to a different

509
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,668
database to delete the data what are the

510
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:07,559
list of things that cloud and we're not

511
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:09,299
with us before executing this the first

512
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,549
thing it verifies what is this guy's

513
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,740
role thus he's trying to read a

514
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:15,900
particular column from the data so does

515
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,910
he have the reader room second thing it

516
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,440
tries to determine what is the role what

517
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,990
is the scope of this particular person

518
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,429
he might have read access but he but

519
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,320
does he have access to read this

520
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:28,020
particular resource it determines the

521
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,030
scope once these two undetermined it's a

522
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,220
matter of faith alone access or denying

523
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,379
glasses in the first case let's say the

524
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,809
user has legitimate access to that

525
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,549
database it will be processed if it is

526
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:40,410
in the second case made he's trying to

527
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:42,150
give it someone else's database the

528
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,600
access will not be provide it will be

529
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:47,640
simply denied so let's quickly talk

530
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,480
about key things to remember in terms of

531
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,669
access control so understand what kind

532
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,770
of access control features your provider

533
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:57,720
offers because not every cloud provider

534
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,120
is going to offer the same level of

535
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,280
access control mechanisms second things

536
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,469
are back is only an offering by the

537
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,870
cloud provider it will not be of any use

538
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,059
until the customer actually spend some

539
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,189
time to figure out what is the level of

540
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,540
access that I need to give what is the

541
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,460
minimum level of access that my

542
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,200
employees need and accordingly going

543
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,540
back through so the bonus is also on

544
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,700
customer to do that effort and

545
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,350
accordingly about these rules and the

546
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,940
third thing is the case of privileged

547
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,699
account so privileged accounts on those

548
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:31,020
accounts which have you know access to

549
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,560
highly sensitive environment or any risk

550
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,120
and

551
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,190
where you are gathering lots of

552
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,189
sensitive data for these sort of

553
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,830
administrative access make sure that you

554
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,510
track this separately to see what is the

555
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,490
kind of access these people have and do

556
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,220
they really require it and on a periodic

557
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,740
basis you need to revise and see if

558
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,030
their access is justified and the last

559
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,670
interesting thing is about the

560
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:56,280
just-in-time access you can think of

561
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,530
this concept as similar to the web

562
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,080
application you know cooking validity

563
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:03,060
sort of thing where once you log into an

564
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,860
application you will be given a cookie

565
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,290
which means I need only for a certain

566
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,629
period of time the same concept is being

567
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,580
applied in terms of administrative

568
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,500
actions let's say I need to connect to a

569
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,020
remote server to do some administrative

570
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,570
function I will have the privilege to

571
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,570
know this only for let's say fires or

572
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,580
radars and after the expiration of that

573
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,740
time my axis will be automatically

574
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:29,159
revoked so with this we are going to

575
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,540
limit the exposure of privilege so even

576
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,030
if an attacker gets access to my

577
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,710
credentials out of this privilege time

578
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:38,040
he will still not be able to connect to

579
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:43,050
my resource to do any of the harmful

580
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:47,550
things so just before we move on to the

581
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:50,300
third one I'm guys following many

582
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:54,240
questions still awake

583
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:56,700
okay so now we've looked at what are the

584
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,100
identity problems that and how they

585
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,370
overcame them we looked at how they can

586
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,260
manage the access control problem now

587
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,850
iseman has to look at a different

588
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,660
problem they are worried about the data

589
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,760
security

590
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,290
so as I'm passing mention rat in the

591
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,420
beginning there an insurance company

592
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,820
right what is it what insurance

593
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:18,000
companies do you find claims with them

594
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,429
and so as part of those claims their

595
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,280
customers will disclose different kinds

596
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:25,360
of sensitive data things like medical

597
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,870
history things like family is medical

598
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,260
things like payment information could be

599
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:34,899
Social Security numbers and now they

600
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,780
want to make sure that they can secure

601
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,700
this data so their privacy analyst comes

602
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,190
up with the question that we have all of

603
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,980
these sensitive information stored in

604
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,290
our databases how can we make sure that

605
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,570
the cloud solution provider cannot read

606
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:51,159
things how can we make sure that if

607
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,929
there is an investigative agency that

608
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,750
comes to the cloud solution provider

609
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:59,110
even then they can't read the data that

610
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:03,100
we have all for instance for some reason

611
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:05,500
if there is a data breach with the cloud

612
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,050
provider that I am storing my data with

613
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,740
even then I don't want the hackers to

614
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:18,940
get my get to my data so what do I do

615
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:21,070
let's take a look perhaps this is one of

616
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,870
the most controversial and most debated

617
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,540
topics when it comes to the cloud like

618
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:29,830
what happens to my data and is my data

619
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:32,290
secure in cloud so we all know that the

620
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:34,120
problem to data security the solution to

621
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,830
the data security problem is to store

622
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,000
the information in an encrypted fashion

623
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:42,490
right and new cloud vendors encrypt the

624
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,680
data and they store it in the cloud of

625
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,270
course all of them do then what do you

626
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,950
think is the problem when the data is

627
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,820
already being encrypted and stored in

628
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:54,340
the club what is the problem

629
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:55,960
so with any encryption it finally was

630
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,000
down to the question of who is holding

631
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,230
the key because whoever holds the key

632
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,690
will be able to make it the information

633
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,420
if he has the encrypted text in his

634
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,340
control so most of the offerings that

635
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,080
cloud windows by default have those

636
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:12,490
where they encrypt the data and the key

637
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:15,879
also stays with the cloud provider so we

638
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:17,560
need smelly secure mechanisms to solve

639
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,880
this problem of key storage and key

640
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,340
access and how does this whole thing

641
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,510
work so we are going to talk about

642
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,350
something called hardware security

643
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:30,670
modules or HSMs as we call so

644
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:32,750
HSR crypto processors which can store

645
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:35,390
keys

646
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,610
and the main important point when it

647
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:40,010
comes to HSM is that once you place a

648
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,689
key in a hitch isms you will not be able

649
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,970
to extract the key outside of the hedges

650
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,130
not even the owner will be able to

651
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,200
extract the key outside the edges but

652
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,870
then what will hedges him do it it can

653
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,740
perform cryptographic operations meaning

654
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:56,899
you can send data to HSN it can use the

655
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,360
key which is present inside the HSM and

656
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,250
give you the encrypted textbook or you

657
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,110
can send the encrypted text to the HSM

658
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,850
it can decrypt it for you and give you

659
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,559
the plaintext back but the key never

660
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,740
leaves the system the key is always

661
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,928
inside so that's one thing to understand

662
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,820
and the second important thing or the

663
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:16,309
concept to understand here is something

664
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,320
going to bring your own key I think most

665
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:20,649
of you might have heard about this so

666
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,270
bring your own key is an offering where

667
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:25,909
you can bring your own keys into the

668
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,559
club and you can encrypt or you can use

669
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:29,929
those keys to encrypt the data that we

670
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,789
stole in the club so together with these

671
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:34,100
two concepts we will be able to solve

672
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:36,230
the problem of data security and let's

673
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,428
see how let's go back to the same

674
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:41,659
scenario to the estimate iseman

675
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:44,240
customers enduring sensitive information

676
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:46,400
like medical information for instance so

677
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,890
once they enter the medical information

678
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,620
it will reach the insurance application

679
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:53,330
and insurance application then needs to

680
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,580
figure out what are these sensitive

681
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,500
fields that need to encrypt and those

682
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,199
fields directly flow into the hardware

683
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,929
security module and the HSM will then

684
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,090
encrypted and sent back the encrypted

685
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:07,880
text remember that the key is still in

686
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:09,350
HSN nobody has access to it we send the

687
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,450
plain text when we got the encrypted

688
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,639
text which can now go into directly in

689
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,919
the clock so everything that's in the

690
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:20,120
cloud is encrypted with the key which is

691
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:22,220
in my control so the westin the best

692
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,168
part of this whole thing is that you can

693
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,299
save or you can create these each

694
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:28,400
essence within your on-premise network

695
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:30,860
or you can create them within the club

696
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,390
so if you are already having a chasm

697
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,820
which you are using in an optimized

698
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:37,549
Network you can simply extend it into

699
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,678
the club or use any of the keys are

700
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:42,530
wasted any of the cloud provider offers

701
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,230
so don't be confused because even if the

702
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,510
cloud provider in

703
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:48,309
is offering it in Chisholm because of

704
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,590
the very nature of the concept of the

705
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:53,889
concept of HSN he will not be able to

706
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:55,720
gain access to the case let us quickly

707
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,660
go through the things important things

708
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,850
to remember first one is that although

709
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:03,789
your data is stored in club you can

710
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,740
still retain your control using your own

711
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:08,200
key and using the concept of hardware

712
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:11,169
security modules and not just encryption

713
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,240
keys you can identify all of the secrets

714
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:16,179
that your application uses for instance

715
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,880
like database connection strings or API

716
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:21,340
keys or even the certificates that you

717
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,289
use for authentication purposes all of

718
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,809
these can be moved to one single case

719
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:28,990
stone or a key store which is backed by

720
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:31,480
HSN the third thing is the system should

721
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,580
not be accessed directly by any of the

722
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,830
employees or any of the users because

723
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,168
there is no reason to do so unless you

724
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,850
have some complex business case so there

725
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:42,570
should only be programmatic access to

726
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:45,969
access to read or to use these

727
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:48,250
intercepts and remember case cannot be

728
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,620
extracted out of HSMs but that doesn't

729
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,990
mean they cannot be deleted so if I can

730
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,789
delete a key which is placed in HSM then

731
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,980
all of your data which is encrypted in

732
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:58,840
the cloud becomes junk because without

733
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,090
the key I won't be able to decrypt it

734
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,668
like so make sure that you have very

735
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,610
tight policies around who can control

736
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:08,590
these key stores and who can update or

737
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,709
delete the keys within these key stores

738
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:15,100
and the last thing is once you you start

739
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,990
using these clouds hosted key services

740
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,610
you also get other benefits like now

741
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,070
that you have all of your keys at one

742
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,990
single place you can define key rotation

743
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:25,059
policies on top of it you can have

744
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,309
proper versioning system for it you can

745
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:29,470
read the access logs of respect to each

746
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:31,928
of these key stores so make sure that

747
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,390
you leverage all of these features when

748
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:37,980
you are using any of the key source so

749
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:41,020
that it's more different on top so

750
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:43,600
that's great now they have decided that

751
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:47,408
they want to move all their applications

752
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:51,730
to the cloud but because of the nature

753
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:53,530
of the size of data they have a sales

754
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,960
and marketing application

755
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,660
and there is a really large amount of

756
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,640
data in the sales database so at one

757
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,380
point they have migrated all other

758
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,740
infrastructure except for the sales

759
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:09,340
database from on-premise and the network

760
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:12,040
admin wants to make sure that the

761
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,620
on-premise data organized resources or

762
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:18,240
the database should be able to securely

763
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:21,310
connect with the database as well as the

764
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,920
API servers the live application that's

765
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:26,590
hosted in the cloud and so we want to

766
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,310
find out how can we securely make that

767
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:34,209
connection

768
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:39,040
let's take a look at that and yeah thank

769
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:41,320
you so my grating IT systems is not an

770
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:44,020
easy task it's going to be very complex

771
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,950
and with the more infrastructure the

772
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:49,240
problem becomes even more complex so

773
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,400
companies do not move their

774
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,800
infrastructure overnight to cloud

775
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,150
they're going to do it in phases so that

776
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,430
they can test the waters and they can

777
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,810
decide for themselves whether you know

778
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,740
the cloud is working for them and if

779
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:02,379
they should move the rest of the

780
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,690
infrastructure so there will be cases or

781
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,400
multiple cases where some of the

782
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,050
infrastructure still lies in the

783
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,350
compromise and some of the

784
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:13,510
infrastructure is not 2 o'clock and now

785
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,070
both of these resources need to interact

786
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:17,920
with each other so how do they do this

787
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:20,169
this is the problem that you know

788
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,650
network teams face for instance in terms

789
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:27,010
of implementing these Corrections and

790
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,540
the need to access these resources as if

791
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:31,120
they are in the same infinite array

792
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,750
that's because that is how we have built

793
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,419
all of our infrastructure over the years

794
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:41,680
so in the pursuit of achieving these

795
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:43,720
connectivity there are a lot of things

796
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:47,200
that can go wrong but it still is in the

797
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:50,320
same Iceman's case I assume that the

798
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,870
network admin takes the optimized data

799
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,550
base and exposes it to internet so that

800
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,310
the traffic and it's come directly to

801
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:59,200
the database and you know somebody in

802
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,120
cloud can talk to the database what

803
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,380
databases are never to be exposed

804
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,760
you know openly to the Internet or to

805
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,700
the

806
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,170
many of the outside world so that can

807
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,780
lead to who attack such as brute force

808
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:15,540
attacks a lot of other attacks so

809
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,730
insecure hybrid deployments can often

810
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,889
lead to political security gaps so he

811
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,570
need to have a proper strategy in case

812
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:24,300
you want to connect your on-prem

813
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,620
resources to the club resources and

814
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,050
before we jump into the solution and

815
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,479
just spend 30 seconds to talk about what

816
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:32,370
are the virtual networks within cloud so

817
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,350
think of them as a network boundaries we

818
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:35,850
played a net for boundary and you add

819
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,919
resources to that red firm boundaries

820
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,810
now all of these resources can talk

821
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,880
internally among themselves they can

822
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,440
talk privately so if one resource need

823
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,300
to talk to another resource it doesn't

824
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,700
have to come over internet it can just

825
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:50,159
in each other using the local or you

826
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,600
know private addresses so you can create

827
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,730
virtual networks as many virtual

828
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,290
networks as you want in the cloud now

829
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,760
let's go to the solution part and see

830
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,800
what are the couple of solutions that we

831
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:02,220
have the first thing is the virtual

832
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,760
private network gateway connectivity so

833
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,740
what happens as part of the solution is

834
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:11,520
you need to install you need to set up a

835
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,679
VPN server or VPN gateway within the

836
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,239
compromised environment and the cloud

837
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,700
provider himself will have another

838
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,080
gateway on his side and you connect both

839
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:22,830
of these gateways using a site-to-site

840
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:26,190
VPN so I guess some of you might be

841
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:29,279
using VPN to access your network from

842
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,540
you laptop that's a point to say VP in

843
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,910
this case since we are connecting a

844
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,889
virtual networking cloud to the

845
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:36,960
on-premise network this becomes a site

846
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:39,509
to set repeal and once this connectivity

847
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,040
is established by your networking all

848
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,560
these resources can talk to each other

849
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,469
privately as if they're in the same

850
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,469
network just like you know interact

851
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:55,168
there is the other solution involves

852
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,970
establishing a dedicated connection

853
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:59,759
between the cloud network in the

854
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:02,669
optimized network so they take advantage

855
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,370
of Internet service providers who will

856
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:08,880
actually come and physically connect

857
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:11,700
both of these using dedicated networks

858
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,070
which means the communication that is

859
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,049
happening between these two is not over

860
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,740
internet it's a completely private

861
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,020
network

862
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,290
nobody has

863
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:29,150
to the network so if we come quickly

864
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:31,310
compared both of these scenarios so the

865
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:33,410
first thing is about the traffic right

866
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:36,320
so in first case the traffic still goes

867
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:39,410
over internet or IPSec protocol of

868
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,700
course it is an encrypted connection but

869
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:45,859
it still goes on within the Internet and

870
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:48,439
the second whereas in the other case it

871
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,990
goes it does not go Internet it's a very

872
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,700
dedicated out and because this is a

873
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:55,189
dedicated lock it has it supports higher

874
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,720
bandwidths so in case you will

875
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,570
production workloads are mission

876
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,029
critical for instance think of a stock

877
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:04,730
exchange website where you have no scope

878
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,970
for failure and it will make sense to go

879
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:11,210
with this certificate which guarantees

880
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:17,540
more availability more bandwidth the

881
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:20,510
connectivity so that's great so now

882
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:23,060
these factoids four of these challenges

883
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,350
and now I smell insurance is decided to

884
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,220
move all of their instruction

885
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:30,920
infrastructure to the cloud now their

886
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:34,730
security team comes back and has

887
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:37,340
questions around my security monitoring

888
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:40,730
and alerting systems are right now on

889
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:44,750
permits and all of these systems will

890
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:47,270
not do not connect or obtain the

891
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:50,180
monitoring and security alerts from the

892
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:53,960
cloud infrastructure so now how can I

893
00:36:50,180 --> 00:37:01,629
fix this problem how do I solve this

894
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:01,630
challenge let's take a look

895
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:06,920
so lot of established companies already

896
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,990
have dedicated security teams that

897
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,450
monitor the network and the host layer

898
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:13,790
to identify attacks such as brute force

899
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:16,310
attacks or malware which predict which

900
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:18,500
is spreading across the network or some

901
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:21,110
sort of anomalies in the traffic it'll

902
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,940
maybe there is huge amount of traffic

903
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:25,400
traffic which is being moved from the

904
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:28,010
compromised to the outside world so that

905
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,680
then triggers another so they do monitor

906
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:34,820
for these kind of attacks and scenarios

907
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:38,180
within the entremets world and they

908
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:40,340
often use tools such as SIEM which

909
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,890
stands for security incident and demon

910
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:45,470
management to collate or to gather all

911
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:47,450
of these alerts which are coming from

912
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,149
different systems across the network at

913
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,680
one single place and on top of that I

914
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:55,330
can write my own rules which will

915
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,830
trigger the alerts whereas in the cloud

916
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:59,960
you do not even have access to any of

917
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,940
the network to scan the network to start

918
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,800
with because most of the underlying

919
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,890
infrastructure is owned by the cloud

920
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,980
service provider so the question of how

921
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:11,629
do I monitor for security incidents and

922
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,510
evils in cloud is a very valid question

923
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,950
and remember these tools that we use

924
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,690
within the mantra my spell book they

925
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,640
don't have any out of walk solutions to

926
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:23,050
say I can monitor cloud it will give you

927
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:26,450
the alerts right so we able to see how

928
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:28,010
this will be addressed and another

929
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,629
important point to remember here is that

930
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,420
the threat landscape in cloud is very

931
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:34,280
different from the mantra minds Network

932
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,020
for instance let's say one of the

933
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,480
credentials of your on-premise

934
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,070
workstation are compromised now can

935
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,050
somebody directly connect your machine

936
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:44,180
no he needs to be in the network

937
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:46,010
initially and then he can exploit it

938
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,720
whereas in the cloud if there is a

939
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:50,090
virtual machine that is public facing

940
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,339
get such credentials compromised I

941
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:55,220
considered my own connect to the virtual

942
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:57,440
machine and you know control it so we

943
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,509
need to understand that the threats are

944
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,250
emerging within the cloud and they're

945
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,609
very much different from the traditional

946
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:06,260
attacks in the traditional incidents

947
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:09,500
that we used to witness in the optimized

948
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:12,140
world and security monitoring teams also

949
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,400
need to evolve their strategy in terms

950
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:17,569
of covering this

951
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,000
his new attacks with respect to the club

952
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:24,000
so the solution for these kind of

953
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,520
scenarios is identify cloud providers

954
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,940
who provide out of box security alerts

955
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,599
as part of the offering so not everyone

956
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,180
does this

957
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,339
so before you switch to a solution just

958
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,259
find out how are the security alerts

959
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:40,520
shown within the clock for instance the

960
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:43,470
screenshot here shows various different

961
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:45,450
attacks or in events that are generated

962
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:48,029
within the club so you can see for

963
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:51,029
confused for networking but storage and

964
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:53,490
data in for applications so in the cloud

965
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:55,650
provider most importantly is is able to

966
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,538
show this information to you because he

967
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,579
has access to the underlying core

968
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:02,400
infrastructure so he can do a lot of

969
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:03,960
things that you cannot and he generates

970
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,539
this for you and gives it to you and you

971
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,369
can also sort it by civilian use or

972
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:11,369
critical issues across on the

973
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:13,970
applications and so how do you monitor

974
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:16,319
them you know once they show the alerts

975
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:18,980
couple of things you can do one needs to

976
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,270
monitor these completely from the 12th

977
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,069
so you can just know into their security

978
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:25,950
centers and you can see all of these

979
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:27,869
monitor directly from there or you can

980
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,460
bring all of these alerts back to the

981
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:31,380
monitoring systems that you have within

982
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,859
the optimized network so there are

983
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,390
options to integrate the solutions for

984
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:39,420
instance you can bring those alerts into

985
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:42,000
your own siem solution so once you do

986
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,430
this you will have one single view where

987
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,740
you can see all the alerts which are

988
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:50,220
related contrivance as well as which are

989
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:52,020
related to the cloud and make sure that

990
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:55,078
you leverage the custom rules feature as

991
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:57,450
well custom rules feature is where you

992
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,910
define certain alerts which you think

993
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,558
are specific to your application so

994
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,990
specific to a business case that I use

995
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:06,680
and you can define these alerts and you

996
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:12,450
can integrate them but to your

997
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:16,919
monitoring solutions as well so let's do

998
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:19,618
a quick recap we talked about identity

999
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,509
so you as a company needs to make sure

1000
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:24,630
that you are in defi what's the right

1001
00:41:21,509 --> 00:41:27,449
the management solution for you and what

1002
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:29,309
is the way you want to configure it the

1003
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:32,939
second one that we talked about was

1004
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:35,849
access control and that means you ensure

1005
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:37,799
you implement role-based access properly

1006
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:39,959
in the cloud leverage the capabilities

1007
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:42,899
that are provided by the cloud in the

1008
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:43,888
solution provider the third one is the

1009
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:48,179
data security

1010
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:50,929
so we leverage the concept of bring your

1011
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:54,509
own keys along with the cloud through

1012
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:57,089
HSN so when I say HSN's there were two

1013
00:41:54,509 --> 00:42:01,889
options simply remember what the two

1014
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:03,739
options were so one was that the HSM

1015
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:06,509
could be your own demise at yourself and

1016
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:08,849
the other could be the cloud solution

1017
00:42:06,509 --> 00:42:11,669
providers Edison and you can pick either

1018
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:12,209
of these choices and see what suits you

1019
00:42:11,669 --> 00:42:15,569
best

1020
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:18,629
the third one was hybrid connectivity so

1021
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:20,369
how do you how do you ensure that all

1022
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:22,139
your resources which are on-premise

1023
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:23,539
connector securely to the cloud

1024
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:26,630
infrastructure that you have in place

1025
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:30,119
there are multiple ways as we discussed

1026
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:32,219
pop quiz yes

1027
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:35,249
side to side was but what was the other

1028
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:38,999
one that was there thank you so much you

1029
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:42,328
guys paying attention the first one was

1030
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:44,399
tap tap into security alert so you have

1031
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:46,469
the monitoring systems organized already

1032
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:47,819
in place you can either use the

1033
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:49,229
monitoring system that the cloud

1034
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:51,179
solution provider gives and there's a

1035
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:53,428
dashpot that they'll provide you can

1036
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:54,749
take a look at a dashboard or you can

1037
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:56,779
feed all the information from the

1038
00:42:54,749 --> 00:42:59,549
dashboard into your own provides

1039
00:42:56,779 --> 00:43:02,639
security systems security monitoring

1040
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:09,919
systems and identifying they care of

1041
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:09,919
those security alerts questions yes

1042
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:24,620
and I would provide us the source and to

1043
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:28,130
their customers right so let me take

1044
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:31,069
that question so the question is how do

1045
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,600
csps deal with land somewhere attacks if

1046
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,700
they will ransomware attacks which are

1047
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,980
spreading within the virtual machine at

1048
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,980
work in the cloud you know how do they

1049
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:41,990
operate so there are two ways of solving

1050
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,820
this problem one is that remember the

1051
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,169
connectivity when we connect them the

1052
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,900
resources which are running in the cloud

1053
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,760
to the optimizer so if you have your

1054
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,920
systems interconnected where you have

1055
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,720
virtual machines running in cloud which

1056
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,640
are joined to your domains within the

1057
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,560
optimized network and within your

1058
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,180
occupies if you are having the policy to

1059
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,490
verify for such kind of ransomware

1060
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:03,350
attacks you will be covered it's the

1061
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:05,060
more but let's say you are not covered

1062
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,380
you don't have any connectivity and your

1063
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,210
virtual machines are running in

1064
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,880
isolation within the cloud then what

1065
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,500
next so cloud providers do have this

1066
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,670
technology at least when it came to

1067
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:18,890
wanna try ransomware you know situation

1068
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:21,140
cloud providers receive updates with

1069
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:25,400
respect to which machines are rented

1070
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:27,879
because a lot of these machines so they

1071
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,880
do have

1072
00:44:32,840 --> 00:45:33,280
even without the cloud is the only

1073
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,280
public cloud is what you

1074
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:42,890
your feet might be - think I got that he

1075
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,570
didn't it is required for powder okay so

1076
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:46,868
when we say cloak will generally talking

1077
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,869
about

1078
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:26,500
in statistical reports of the Fox to the

1079
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:28,420
customer what they can show you is I

1080
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:33,550
should they can assure you for instance

1081
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:36,070
that your application will not be denied

1082
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:38,740
service attacks because they have other

1083
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:40,650
software and other analytics like now is

1084
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:43,089
very big right so they have no order

1085
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:45,730
analytics and intelligence to figure out

1086
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:47,920
whether a particular server is being

1087
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:52,270
attacked on multiple places none of that

1088
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,369
so the issue of you from distributed

1089
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:59,500
denial of service attacks anyone but

1090
00:46:54,369 --> 00:47:01,900
they don't offer you what they also we

1091
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:05,730
talked what the carabiner name one big

1092
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,730
line that's their application

1093
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:28,279
around

1094
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:44,770
[Applause]
