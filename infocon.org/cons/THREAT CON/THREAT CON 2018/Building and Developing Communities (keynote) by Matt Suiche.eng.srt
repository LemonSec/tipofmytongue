1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:11,340
hi everyone so first please surround the

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,440
factors from the threat gun team like

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,950
you guys did a really awesome job like

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,779
gathering like stickers - moreover and

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:25,549
making sure that the room is for today

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:28,050
so it's always a pleasure to see that

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,390
security communities are like growing in

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,460
all the places of the world especially

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,309
when it's outside of North America and

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,630
Europe and Russia of course like which

11
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:44,629
is pretty big accuracy that zero night

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:48,030
last week I think so

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:51,960
when we had some introduction now so but

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,600
basically like our previous MC was

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,370
saying service security company based in

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,420
Dubai so I used to live in San Francisco

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,129
where I used to ever start doing like

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,049
containers for Windows who were

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,670
basically like the docker equivalent for

20
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:11,700
Windows before we go to quite a few more

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:15,510
and then I decided to to move to Yui

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,700
just to like do more traveling and and

23
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,830
then I did observe starting a conference

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,299
over there

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,400
but it was not my first conference like

26
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,770
back in France like eight years ago I

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,440
used to renege to security conference in

28
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,509
France so no such Governor monkey - ago

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,610
so I don't want like the first people to

30
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,850
actually like bring like foreign

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,150
speakers to France is the the French

32
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,940
community itself being like very like

33
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,740
francophone so it's very like even like

34
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,110
when you would read like blog post or

35
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,570
forums everything would be like written

36
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,830
in French so it was like the first time

37
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,039
we started to be a bit more

38
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,509
international with like more

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:59,790
international speakers which was pretty

40
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:01,860
well received and like we like we heard

41
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,950
in the in the opening of the conference

42
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,200
a lot of us and every time I go into

43
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,080
different country and I think we did

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,140
when we started in France's you go to

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,940
black hair Def Con you know like was

46
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,769
amazing resort those guys doing life

47
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,120
those different research and topic that

48
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,890
would not necessarily like Luke at so

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,880
for instance in France we have a pretty

50
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:27,559
strong like reverse engineering same but

51
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,250
mainly because a lot of people in France

52
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,320
used to be like crackers before like

53
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,630
focusing on exploit development so if

54
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,299
you if you look at reverse engineers in

55
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,310
France a lot of them are pretty strong

56
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,310
because they come from the cracking soon

57
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,890
that's an official obviously and I don't

58
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,959
know if you're familiar with the shadow

59
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,720
walkers but when I was covering all

60
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,959
their stuff like last year they is they

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,570
called me a fun guy speaking about the

62
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,800
shadow Walker so I'm gonna give a

63
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:06,019
question at the end of the presentation

64
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,989
and if you answer it like successfully

65
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,600
you can get free t-shirts from our

66
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:15,290
conference which was designed by mal

67
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,230
Williams with the designer for Def Con

68
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,390
artwork so she can be accepted to do

69
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:25,268
like one out work force for the

70
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:28,820
conference this year so let's discuss

71
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:33,470
like a bit about cyber and why it's

72
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:35,420
important to to develop black

73
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:39,620
communities and where we need to tackle

74
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,420
like issues in technology so like one of

75
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,940
the first thing about cyber security is

76
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,100
like as we know is cross domains so the

77
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,989
good thing about cyber security is is

78
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,209
not only like web application

79
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:52,370
development is not only like mobile and

80
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,280
can be like literally like anything like

81
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,940
a friend is doing like research on cars

82
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,040
on software even on hardware so there is

83
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,380
no limit to like the scope of things you

84
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,910
can learn so that's a good thing about

85
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,620
it because even when you think you're

86
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,209
like kind of like say no I know if you

87
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,900
realize you're not at all so there is

88
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:13,700
always like a stuff to learn and one of

89
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,070
the big problem usually with

90
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:20,060
security and I'm sure you're aware of it

91
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,099
is to be heard and to be taken seriously

92
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,760
especially if you are like security

93
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:30,350
researcher and if technology or security

94
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:35,570
is not important in in your like company

95
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:37,490
or like wherever you're walking so I've

96
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,860
seen a lot of people ignore things I'm

97
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,770
sure you recognize what that picture is

98
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,600
from to be honest it could have been a

99
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,159
jet and that like the same thing you

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:51,140
know like we bought the wires and the

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,760
routers like spread all over but funny

102
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,560
enough one of the issue of like the

103
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,020
Central Bank of Bangladesh was due to a

104
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,570
router that was accessible from outside

105
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,150
so it was kind of funny to walk around

106
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,210
at night and to see like the routers and

107
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,370
the cables over there I see AB you and

108
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,820
surprised it talks but in inside fluids

109
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:16,850
and out you know like to make such thing

110
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:19,250
walking so it is an open question and

111
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,080
that's something you know like you can

112
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:26,450
is it's a question that you're gonna

113
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:28,609
think about too during your career is if

114
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,460
you're researchers or like I was saying

115
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:35,150
before it's very important to find a way

116
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,310
to be taken seriously and to be hurt so

117
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,140
raising awareness is of you see one of

118
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,120
them because sometimes you may have the

119
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,450
most awesome research but no one is

120
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,000
gonna care about it and that's basically

121
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,700
why a lot of like security researchers

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,760
or companies ended up like registering

123
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,849
domain names creating a logo and a fact

124
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:59,360
section for like learn abilities and

125
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,040
found if you do that in early like mm I

126
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,930
mean the 90s like people be like

127
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,790
shouting at you and be like what are you

128
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,820
doing you know say would you be like

129
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,590
that's totally total nonsense now that

130
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,719
something which became like more

131
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,859
normalized and because like a lot of

132
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,610
hackers now playing the game of like

133
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:23,330
giving the answers to what people want

134
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,780
but if you are new community like the

135
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,469
first

136
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,809
to focus on this and even if you're like

137
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,520
well established communities that's why

138
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,910
there are like so many conferences now

139
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,530
all over and if you look compared to

140
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,840
like 10 years so if I'm like 20 years

141
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,929
the amount of security conferences now

142
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,429
is like really big and it's not rare to

143
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:49,220
see like security conferences that

144
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:51,590
conflicting on with each other so the

145
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,740
question that you frequently can ask

146
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,919
yourself is what's first what's the best

147
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,790
way to communicate with all the hackers

148
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:03,469
preferably like people who are like

149
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:05,480
better than you and if you're better

150
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,070
than the other people like you always

151
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,050
will never want to give back to the

152
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:13,219
community and be able to mentor like

153
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:15,229
newcomers like it was said before first

154
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,110
source like City FL good way and like

155
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:20,300
you shouldn't be afraid to go

156
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,250
intimidated to try like new challenges

157
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,110
to like constantly learn new things and

158
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,830
that's one of the thing you you learn a

159
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,360
lot for instance like certifications you

160
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,609
know like people that are really

161
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,820
bragging about their certifications like

162
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,410
certificates they have it's nice it's

163
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,940
cool but you know at some point you're

164
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,700
gonna realize that there is a huge gap

165
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,050
between certification and security

166
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,870
research and that's something that

167
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,910
people don't always mention because a

168
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,940
lot of people work really apt already

169
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,500
out for their certifications and I'm not

170
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,890
saying they're bad as actually like a

171
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,180
pretty good against real ever so big

172
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,830
when you want to start something and

173
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,760
you're not sure like where to start with

174
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:03,770
but there is like like the the spectrum

175
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,200
of security research is like so wide and

176
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:09,770
so broad knowledge even like to give you

177
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,650
an example before it's like 10 years ago

178
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,479
it was not rare for one person to find

179
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,080
it but I like to do like some phrasing

180
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,690
to do some deadly sting find a bug

181
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,849
exploit it's another reliable exploit

182
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,850
for like any type of platforms or even

183
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,850
the operating system web browsers now

184
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:32,000
everything has become like so complex

185
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,530
that usually you would see multiple

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,220
people collaborating so some people

187
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,559
would be like

188
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,580
good at finding bugs in browsers some

189
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,369
people will be like really with

190
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:45,560
exploiting website like Windows kernel

191
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:47,810
bugs like iOS bugs like user no caramel

192
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,709
so you would see like it's becoming more

193
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,719
and more fragmented

194
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:54,950
because like the complexity of like the

195
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,140
problems who are facing now is also like

196
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,770
increasing and obviously you always have

197
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,520
those issues were like my best ones are

198
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:07,280
being reused and everything

199
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,350
more like sequin injections but if you

200
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,730
think of as a spectrum of threats you

201
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,580
know especially for in financial

202
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:18,410
institutions which is one of the big

203
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:21,110
threat in countries with low resources

204
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,560
when it comes to IT and security because

205
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,480
some nation-states like to target

206
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,780
countries in Central America in Africa

207
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,580
or Southeast Asia because they know they

208
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:36,170
are understaffed when it comes to

209
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:40,790
security and if you're like let's say

210
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:43,189
like a malicious group or like bad or if

211
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,480
you're on a threat actor like most of

212
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,700
the time you're going to be looking for

213
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,990
like the money right so banks are like

214
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,210
always the first one like if you are

215
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,280
talking about you know like critically

216
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,250
critical infrastructures a source of a

217
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,720
problem but what we see usually is or

218
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,150
necessary some political involvement

219
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,990
people always like target well the money

220
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:08,990
is so and when it comes to banking

221
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,550
malware so big problem so like what

222
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,100
vulnerability is a good thing but

223
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:17,150
malware's also like an actual like

224
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,310
problem and if you have a research that

225
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,319
you want to be reviewed by your peers or

226
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,209
if you want to share some research or

227
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,660
read more research what will be the best

228
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:28,490
way for that and if you are blocked on

229
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,520
some stuff like I said since things are

230
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:35,860
becoming incredible in like becoming

231
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,860
more and more complex or do you

232
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,230
collaborate with all the people who may

233
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:44,980
be more specialized on an area

234
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:47,620
you all so the good thing is a lot of

235
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,740
things happened over the past 30 years

236
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,060
so I digit so I was checking connect on

237
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,190
the we keep it here that you have a few

238
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,420
nights ago I was like oh I was wondering

239
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,160
what was like the first technical

240
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,099
conference because in my mind it was

241
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:05,439
always like my best if you like Def Con

242
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:07,330
so that some events in the 80s CCC

243
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,580
itself was like founded before that

244
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,340
anyway so I don't know if you're

245
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,370
familiar with CCC person have never been

246
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,690
to the conference in in Germany because

247
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,220
it's always perfecting with New Year's

248
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,700
Eve but it's one of the bigger was like

249
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,230
acting convention in the world and but

250
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,900
they've done like a lot especially in

251
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:29,410
Europe when it comes to like Prive see

252
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:33,310
if an IT security research because even

253
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:35,829
like even not that long ago when for

254
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,859
foundations like EF f at any FF is like

255
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:42,310
20 years or now so before they started

256
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,660
to work with researchers if you were

257
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,390
researcher before it was very

258
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,890
complicated to share you share your

259
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,660
research like safely you know you would

260
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,050
always be a friend to be sued by a

261
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:56,160
company it happened like few times and

262
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,660
brackets and then you always a mech

263
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,280
Association like EF f were providing you

264
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,310
like we've know you gotta support and

265
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,780
that's really also walk because no it's

266
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,359
like the whole spectrum of things and

267
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,579
even like knowing the law itself is part

268
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,520
of the spectrum of like security

269
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,770
research office most of the time you try

270
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,480
to follow a bit of what's going on

271
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,510
because you want to know if you're

272
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,980
posting it online or not because if you

273
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,790
have an issue and the one is gonna care

274
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,040
if you don't know not so like DEFCON is

275
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,349
obviously like one of the big one so it

276
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,709
got started by Jeff Moss when he was

277
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:38,020
like 18 that's pretty long time ago I

278
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:40,120
was five years old back then but and for

279
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,220
a long time like security was always

280
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,410
like a us-centric

281
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,440
for like many reasons you know like

282
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:50,560
usually when especially when it comes to

283
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,080
security when you start to see like see

284
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,969
like developing in a in a country or in

285
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,980
a region is usually because you see like

286
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:01,490
some governments report or some support

287
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,110
by like like some of the biggest or good

288
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,290
companies so it can either be like the

289
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:09,380
banks or telco companies like for

290
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,870
instance when we are doing like up cut

291
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,279
in Kenya like earlier in June so we're

292
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,589
doing it in partnership with a local

293
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,730
Medical Group so as I've been around for

294
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,529
like five years now

295
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,200
they started like literally from scratch

296
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:23,720
and so I feel like Kenya people would

297
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,820
expect like no one would do like any

298
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,160
like security research but of like

299
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,320
friends in Kenya were like Kenyans what

300
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,060
I could doing best band research on

301
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,990
doing like reverse engineering minutes

302
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:38,029
so and for doing that even same thing is

303
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,910
also an on cycle but bouncy with one of

304
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:42,650
the year local technical company so they

305
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,839
also give like a lot of like support for

306
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,910
like local groups and that's something

307
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,560
like really important if you want to

308
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,660
garage the community to make sure that

309
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,969
the local establishments are like

310
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,910
supporting initiative and understand the

311
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,830
value in it

312
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,449
because you can go without their support

313
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,820
but you can add was like so much time

314
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,370
and know like interestingly enough since

315
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,529
like start up something like trending so

316
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,330
you have this thing where basically

317
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:11,540
what's used to be like hacker space for

318
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,880
people who just like gather and just

319
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,189
like hacks for instance like in France

320
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,160
we used to have a hacker space called

321
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:23,420
temp lab it was in like you know totally

322
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,740
deserted area next to a train station so

323
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,779
we're basically like squirting the

324
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,920
building you know and the matter of the

325
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,450
big reason we're going in there is

326
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,719
because actress did you was free because

327
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:35,600
it belong to like the French National

328
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,820
Railway services and no one was using

329
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,200
the building so at some point they came

330
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,150
over and they realized they're like how

331
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,570
come there's like so many computers over

332
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:47,140
there but now like you have like more

333
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:50,770
like institutionalize like a crow space

334
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:54,080
no you hear more more more and more but

335
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,699
no like incubators and accelerators so

336
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,770
it's not really like security focused

337
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,150
but the best thing about it is usually

338
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,590
like it's gonna come with like good

339
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,699
internet speed and everything with

340
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:07,730
facilities it also adds you to like also

341
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,900
connect with with other like companies

342
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,660
you know especially if you started with

343
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,130
a concert thing because like services

344
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,689
before you start developing our product

345
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,710
or anything services is always going to

346
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,170
be like the thing you're gonna try to

347
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:20,540
sell so either to like local companies

348
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,490
or anything but if you can collaborate

349
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,230
with like startups or other things it's

350
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,560
a good like spot usually to like get to

351
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,120
know what what people not do it because

352
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,310
something you always need to remember is

353
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,180
like securities or field yes but it's

354
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,739
also like like cross-platform and

355
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,599
CrossFit so it's like the spectrum

356
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,250
itself is not like oh thank you

357
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,380
cybersecurity is just like one thing

358
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,850
like if you do cybersecurity usually you

359
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,650
have to know like everything really well

360
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,320
if you were like web application

361
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,819
security while usually you gonna have to

362
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,530
know what I go to develop that micro

363
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,350
services to relatives and all those

364
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,000
things if you just focus on the tip of

365
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,640
the iceberg you won't be able to achieve

366
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,010
and of understanding of what can be done

367
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,290
so the good thing is knowledge there is

368
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:09,560
a lot of cyber security the conference

369
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,990
is all over so just pretty little small

370
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,589
slide apart like the list is not

371
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,210
exhaustive

372
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,910
obviously I'm pretty focused a lot on

373
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,290
them like know if you look within them

374
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,319
of that website you asked me again for

375
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,480
this 50 cfb time like if you go and see

376
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,010
if the time like you you just like the

377
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,390
number of conferences is like crazy I

378
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,860
think sometimes like you see the

379
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,080
conflicts or the terms of Korea the

380
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,990
countries every year and then you have

381
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,430
like stuff like these sites like started

382
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:37,370
so an eternity like everyone can stuff

383
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,349
like that besides and you have like in

384
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:43,670
besides like even like besides like Oh

385
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:45,410
signature so that's a good thing and

386
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,920
there is like many things to learn from

387
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:51,319
like what indeed already that had been

388
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,949
said before like usually takes time to

389
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,950
be able to do a conference and

390
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,300
like you can see that you guys have been

391
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,700
doing in a critic world over the past

392
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,589
years because especially like when you

393
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,940
do like the first hacker conference in a

394
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,980
country usually it's a lot of stress

395
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,569
because you don't know if you can be

396
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,140
like a lot of the hackers or people as

397
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:14,829
as interested of people are gonna like

398
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,689
try to demonize you like and even like

399
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,839
because they remember when we started

400
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:22,540
like a key to a person in Paris it was

401
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:26,290
like I think like 2010 if I remember

402
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:28,510
correctly and yeah even back then you

403
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,830
know like in Europe being in France like

404
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,900
so many people were like oh no we don't

405
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,730
want to sponsor the event it's a cure

406
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,480
conference you're like here so what you

407
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:39,880
know like like because of people like

408
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,370
using the ethical back award you know

409
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,570
like Deportes I assume that those are

410
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,219
bad hackers who knows they don't

411
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,240
understand that it's us gives it more

412
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:51,220
than anything else and but also another

413
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,179
one of the interesting thing that had

414
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:58,660
been like noticeable over the past like

415
00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:02,590
10 plus years is we started to see more

416
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:04,660
and more like cooperate like security

417
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,100
conferences because initially if you

418
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,620
start a security conference

419
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,110
it would just be done but you know like

420
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,149
your friends right ok like it should be

421
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,590
great to be able to present a research

422
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,510
course or to bring like people from

423
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,418
abroad to learn more about like specific

424
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,400
things and you know like every time you

425
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:22,960
know when we do an event where we're

426
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,500
going to be like on the map you know to

427
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,340
be a knowledge by the secretary research

428
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,440
community like from everywhere but when

429
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,290
Microsoft like started like blue add for

430
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,299
instance so it was like early design for

431
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,909
like Microsoft employees they would

432
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:45,700
bring some of the like researchers like

433
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:47,410
doing research on Microsoft products so

434
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,330
that was one of the first thing and he'd

435
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,130
got a lot of critics because people were

436
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:54,070
like using an ethanolic Metasploit on

437
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,900
stage and employees would freak out you

438
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,730
know they will at home and I converse

439
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,100
in that northern city girl you know like

440
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,620
the the mindset has changed a lot which

441
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,230
is a good thing like now because people

442
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,209
have a better understanding that like if

443
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,559
you just demonize one guy on stage you

444
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,970
know when the guy is like speaking

445
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,649
because it's actually like showing

446
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,510
something while you should not point the

447
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,730
finger to you should be glad for that

448
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,140
person to show something because it

449
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,730
could have been a bad actor and you

450
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,870
could have lost like 50 million you know

451
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:25,480
so Microsoft has understood that pretty

452
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:28,800
well like say like claim that they spent

453
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,620
like one video New Year in cybersecurity

454
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,139
in 10 you use of their own confirms

455
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,600
anything of privat one and then yourself

456
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,820
like older like security companies at

457
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,570
Kaspersky or Co strike or something

458
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,159
their own conferences and something like

459
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,740
10 cents I don't know if you know 10

460
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,730
cents or Chinese like a pretty big

461
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:53,470
massive gigantic company source of their

462
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,360
own neck security event which is like

463
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,480
invite-only I think they like go up to

464
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:03,669
like 100 150 people and that's it you

465
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,380
know and they're like along the time you

466
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,240
always have like a lot of like previous

467
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,610
events or so like an organized event by

468
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,070
the community like FX in Germany used to

469
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:15,760
have like his own invite-only like

470
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,960
conference ph-neutral that was also a

471
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,090
pretty good one because you would know

472
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,860
that not only the speakers but the

473
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,510
attendees also be really good and

474
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,909
something you want to do is to make sure

475
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,879
that the quotes you have attend this is

476
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,559
also like pretty good because you get

477
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,940
through good questions and if you are

478
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:35,129
speaker you get that critical feedback

479
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:39,760
it's pretty pretty awesome in general so

480
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:43,150
to go back to the initial open questions

481
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,650
you know like what's like the best way

482
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,240
to share research and to collaborate

483
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,830
with people so we have seen like

484
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,630
different formats happening over the

485
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:55,240
best thing like 30 years so like

486
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,800
conferences like pretty awesome because

487
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,120
you get to meet activity in real life

488
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,430
and to learn a lot of research

489
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,959
when even when people cannot to attend

490
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,970
you know like II feel like I was

491
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,240
trimming online if you put recording of

492
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:09,830
the dogs online or just like sharing

493
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,140
those slides for instance in our case we

494
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:15,980
just put all those lights for the

495
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:18,760
girlfriends and Gaeta I career space

496
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:21,530
also pretty good because obviously

497
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,870
conference to Judaism once a year event

498
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,940
and you want to be able to make sure

499
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:30,649
that you know like the Kobe Steve active

500
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:32,929
during the year online forums so

501
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,300
personally like when I started like 15

502
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:38,860
years ago when I was still a teenager I

503
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:42,260
used to go a lot on online forums and

504
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:44,270
IRC they were like the top ones like

505
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:48,440
people say use IRC but not as much looks

506
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:50,450
like replaced it and the anonymity was a

507
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,250
really big deal back then no like no one

508
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,370
cares you just but like your full name

509
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,870
everywhere all night from sussed it

510
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,290
pretty good actually like recently I

511
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:02,928
started to do a bit of research and like

512
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:05,090
the the hacking scene for an action

513
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,920
scene for like video games which I was

514
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,928
not family at all i was like oh what is

515
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,360
it gonna do is have actually some pretty

516
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:13,850
legit techniques that they are sharing

517
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,540
on it's like the capcom driver that we

518
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:19,428
used to make the captain techniques that

519
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,530
they used to have to ignore like and

520
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:25,880
send drivers and all those things that

521
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:28,760
come from the hacking community like the

522
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,050
game hacking community even for like

523
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,570
sharing DLL injection to have like some

524
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,639
like undetected method to inject like a

525
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,460
theory in a process by mapping it in

526
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,980
camera space or some pretty legit stuff

527
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,220
and more advanced at which you will see

528
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,710
like usually we've made worse was like

529
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,780
mad bananas is is kind of like it's not

530
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,180
like the firm like the best thing you

531
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:56,100
can do when you deliver some you

532
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,500
your worship the same thing sending

533
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,929
reverse somewheres so it's kind of cool

534
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,450
to see like what type of research people

535
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:07,260
are like working on especially when like

536
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,300
stuff like the NSA kappa and people are

537
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,220
just like discover tools that I like

538
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,440
four or five years old and people like

539
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,540
oh wow that's we didn't think it was

540
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,670
possible but do realize some people were

541
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:20,040
doing it like four or five years ago so

542
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,900
it's always important to keep a very

543
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,700
make pretty correct mindset when it

544
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,320
comes to research because every service

545
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,050
someone who's like way smarter than you

546
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:32,010
know this way it's really important to

547
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:35,490
stay over blog post test it make pretty

548
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,820
good so so far my key it works pretty

549
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,780
well

550
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,220
and even like like ease and so people

551
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:46,110
don't do it anymore I guess you still

552
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:49,410
have TOC or gtfo which is like I guess

553
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:51,959
de pena design therefore while you

554
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,550
affect was like crazy like isn't here

555
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,290
for where you would see a lot of like

556
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,419
security people were getting power as

557
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,970
they would explain how they could pound

558
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:03,270
and do it like start to like leak like

559
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:10,050
they events and everything so zfo met a

560
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:12,350
lot of lot of noise but that was back

561
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:19,610
when I back when things were not as C by

562
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:21,959
between the different a girl groups so

563
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:24,330
like the impact of the security

564
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,570
community service Li you have the social

565
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,250
impact because you get to meet people

566
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,740
you get to learn about what they are

567
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,680
working on and you have to keep a very

568
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:38,130
open mind to know what you gonna focus

569
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:41,670
your research on like next time first

570
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:44,550
dance was it I think it was last year

571
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:46,500
when I spoke at Def Con I was talking

572
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,720
about the decompiler for smart contracts

573
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,210
and the only reason I started it is

574
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,150
because people kept talking about

575
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,590
in motion and I started to get really

576
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,630
annoyed at it so they don't hear that

577
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,790
puts the smart contract and if you look

578
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,770
at it though they're okay it's actually

579
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,510
like a virtual machine in just not like

580
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,190
some like JavaScript code you know like

581
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,350
because if you want a smart contract

582
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:10,010
it's written in surreality which is

583
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:13,699
supposed to a luxurious group and like

584
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:15,620
few weeks later I ended up working in

585
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,110
the disaster blur the disassembler

586
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,969
became like the burger that the burger

587
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,949
became a de compartir for smart

588
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,330
contracts and then I started to do like

589
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:28,520
10 see the Nellie's is to make sure if

590
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:31,520
if I can follow like the like the flow

591
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:34,070
in the program to fund even abilities so

592
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,120
on that it ended up being a Def Con like

593
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:40,610
talk you know but I no reason whatsoever

594
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,270
to get broken and each idea give that

595
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:45,500
presentation or pencils the curls and

596
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:47,030
deduction next since that may be like

597
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,210
three months after to kind of see what's

598
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,520
going on and I read it from time to time

599
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,260
but that's pretty much it

600
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,510
so it's always important to get out of

601
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:01,220
your comfort zone to know like what's

602
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:03,260
gonna be the next researcher because you

603
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,030
can do like XSS for like the next 20

604
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,670
years of your life but you may also want

605
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:11,149
to like very like the type of things you

606
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:14,150
do somewhat to make sure you still stay

607
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:17,890
stay still keep your interest accrued

608
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,890
yeah and you keep learning

609
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:26,420
industry in fact obviously like you

610
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,190
learn like so so much and when you can

611
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,530
like especially NexStar to communicate

612
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,420
you like the product security tips so

613
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,970
which is something pretty good with like

614
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,090
the authorities you know because you get

615
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,980
to like talk to a few the product teams

616
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:42,080
in some cases it's like pretty odd to

617
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,360
have a forget to report it and to just

618
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,030
get like connect your answer and even

619
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,919
now like it was like the USPS

620
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,840
reliability

621
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,580
someone was reading about it today was

622
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,350
affecting like 60 million users

623
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,620
it took them one year to fix

624
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,209
availability so you can I assume that a

625
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:02,489
lot of the time like the communication

626
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:05,560
channels are like really slow and this

627
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,750
in a problem will always be a problem

628
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,490
that's why you know like the the

629
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:12,970
stronger of the community is you know

630
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:16,450
like in your Fiat or your country the

631
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,850
bearer like communication channels you

632
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:23,950
can add with researchers or like

633
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:25,360
companies and even to be a solid to be

634
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,340
honest at some point I will be surprised

635
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,199
if like accurate Uppercross stuff to do

636
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,600
like the earth offers for interesting by

637
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,480
it like they're like bounty researchers

638
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,110
not to do to be a grave accusation good

639
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,010
path to it because like communication is

640
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:44,320
like such a problem usually with vendors

641
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:45,970
even like people were like managing and

642
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,340
click fancy problems no service like we

643
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,740
see you have to expend so much time

644
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:54,429
doing triage I would sexually a granny

645
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,780
they're not you know so like we should

646
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:59,320
try to see that that billionaire

647
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:02,440
producer others it is that they own

648
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,000
coffers but say it's the next lecture

649
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:14,670
but bounce use are likely to make smoo

650
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:14,670
services ok so it's already exist

651
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,050
yeah like even make you know like the

652
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,730
demand side you know you used to make

653
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,440
sure like people understand I overly

654
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,930
like things around you know that you

655
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,810
don't want to be accused to be respite

656
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:31,120
and birth in jail for life you know so

657
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,350
you know like people refer like ask you

658
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,820
know like even people we don't do

659
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,129
secrets you know once he asked you like

660
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,809
your guru too bad accurate

661
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,460
if a character you like you have to make

662
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:40,120
sure to spend the time to expand to

663
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,340
their deaths

664
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,989
it is not that black and white you're

665
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,330
like usually like people have a very

666
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,340
black and white

667
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,720
music is not lead to good things so you

668
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,350
have to make sure you expend that to

669
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,299
people because knowing those those men

670
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,549
set gives get spread and then you know

671
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:59,889
it flashes back usually so you have to

672
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:01,960
make sure people understand that it's

673
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,789
not like your positions many liquors

674
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,919
keeps at first you know if you hackers

675
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:09,100
because of like your skill set you know

676
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:12,490
not because you have a certification or

677
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,439
then your can a sequel accurate or not

678
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,940
so you have to make sure that people

679
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,730
around you especially people on earth

680
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,480
insecurity understand that because then

681
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:24,309
like it creates a lot of like

682
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,230
misunderstanding like in the in the long

683
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:28,990
term and then so you end up having to

684
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,809
like create rec websites when you have

685
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,570
already with like a domain name logo and

686
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:36,220
frequently asked question before I quote

687
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:39,220
the journalist well basically because

688
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,720
even ask you and so because question is

689
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,120
give them like all your questions or

690
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,549
answers in your care just like do

691
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,049
something with it and the surfing you

692
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:49,900
see more and more especially for like

693
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,580
out where like when abilities and those

694
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,100
very few people on this and like are

695
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:57,189
working abilities and they just assume

696
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:00,010
it's a can of something that was only

697
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:02,309
Nadab very few of the past like twelve

698
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,309
months

699
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:09,889
that's something that became in creating

700
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,639
come on like today I cannot spend

701
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:17,190
Catholic be I'm not too late

702
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,560
critic or even abilities like you know

703
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,590
related to lay out where that that been

704
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,810
like police purpose eyes on published

705
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,699
over the past twelve months but if you

706
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:28,139
look at the number the size month there

707
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,360
is even more is to see like when it

708
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,120
comes to like him where it is

709
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,040
if you explain what God's basically like

710
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,280
especially for a medical device and

711
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,800
everything like a security researcher

712
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,260
like called Barnaby Jack we used to do

713
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,240
the HTM Jake for things I had black cats

714
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,000
was that you actually came over like

715
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,580
instead of an ATM and was showing like

716
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,710
bills like coming up to the ATM

717
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,139
that was basically is proof of concept

718
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,590
for like the conference so that was

719
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,930
pretty cool it was one of the first

720
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:02,209
presentation that was done where you

721
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,560
would see like a researcher actually

722
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:07,380
acting something like you know like live

723
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,790
with an actual device and then after it

724
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,690
detects some research on like pacemakers

725
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:15,690
and insulin pumps but a lot of like this

726
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,600
NBD device you know like the IOT type of

727
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:20,850
thing you know like they are feel more

728
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,830
usually like incredibly bad like carrots

729
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:25,260
cut from the nineties like the quality

730
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,050
of code or the things so if you're like

731
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,150
C C++ cars from like the 90s you know

732
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,980
you you have Nicole those things like

733
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,570
stack overflows you know like these

734
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,480
things you do not even be able to

735
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,600
exploit any more on it I make more than

736
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,290
operating system so a lot of the

737
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,100
medications that you see being

738
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:46,110
introduced now by that our our like

739
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:50,010
usually not even in place when it comes

740
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:53,040
to like those devices and blinking or so

741
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:55,379
it was like because I like the demand in

742
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,030
like the the streamline insecurities

743
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,830
like pretty neck straight for for some

744
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,750
stuff you know like if you look at with

745
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:05,760
Intel and arm are doing first and score

746
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:10,170
like like out where and where is exactly

747
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,860
versus a s DX you know like we are like

748
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:16,470
the point identification with our neck

749
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:18,030
77020 I mean you cannot guess what

750
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,910
people are looking at talk about that

751
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:23,700
can't panic at all they've got making

752
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:26,220
one or two years like SGX you know lot

753
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,080
of researchers were actually reading

754
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,360
respect you know like Intel and every

755
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,310
time there is something you people knew

756
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,199
that okay that would become like

757
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:37,260
something trendy and you know with it

758
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,490
like an exception and attacks and I said

759
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,550
could you change you know you cannot

760
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:43,410
hear about like more exceptional attacks

761
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,149
you know per year to like get to know

762
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:47,370
just act easier because I must have to

763
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:50,010
review both of brackets we would like

764
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:52,709
more than 1,000 submissions you know so

765
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,820
you can of see which is also one of the

766
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,170
thing I like about the thing in the

767
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,909
review both of brackets is that you

768
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,480
cannot see what people are talking about

769
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:01,320
and the type of research people are like

770
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,440
focusing on so it gives you a little

771
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,689
insight but also you also need to be

772
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,700
able to like an available for see what

773
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:11,700
people are gonna like fish

774
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,620
this also something you have to do but

775
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,060
you do also as a conference organizer

776
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,399
because you want to make sure people to

777
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,810
talk about really venting so you have to

778
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,860
like kind of guess okay was going to be

779
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:24,389
like trendy like I am looking in like

780
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:27,629
nine twelve months you know like for

781
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:30,120
instance now like like they say like few

782
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:32,280
like humans back like five months ago in

783
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,909
TED talks about the new feature called

784
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:39,090
NMS so I trans memory scanning we can

785
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:41,610
use the basically CPU feature to do like

786
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:43,590
searches in process memory in a bunch

787
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,300
faster way Mike I wouldn't be surprised

788
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,760
to see like people talking about it and

789
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,220
see like oh we can use it to like search

790
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,620
for like he's in every

791
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,570
and all that go things like that so if

792
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,040
just like keeping track of what vandals

793
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,689
are doing you know it's a pretty good

794
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:01,070
thing because it helps you to Catholic

795
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:04,940
through all the noise I mean especially

796
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:07,129
like I like Microsoft is doing a pretty

797
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,200
good job I think publishing more and

798
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,420
more like detailed articles every time

799
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:15,109
there is something like a new features

800
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:17,830
like an issue for the Deaf Western and

801
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:20,060
Twitter the equal sex I'm gonna do stuff

802
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:22,790
then you have companies like Apple you

803
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:25,310
know who are like not as open about what

804
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,840
they do because it's if you say you do

805
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,630
security people vanishing you're

806
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:34,270
insecure so you just don't talk about it

807
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:34,270
you have different approaches to it

808
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:50,168
so when the bounty started to be a thing

809
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,149
so we with some friends we started

810
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:53,830
something called the security vacation

811
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:56,409
club because at some point when I was

812
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:59,380
speaking to so many conferences at all

813
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:01,240
like okay let's say like well part of

814
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,630
like this secret Club could be a

815
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,040
security vacation club and everyone was

816
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,020
like oh well it sounds already your

817
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,330
prestigious what is this you know become

818
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,070
a member or a garden or again we don't

819
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:15,640
know who is behind it you know like I

820
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:17,650
think it's invite-only you know and when

821
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,680
Facebook started their big bounty

822
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:24,099
program so Alex rice who is one of the

823
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,859
founder of echo 1 used to be a Facebook

824
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:29,080
before we started our k1 so he's one of

825
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:30,880
the person who started like the big

826
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,250
bounty program at Facebook

827
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,200
this tactic to do like his debit card

828
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,030
you know like where as if he would get

829
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,848
your payment on the contacts made up to

830
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,950
what they do it now so it was before the

831
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:43,480
companies existed and they were just

832
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,390
like paying of that saying okay that's

833
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,070
good especially you know like people

834
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,549
like Charlie leader and you know they

835
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:54,730
savino's up those things where I was

836
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:56,410
just like let's say code name like 14

837
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,180
quick movements you know I collect no

838
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,560
more like free bugs because of some

839
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,080
point people were just like publishing

840
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,849
books for free and it was one of the big

841
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,759
problem because before like okay if you

842
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:09,040
publish books for free why thank you bye

843
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,040
you know you will not get college sports

844
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,509
and you know if your security researcher

845
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,580
usually even if you get like a t-shirt

846
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,440
you know like you know they you are

847
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:21,160
happy with you but that is no other or

848
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,920
they tried to walk you know so when the

849
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,319
big bouncy problem a lot of security

850
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,530
researchers were sort of pretty critic

851
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,839
of it but it was also like a new way for

852
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:34,270
companies to be able to get in contact

853
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,220
with security researchers and also like

854
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:39,490
to give them compensation so from that

855
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:41,080
perspective it's very good so like we're

856
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,740
at this thing were like even Charlie

857
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,089
talked about

858
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:49,270
Oh Finch's 2012 like we're saying oh

859
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:50,920
thank god but the SBC cough is like more

860
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,750
prestigious if you wanna go what is this

861
00:36:50,920 --> 00:37:00,700
means to take a secret big bounty

862
00:36:52,750 --> 00:37:02,619
program so not for like if you have

863
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,799
questions you can ask them but before

864
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:09,910
going to ask my question to you away

865
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:13,270
like the the t-shirts so what was the

866
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:26,560
name of the utility from the NSA that go

867
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:29,530
through these before that was like that

868
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,369
was used to bypass the toxification in

869
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,369
Oracle database

870
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:44,180
see no no accessories here sorry it was

871
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:46,040
a utility that was basically designed to

872
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,549
patch like the identification or

873
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,950
retaining said the record process so and

874
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:55,790
the reason they add this is because if

875
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:59,710
you have a swift server so most of

876
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:03,860
financial institutions and it was leaked

877
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:06,020
into facts where they were explaining or

878
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,640
they attacked is through service bureau

879
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:11,000
so which is also interesting because

880
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,740
before that no ID that the soup service

881
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,720
bureau was an actual thing so busy he's

882
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,279
like the club for like financial

883
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,169
institutions if they don't want to

884
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,880
maintain their own swift severance but a

885
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,370
lot of the data is extolled on the

886
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,770
record data base and but before you have

887
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,810
access to it to be trance if you get it

888
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,120
so after like a tunnel through the

889
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:34,160
purpose always you're like control code

890
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:37,040
execution and dimension so they were

891
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,299
using these utility utility code the

892
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,400
best really so I wrote a blog post about

893
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:47,800
where basically for like having an X 70

894
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:51,140
different version of Oracle they would

895
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,750
just patch I like think three functions

896
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:56,089
like literally legs would just change

897
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:59,720
like a gem like a cheesy into the

898
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:02,000
courier Genz and that's it like you just

899
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,149
be able to connect to the database and

900
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
you notification there's admin without

901
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:12,140
any problem so it was like supported for

902
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,540
it most of I'm if you look at like the

903
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:16,279
Oracle like advisory reports uses

904
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,990
they're like a lot of boxes you know so

905
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,180
it was under in that case it's not to

906
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,830
get a bug like eternity to go back but

907
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:25,879
execution and imagine you look at the

908
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:29,090
process see memory new batches so like

909
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,160
you since like being a positive process

910
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:33,830
is not something easy unless you're like

911
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,319
a DRN process so it was very like

912
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:39,719
trivial for like for them to like

913
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:45,949
sorry just put the best food you should

914
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:45,949
have any conspirators name that's pretty

915
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:52,140
yeah if you just looked at that you

916
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:53,940
should sign it so it wasn't one of the

917
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,440
like interesting tours you know like

918
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,239
people talked a lot about like they were

919
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,819
first on anything but it actually years

920
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:03,299
like a lot of like really interesting

921
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:07,049
utilities what's this no one like found

922
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:10,288
the the answer so I'm just gonna give

923
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:13,739
the t-shirt to the first person to ask a

924
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:30,479
question scientist you have to ask

925
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:33,440
questions any questions no to speaker so

926
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:36,509
good question so the question was

927
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,079
usually wealth of the top courtiers or

928
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:42,359
like top requirements that you look at

929
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:45,979
when you talk review and if you want to

930
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,979
talk to be accepted at the conference

931
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,359
well one of the first thing you look at

932
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:54,239
is if it's something that has been

933
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,029
published already or nuts and the simple

934
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,140
thing you look at usually is

935
00:40:56,029 --> 00:40:59,819
interpersonal submitting to talk

936
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,279
actually did the research on it or

937
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:05,308
they're just using next one is to which

938
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:07,529
is something we see a lot which may pass

939
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:09,509
in like some conferences but if you like

940
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:12,059
do a conference where you keep like the

941
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:13,440
technical that quite you really I do you

942
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:16,529
want to make sure that the people were

943
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,900
presenting something detect you like the

944
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:20,279
research I'm actually back do throw and

945
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,390
get the two together show you know

946
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:25,619
because if it's someone who's you know

947
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:27,479
sure or to use that Kelly and then in

948
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,600
school if you do workshop and introduce

949
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:30,220
and also if you want to

950
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,250
they teach to other people are like an

951
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,810
introduction to like security tools if

952
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:37,000
you were to speak at the conference I

953
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:39,009
you know like for sure like physically

954
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,810
rejected because be like well it's a to

955
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:43,480
demonic workshop type of thing you know

956
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:46,540
just not select you're like yeah secret

957
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,860
research we're like you walked on like

958
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,940
you know like be like one of the like

959
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:53,650
but it's not that you'll be like

960
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,510
parameter they're just like for the sake

961
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:57,400
of asking you know as people like open

962
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,930
your lines of code did you write you

963
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,530
know just to make sure they wrote actual

964
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:04,930
cut because if you do it right any code

965
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:08,260
can be prices you know do that that much

966
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,790
research I mean in some cases you know

967
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,280
like you don't need to have like written

968
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,200
any code but it's a really like

969
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,900
straightforward immediate or if you kind

970
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:28,859
of like for you like personal decision

971
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:28,860
training and any more questions

972
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,850
so the question was when he started to

973
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,080
walk on you the comparator for smart

974
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:11,490
contracts what motivated you to do to do

975
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,620
it because it was something to tell you

976
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,870
different that whether it was easy to do

977
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,580
it

978
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:19,620
what the main reason is like you know

979
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,420
it's up on the independence as a hacker

980
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:24,569
or security researcher in or like you

981
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:26,340
kind of have a bit of public domain

982
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,990
responsibilities you know when everyone

983
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:31,140
talks about some things and you know

984
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:33,029
like for instance if you look at the old

985
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,370
