1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,440
this is such a beautiful country but

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:14,149
anyway that's opposed we should talk

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,609
about things so this is B and actually

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,320
I'm before this conference it was like

5
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:19,849
for the marketing materials I needed

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,029
like you know a picture of me like

7
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:24,349
looking all professional and stuff so I

8
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,710
sent this one I don't know if you can

9
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:30,229
see it very well but basically I'm like

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,480
so it's kind of like become like a meme

11
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:35,510
of sitting like weirder and weirder

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,819
pictures but anyway here's some contact

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,099
info for me again I have cards that

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,430
you'll be able to get if you want to

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:47,480
talk to me about you know anything life

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,310
security you know what not also I wanted

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,550
to share this with you because it's

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:55,820
awesome so I went to the like Chitwan

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:58,519
National Park this week and this is a

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,040
rhinoceros that's like or I guess you

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,100
guys call it a gyda and it's just

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,110
walking down the road like just and then

23
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,329
it walks up to this like street vendor

24
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:12,530
and it's like give me a beer and chips

25
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:15,199
bitch and I felt like that was like the

26
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,939
perfect like metaphor for security and I

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,630
should use it in all my presentations

28
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:22,969
forever because really you can put like

29
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,729
all the security in place possible but

30
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:28,548
when like a rhino walks up and says like

31
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:30,649
I'm gonna take your popcorn none of your

32
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:31,549
security stuff is gonna be able to do

33
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:33,560
anything about it

34
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,389
in fact the street vendor like one of

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,929
the street vendors like was real he-man

36
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:41,839
about it but his wife like took off so

37
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:43,520
yeah the wife was the security person

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,229
and probably the smarter one let's be

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,729
honest we're talking about a rhinoceros

40
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:53,270
here okay so anyway I typically talk

41
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:56,149
about mobile security and you know I

42
00:01:53,270 --> 00:02:00,259
used to be I still AM to an extent like

43
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:02,240
you know zero day rah-rah-rah hacker but

44
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:04,880
I'm also I guess kind of grown up in a

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,329
way and realized that while like zero

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,670
day is is really cool and all like in

47
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,069
terms of actually like helping customers

48
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,950
and everybody from small businesses to

49
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,780
individuals to large enterprises to

50
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,959
governments you know actually secure

51
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,360
their stuff in a reasonable way you know

52
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,490
dealing with you know zero days isn't

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,050
necessarily like the biggest threat for

54
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,910
anybody you know for a lot of people

55
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,070
they're unlikely to get hit it all by

56
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,959
zero day they just you know don't have

57
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,299
that kind of profile that they're gonna

58
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,560
become after a nation-state

59
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,480
but even if if they are and why would

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,000
they bother burning a zero-day if

61
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,399
something like for instance phishing or

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,170
a missing patch or default password

63
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,489
would work just as well so I guess what

64
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,708
I'm actually saying is what I'm gonna

65
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:59,670
talk about is actually not that sexy but

66
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:02,610
it's incredibly effective so this is

67
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,760
kind of like what most of my customers

68
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,070
think their networks are like I you know

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,329
if you see the blue boxes you probably

70
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,720
maybe have seen something like this

71
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,519
before I probably stole it from Cisco at

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,400
some point because they do blue boxes

73
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,620
but the main point being that well I

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,190
mean obviously it's a slide so it's flat

75
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,769
right but the idea being that one that

76
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,950
you know everything's flat and you know

77
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,570
we control everything as IT and security

78
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,450
you know everything on our network we

79
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,820
built it we control it in terms of like

80
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,760
what updates it has what it's security

81
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,340
profile is what we allow users to do on

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,048
it and where the traffic is going you

83
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,310
know in and out of our network we

84
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:49,380
control all that and that's awesome and

85
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,269
not so much I don't know if that was

86
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,750
ever the case but it's certainly not the

87
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,750
case now I mean our our reality now is

88
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,610
so very far away from this that you know

89
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,680
we don't really I like to say the

90
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,720
perimeter has been shattered because the

91
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,790
worst part about it is that we don't

92
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,160
control like anything going in and out

93
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,840
of our network anymore really because

94
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,540
there's all these other ways it can go

95
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,150
in and out you know all our IOT devices

96
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,279
and mobile devices and even some of our

97
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,858
laptops now I've got mobile modems in it

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,608
like this is the way we're going we've

99
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,370
got people who work from home they

100
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:27,938
from coffee shops there you know getting

101
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,849
on potentially hostile networks there

102
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:33,629
hooking up their phones to rental cars

103
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:36,550
you know they're going abroad you know I

104
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,949
know my country you know back in the

105
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,050
u.s. we are you know mobile

106
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:43,840
infrastructure for instance definitely

107
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,849
attacks devices there's certainly other

108
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,258
countries that do as well I don't know

109
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:49,569
if you guys do but some of your

110
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:52,180
neighbors might but we certainly do in

111
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,500
the u.s. you know our infrastructure you

112
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,430
know there's nothing you can do about it

113
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,159
as a user

114
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,590
like it just spies on you by default so

115
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:02,560
you know your devices are going to scary

116
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,539
places the mobile threat model I like to

117
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,210
think of well one I think of like

118
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:09,099
mobility Internet of Things cloud and

119
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,779
you know all these like new things like

120
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:12,580
vapor and whatever they want to call

121
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:13,960
them you know they're really kind of the

122
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,050
same thing you know there are things

123
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,599
that we as IT don't control we as

124
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,370
security don't control like you know the

125
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:23,259
cloud is really the same thing as

126
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,569
somebody's mobile device to me somebody

127
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,370
brings their mobile device onto my

128
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,080
network you know again they're the

129
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,229
administrator of it I don't have a lot

130
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,719
of insight into it I use somebody's

131
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,758
cloud service it's you know I know it's

132
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:40,240
a cloud in the picture but it's really

133
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,949
just somebody servers somewhere and I

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,659
don't have any control over whether you

135
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:45,279
know they're updating their servers how

136
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,919
they're storing passwords in their

137
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,659
database you know I just kind of have to

138
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,758
assume that they're doing a good job if

139
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:53,500
I'm going to use their cloud services so

140
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,930
the threat model I think it's really

141
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,370
similar for I guess all of these things

142
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,740
that you would consider next-generation

143
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,409
they're really just you know taking all

144
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,550
the control out of our hands as security

145
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:09,219
people which let's face it kind of sucks

146
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,080
but they have a very similar threat

147
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:13,659
model to everything we've dealt with so

148
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,000
far you know they have the potential for

149
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:18,159
remote code execution you know no hands

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,600
from the user they just have the you

151
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:21,000
know

152
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,650
send something to like the mobile modem

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,780
or the Wi-Fi chamber the Bluetooth chip

154
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,479
and and the magic happens in the

155
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,429
attackers take over luckily that doesn't

156
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,590
happen that often

157
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,650
there's also client-side attacks you

158
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:37,380
know somebody opens something document

159
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,390
in the PDF view or an e-mail picture you

160
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,330
know a webpage and you know that

161
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,430
triggers a vulnerability and certainly

162
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,890
that has a social engineering component

163
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,350
of you know getting people to go to the

164
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:51,780
malicious files what we really have a

165
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,490
lot of though is different ways that

166
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,229
people can be targeted like on your

167
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,320
traditional machine like you had a

168
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,120
laptop that was running Windows yeah and

169
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,370
it was on the local network you probably

170
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,320
you know go after some open ports on the

171
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,380
thing you know for four or five is a

172
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,280
good one for your server message block

173
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:15,870
which should be like server like message

174
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,969
exploitable but nobody asked me but then

175
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,330
you know on these mobile and IOT devices

176
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,400
we have like I mentioned a couple like

177
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,789
Bluetooth and whatnot I think there's

178
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,859
actually a slide on input/output but

179
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,320
there the point being there's like tons

180
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,870
of ways these things talk and you know

181
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,380
we've we've been kind of pretty good at

182
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,870
sort of like doing a good job of you

183
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,360
know things like intrusion detection and

184
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,320
and egress filtering and next-gen

185
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,420
firewall and and data loss prevention

186
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,790
through like you know just regular like

187
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,530
wired and wireless connection going in

188
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,660
and out of our network at the perimeter

189
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,789
but when you start bringing in things

190
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,100
like mobile modems and Bluetooth and

191
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,100
near-field communication and you know

192
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,810
again there's a slide with like a list

193
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,360
none of those go through that perimeter

194
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,560
and all of that stuff that we put at the

195
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,850
perimeter that we spend all that money

196
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,710
on all gone didn't stop it at all so you

197
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,040
know it's again kind of minutes go back

198
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,659
to the basics what I actually find kind

199
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,520
of funny about a lot of this stuff and

200
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,490
again you have to think of mobility is

201
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,560
like cloud mobility IOT know everything

202
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,750
that we're doing now is that you know we

203
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,930
actually built them with security in

204
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,650
mind which you know that's what our last

205
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,210
two speakers

206
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,669
so we're supposed to do right build our

207
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:38,820
products of security in mind but it kind

208
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,789
of bit us in the foot in this particular

209
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,680
case because the assumption was that you

210
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,569
know everything we built before that it

211
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,029
was like when we built like the personal

212
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,460
computer the idea security was very much

213
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:53,010
an afterthought so all the security

214
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,620
stuff we kind of built on top of it same

215
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,080
thing with like tcp/ip it was like oh

216
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,880
now we need firewalls and things but

217
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,730
when we actually started building these

218
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,050
next-gen devices we thought oh well we

219
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,560
should build them with security in mind

220
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:11,010
so this caused a bit of a problem I like

221
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,170
to use the example of antivirus right so

222
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,600
antivirus gets a really bad rap

223
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,310
everybody hates antivirus but antivirus

224
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,589
does a really good job of one particular

225
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,800
thing and that is protecting people like

226
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:25,140
my mother she the PC in pure science

227
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,569
this is not a my mom can't use computers

228
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,550
story at all she's actually quite good

229
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,490
at it but she loves her some online

230
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:35,699
games never did she meet like an online

231
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,279
game download she didn't just love and a

232
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,070
lot of those let's be honest come with a

233
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,890
little extra features and a lot of them

234
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,290
you know they're not apt by any means so

235
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,080
you know her antivirus you know it

236
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,630
naming me one of them that people use it

237
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,700
pops those and says this is bad it helps

238
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,950
her clean it up and we put it on there

239
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,260
and all I can do because it can't see

240
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,450
the other applications is scan itself to

241
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,250
see whether it's a virus and certainly

242
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,459
there is the possibility of malicious

243
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:08,250
applications in the mobile world but all

244
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:10,770
the work that we've done in antivirus

245
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,050
was now functionally useless just

246
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,569
because you know the mobile device was

247
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,339
just a little bit too secure for that to

248
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,920
work

249
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:22,020
and so yeah I mentioned there's you know

250
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,650
mobile input/output and we've got

251
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:29,130
cellular Wi-Fi Bluetooth the sim card

252
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:32,040
you know those run java the power cord

253
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,630
certainly you know malicious power cords

254
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,939
were a really big thing at Def Con this

255
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,950
year though they have been for years so

256
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,660
I guess the media just liked it this

257
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,670
year near-field community

258
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,079
I mean the main point being that we have

259
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,839
all these other ways these things

260
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,970
communicate and that just makes it that

261
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,220
much scarier because again all the

262
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,260
security that we built is now not going

263
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,770
to work because if it's sitting like at

264
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:59,100
the perimeter tcp/ip of your your

265
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:01,650
network and the attack is going in and

266
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,620
out via the mobile modem you're not

267
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:07,800
going to have any of that egress or data

268
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,480
loss prevention or whatnot and of course

269
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,030
it gets even scarier because when you

270
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,430
bring in a device it you don't just have

271
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,620
the device you have all of the services

272
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:20,280
that come along with it so you've also

273
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:23,070
got like the back end for your carrier

274
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,350
as well as the device itself so anytime

275
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,200
it's pushing updates to the device it

276
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,430
has an app store on any of that stuff in

277
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,620
the background

278
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,680
those are all again this cloud server

279
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,290
somewhere and if somebody on the end of

280
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,650
like the the service provider forgot to

281
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,959
update or use the crappy password or you

282
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,390
know put their or their keys up on

283
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,340
github or something by mistake you know

284
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,380
an attacker can just get in there and

285
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,630
again there's nothing we as the user can

286
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,430
do we haven't done anything wrong if the

287
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,330
actual server that our device is

288
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,469
supposed to respond to for updates has

289
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,050
been compromised

290
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,030
so you know they're actually sending

291
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,250
legitimate updates from the right place

292
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,110
that are signed by the right people it

293
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,090
just so happened somebody else got in

294
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,100
there so you know that makes it even

295
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,960
scarier because it's it's like we don't

296
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,790
just have to deal with one device in one

297
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,650
user we have to deal with you know all

298
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,920
the backend stuff that comes with it

299
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:22,290
that again we don't control which brings

300
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,780
us to social engineering you know I

301
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,430
mentioned that you know this profile

302
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,890
stuff that I'm about to talk about it's

303
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:31,290
really not that sexy and it's not that

304
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:34,080
sexy for the very simple reason that the

305
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:36,779
user has to click yes you know

306
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,760
real hackers you know it's got to be

307
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,040
like remote code execution social

308
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,689
engineering is so not cool but you know

309
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,240
in the real world let's be honest I mean

310
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,600
we take like some of the the coolest

311
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,180
attacks there are like for instance like

312
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,029
the Trident attack which was not one not

313
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,430
two but three zero days against iOS and

314
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:58,920
it all started with a text message in

315
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,689
order for them to get like the first hit

316
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,219
against the browser so basically if they

317
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,740
hit the browser they moved out of the

318
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,519
browser like to user space they move to

319
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,829
user space to root on the iOS device so

320
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,839
it took three different iOS exploits

321
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:15,239
which is you know millions of dollars

322
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,180
worth of exploits but in order to start

323
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,540
this chain they had to get somebody to

324
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,430
click on a link in a text message so in

325
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,829
the real world even when we're being

326
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,810
like really sophisticated there's

327
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:30,300
usually some sort of social engineering

328
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,489
component and you know let's be honest

329
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,920
we haven't really fixed the let's not

330
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,220
click on links in emails thing yet that

331
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,110
works a lot of the time so bringing in

332
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,370
these mobile devices where they have all

333
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,220
these different ways they can

334
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,040
communicate and that just makes it that

335
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,290
much worse

336
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,899
now I mentioned text messaging we

337
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,939
certainly have things like QR codes you

338
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:57,410
know a lot of people just just scan them

339
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,300
and you know they go where they go and

340
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,180
you know things like whatsapp where they

341
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,099
say they're secure I think that gives

342
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,380
people like this false sense of security

343
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,029
that if like they get a link in whatsapp

344
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,189
while it's secure it's not that big a

345
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:13,529
deal but still if they click on it it

346
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,959
opens in their browser so you know it

347
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:17,730
kind of defeats the purpose there it's

348
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,459
still gonna you know work out the same

349
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,980
way basically anyway all of these social

350
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:26,040
medias any way that anybody can be sent

351
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,350
a link that is you know a way they can

352
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,969
potentially be targeted for social

353
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,130
engineering so even people who are

354
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,690
pretty savvy about you know not clicking

355
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,000
on the links in the emails you know they

356
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,080
might find themselves undermined a

357
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,490
little bit

358
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,240
when it comes to some of these other

359
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,400
ways they might be targeted I'm so

360
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,620
certain I just hit the wrong button

361
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,260
alright so I mean certainly there I

362
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,120
think at this point people believe me

363
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,730
that there is an impact to having like

364
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,830
mobile and IOT and whatnot compromised

365
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,260
and your enterprise for a long time it

366
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:01,920
was like well who cares like if you hit

367
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:04,170
my my IOT coffeepot it's not like I

368
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,030
store corporate information or like my

369
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,870
PII or personally identifiable

370
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:13,079
information on my biote coffee pot who

371
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,960
cares if it gets exploited but if the

372
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,840
IOT coffee pot is you know connected to

373
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,700
the local network you know at work in

374
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,190
your office and it's on the same network

375
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,160
as you know your your laptop's in your

376
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:28,290
servers and let's face it nobody has

377
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,020
been able to come up with a way to

378
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,569
completely secure the internal network

379
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,000
let's be honest here nobody's pulled it

380
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,770
off so you've got that one box that

381
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,570
somebody forgot about that something to

382
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,730
the floor that still went running

383
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:46,320
Windows 2000 and the coffeepot it's been

384
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,810
exploited it is able to jump from the

385
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,480
coffee pot to that which has you know

386
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:54,660
the same domain admin credentials on it

387
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,370
as the new domain they had been box and

388
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,839
then that's able to get you you know

389
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,120
access to everybody's laptops

390
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,340
everybody's servers database you know

391
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,380
whatever it is that you're trying to

392
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,570
keep secure there and it all started

393
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,050
with a coffee pot so I mean certainly

394
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:13,230
there are problems to anything that is

395
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:15,089
compromised about hanging around so

396
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,860
that's an example of pivoting which is

397
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,200
my favorite you know getting on one

398
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,560
thing and using it to jump to somewhere

399
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,020
else and you know certainly we can steal

400
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,479
data off devices we can remotely control

401
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,400
devices like if I if I'm on somebody's

402
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,890
phone like I can post a twitter for them

403
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,020
potentially I can record video or audio

404
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,760
of them I don't know about you but I

405
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,680
take the thing in the bathtub

406
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,080
a lot of

407
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,079
this executives who are like in

408
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,450
closed-door meetings if they're being

409
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,540
recorded you know and it gets into the

410
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:50,960
wrong hands per se you know it might be

411
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,719
bad so naturally you know we built some

412
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,510
stuff to try to solve this problem

413
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,550
obviously like the mobile device

414
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,279
antivirus that just scanned itself was

415
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:04,790
obviously not enough so we had to build

416
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,470
some other things so that you know first

417
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,050
we built basically mobile device

418
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,939
management it took the place of a

419
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,399
blackberry beds or blackberry enterprise

420
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,620
server something I've learned a lot

421
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,689
about in business is if there's a line

422
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,428
item in people's budgets for it it's a

423
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:22,400
really good place to like put your

424
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:25,100
product so when people are moving from

425
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,319
iPhones are moving from blackberries to

426
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,939
iPhones and androids they had a line

427
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,428
item for a BlackBerry Enterprise Server

428
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,500
but they had no BlackBerry's anymore so

429
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,900
naturally people made a lot of money by

430
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,910
making mobile device management but

431
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,420
mobile device management was really just

432
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:43,220
there to do provisioning so basically

433
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,650
everybody didn't have to come in to the

434
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,410
IT department and like have their their

435
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,690
email and like their VPN and everything

436
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,910
set up for them like one by one they

437
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,660
could just like basically download a

438
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:59,240
profile and it would magically make it

439
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:02,990
work but it really wasn't doing much for

440
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,760
security so naturally there was a fit

441
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:07,730
for that because people wanted security

442
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,800
for mobility so they basically added on

443
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,380
some more stuff and call it enterprise

444
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,780
mobility management this is probably

445
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,480
what your enterprise has now you know

446
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,980
some subset of an enterprise mobility

447
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,440
management suite

448
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,660
you know everybody and their mom has one

449
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,970
that they're selling you even blackberry

450
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,679
oddly enough bought one so blackberry

451
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,110
has come back as an enterprise mobility

452
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,559
management vendor which i think is

453
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:36,409
hilarious because you know they were

454
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:39,590
blackberry for a while but this is

455
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,360
probably what you have again it's really

456
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,199
a lot of provisioning and a little bit

457
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,539
of security

458
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,489
it's a different talk all together like

459
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:50,149
by passing this stuff in the worst way

460
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:52,220
possible really you have to take into

461
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:54,320
account that any preventive technology

462
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,289
the bad guys are going to either buy it

463
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,210
or pirate it and find ways around it

464
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:01,369
before they send their attacks this is

465
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,320
true of things in the traditional

466
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:07,129
computing world certainly you know any

467
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:10,279
of your your you know next-generation

468
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:13,609
firewalls data loss prevention you know

469
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,019
on on device things antivirus all of it

470
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:16,970
they're all going to be getting past it

471
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:18,799
they're doing the same things here you

472
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,929
know it's not really the point but again

473
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,119
you know in order for this stuff to get

474
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:24,619
set up in order for like the apps to get

475
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,029
on there in order for it to like set up

476
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:29,119
the VPN you know they've set up

477
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:31,639
always-on VPNs for you for your work in

478
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,918
order for it to do that it might do its

479
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:36,168
own SSL certificate I'm you know

480
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,639
anything that it's it's doing an order

481
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:39,619
for it to get around that you know

482
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:42,199
security we talked about where it was

483
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:44,899
just making the mobile antivirus be

484
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,359
useless you know naturally the devices

485
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:50,359
realizes they need to help witness so

486
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:53,600
they basically set up api's for

487
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,730
management applications to be able to do

488
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,100
more to dig deeper into the operating

489
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,840
system and that's exactly you know how

490
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,219
these things are set up you know the

491
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,220
users install configuration profiles to

492
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,889
make this stuff works so you know it's

493
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,289
always nice when our attacks our users

494
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:14,809
are taught to like do the things that we

495
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:17,239
want them to we want to social engineer

496
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:19,489
them into doing as part of how to do

497
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:21,440
their security posture that is always

498
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:23,029
helpful when it's something they do over

499
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,249
and over again to make themselves more

500
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:28,519
secure and to be able to get their work

501
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:30,470
email let's be honest then it really

502
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:33,289
helps with our social engineering attack

503
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:38,659
I mean a mobile application management

504
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:40,460
is generally a part of the mobile or the

505
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:42,019
enterprise mobility management some

506
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,210
people will just have this you know this

507
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:45,769
is white listing and black listing

508
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,570
applications that you're allowed to have

509
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:50,749
it work like you may not be able to have

510
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,970
Angry Birds it may also like you'll see

511
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,340
you have like to burn

512
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,410
of email ones your personal and one's

513
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,780
your work email sort of like sandbox

514
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:01,510
them off separately so at least

515
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,490
theoretically your work apps are secure

516
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,800
again it's a different talk getting

517
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,410
around all this stuff but yeah there's

518
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,120
where there's a will of a hacker there

519
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,640
is a way to get around all of these

520
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,770
things but again in order to put these

521
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,260
apps on there if they're like specific

522
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,600
corporate apps or they've been put in a

523
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,090
special wrapper like it will take like a

524
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,429
normal app and put it in like a security

525
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,590
wrapper but in order for that to work

526
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,740
like if you know anything about iOS you

527
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:32,110
know it has to be signed by Apple so if

528
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,360
we're just like repackaging other apps

529
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,010
you know that's gonna like break all of

530
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,889
that and our mobile application

531
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:41,379
management will just mean no absolute

532
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,270
phone basically um so the way around

533
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,450
this naturally you know Apple had to

534
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:48,910
play ball here and it so that you know

535
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,490
you could get your own like in-house

536
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,190
enterprise developer certificate so it

537
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,920
is signed by Apple but it doesn't go

538
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,360
through the Apple Store like oversight

539
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,890
where you know they check to see that

540
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,320
you're not like doing a bunch of

541
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:05,740
malicious stuff or you know not using

542
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,110
HTTPS or or otherwise just be you know

543
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,760
an awful application which again that's

544
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,159
not perfect either there have been

545
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,300
instances of bad apps getting in the App

546
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,430
Store

547
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,830
but generally speaking having that

548
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,810
oversight is good and by having you know

549
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,730
your own you know enterprise signing

550
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,560
certificate you are able to get around

551
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:27,010
that you can build whatever you want and

552
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,080
you know if the user says yes I can

553
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,810
install it this is what again like

554
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,240
mobile application management does this

555
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:37,450
is what also what jailbreaking apps does

556
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,130
do if you've ever been to like zgo break

557
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,410
or any of the other jailbreaking apps

558
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,930
you know they're obviously not approved

559
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:46,510
by Apple let's be honest but they have

560
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,160
their own developer certificates which

561
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,470
shows you how easy it is to get these

562
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,600
things like it's in the I have a white

563
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,860
paper on this like you think the fact

564
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,649
that I was a security company

565
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,360
specifically going after mobility they

566
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,970
would have thought twice about giving me

567
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,740
one of these certificates but they even

568
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,870
gave them

569
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,850
the jailbreakers so you know you have to

570
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,699
like have a Duns number and stuff which

571
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,559
I don't even know what that means

572
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,230
business stuff but it's really easy to

573
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,540
get one and again you know users are

574
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,340
used to doing it because not just are

575
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,740
they using it to jailbreak their devices

576
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,020
but this is also like how their their

577
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,590
work apps are getting put on there so

578
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,540
again the social engineering is good

579
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,340
same thing within point protection now

580
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,460
we've kind of gone full circle like the

581
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,199
best thing that we're able to do now is

582
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,570
basically mobile antivirus again but

583
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,160
it's mobile antivirus and then some you

584
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,189
know the Gartner people call it mobile

585
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,520
threat defense so it's you know that on

586
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,770
device application that oddly enough is

587
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,330
you have to install a profile cuz it

588
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,580
comes in through enterprise mobility

589
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,860
management

590
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,629
so again users are saying yes I want to

591
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,250
install this application that didn't

592
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,679
come from the Apple App Store it came

593
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,900
from my corporate App Store which means

594
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,910
I have to say yes to a profile so the

595
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,400
whole time we've been teaching users to

596
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:08,550
do security around the iOS we have to

597
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,230
say yes to all these profile things so

598
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:13,649
they've been taught to do it which again

599
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,110
is great for social engineering so there

600
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,420
is a tool that is it's free and Apple

601
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,309
that sets all this up you can read all

602
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,130
the documentation about how you have to

603
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:24,870
like do all the XML and whatnot on to

604
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,850
like automate all this stuff but it's

605
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:29,428
really nice when when Apple is just got

606
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,830
this you know graphical tool where I can

607
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:35,160
literally just click and say what I want

608
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,620
my my profile to say and do it's called

609
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,170
Apple configurator - you do have to have

610
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,840
an apple device to use it unfortunately

611
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:45,210
but nowadays they've got stuff like Mac

612
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,770
and cloud and whatnot so you know if you

613
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,490
don't want to like splurge for the

614
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,160
MacBook

615
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:53,640
there are ways around it but again this

616
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,830
is free just grab it and you've got all

617
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,590
the stuff you can do and this will set

618
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:03,330
up the profiles for you so you don't

619
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:05,939
have to learn any fancy coding so you

620
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,530
know you set up your profile and make it

621
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,790
say what you want to say I mean there's

622
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,990
a lot of things that are really funny

623
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:14,080
about it like

624
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:16,539
you can sign profiles but you also don't

625
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,490
have to sign them they can be unsigned

626
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:21,158
and all it does is warn the user it's

627
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:23,110
unsigned which just like you know any

628
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,720
other unsigned thing has that never

629
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:28,658
stopped anybody if they wanted what was

630
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,590
on the other side absolutely not so

631
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:34,510
there's also things like in terms of

632
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,699
once they say yes because yes they do

633
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,158
have to say yes on that they want to

634
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,279
install the profile but you can set it

635
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:44,200
that once they've said yes they can't

636
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:46,870
ever take it off like literally they

637
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,909
have to wipe their phone out to get rid

638
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,428
of it or they have to have a password to

639
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:52,770
get rid of it which if you don't tell

640
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:55,450
them what the password is is

641
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,490
functionally the same thing so you know

642
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,350
as soon as you say yes once you they

643
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,140
literally might have to wipe their

644
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:05,110
device in order to get rid of you which

645
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,809
is which is nice which I get that they

646
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:11,199
built this stuff for like to make it

647
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:13,539
possible for security apps to work but

648
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,970
you know it's also totally possible to

649
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:18,840
abuse this in the worst way you know

650
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:21,100
with just like basic social engineering

651
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,470
again there is a white paper about this

652
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,730
so like that I have out that goes into

653
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,830
like all the different things you could

654
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,690
do we'll talk about a couple examples of

655
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,480
them that are kind of funny and a couple

656
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,730
of them that are kind of scary and you

657
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,049
can have it like have a message so that

658
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,179
like help you with your social

659
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:39,610
engineering like you know this is just a

660
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:42,100
basic one install this profile to access

661
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:44,260
enterprise email so you know if you're

662
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:47,379
trying to trick anybody in a particular

663
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:49,480
way and put it there again it does say

664
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:54,039
if you don't sign it which you can sign

665
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:56,110
it it's not particularly hard it'll just

666
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:59,100
say the profile it's not signed but

667
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:02,439
it'll still let you install it of course

668
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,289
and again I mentioned you can put

669
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,549
passwords on it or make it pause

670
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:09,070
impossible for them to take it off at

671
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,389
all which again you know the social

672
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,210
engineer them once and they're like

673
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:15,159
stuck with it that's always nice that's

674
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,890
definitely not music coming from me

675
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:20,710
right okay so a couple examples of

676
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,020
things you can do you can like install a

677
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,020
certificate I mean this is just the one

678
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,879
from burp suite so it's not that scary

679
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,370
that you know you see anything with like

680
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,279
malicious routes EA's and things like

681
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:36,309
that having you know an additional

682
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,080
certificate being trusted by an iOS

683
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:40,629
device you know that may potentially

684
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,000
allow people to get access to all of

685
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:45,100
your traffic if they're able to man in

686
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,620
the middle you so certainly tricking

687
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,049
someone into installing your malicious

688
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,729
certificate authority is you know kind

689
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:54,279
of nice it even says on there this

690
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,960
certificate is not trusted but that's

691
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,090
because it's ports where if you can get

692
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,679
around that and you know it warns you

693
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,510
and it says this will add it to a

694
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,039
trusted certificate let's be honest

695
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,029
we're not security people we don't even

696
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,679
know what that means

697
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,630
and again we're used to saying yes

698
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,760
anyway because we do this for work and

699
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:11,500
and this is probably you know the best

700
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,570
social engineering attack for this is

701
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:17,169
making it look like it's an update of

702
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:19,178
your work one so and this one I find

703
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:21,220
really funny pass codes so you cannot

704
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:23,710
actually set somebody's pass code for

705
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:26,049
them luckily I mean that would just be a

706
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,880
disaster because then you'd lock them

707
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:31,840
out of your their phone but what you can

708
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,870
do is like set the minimum passcode link

709
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,840
to like 16 minimum number of complex

710
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:40,418
characters to for maximum passcode age

711
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,299
to like two days so they have to reset

712
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:45,399
it like every two days maximum on a lock

713
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:48,070
one minute so every minute that it's

714
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:50,649
idle you they have to reboot put it in

715
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:52,990
passcode history you can set it down so

716
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:54,610
they like can't use old passwords this

717
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,289
is all really good stuff right if we're

718
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,850
setting password policies these are

719
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:00,580
great but really you're just trying to

720
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:03,149
mess with people in this case maximum

721
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,559
grace period for advice lock immediately

722
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:07,570
maximum number of failed attempts you

723
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:10,480
can set it down to like two so basically

724
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:12,610
you've pretty much Doster denial of

725
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,139
service there device there so if you

726
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,899
really just want to like mess with one

727
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:18,508
of your friends this is a fun one I mean

728
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:20,639
from l-like actually take

729
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:22,499
over there device perspective it's it's

730
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:25,079
not cool or anything but it's funny I

731
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:27,570
thought it was funny anyway I mean

732
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,879
certainly we can like they do for work

733
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,879
put a VPN on there you know that's a

734
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:35,428
good way to do our security is VPN all

735
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:37,468
the devices into work so you know we we

736
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:39,059
have a secure connection but you know

737
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:41,609
the same way we could send them to say

738
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:44,009
my VPN so all their traffic is going

739
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:45,809
through you know my VPN tunnel and again

740
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:47,519
they're probably used to saying yes to

741
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:50,459
this because they did it when they set

742
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,319
up their work VPN the first time we're

743
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:54,779
literally doing the same thing we're

744
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,779
just asking them to install ours instead

745
00:29:54,779 --> 00:30:01,259
of works the where it gets I think

746
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:03,509
really scary is putting applications on

747
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:05,789
there and again this is how you know not

748
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:08,099
only jailbreaking applications but also

749
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:10,249
any of your mobile application

750
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:12,509
management in any of your corporate apps

751
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:15,539
anything like that are put on the

752
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:17,519
devices they have their their Enterprise

753
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:19,169
developer certificate again it's not

754
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,669
particularly hard to get one you just

755
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:23,399
basically have to do a couple of phone

756
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:25,379
calls with Apple and give them like your

757
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:27,448
stuff about your business and whatnot

758
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:28,829
and then you get them like said if the

759
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:30,719
jailbreakers and the security

760
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:34,619
researchers can get them it's not

761
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:36,209
particularly hard so it's the same thing

762
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:38,158
here if you want to install an

763
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:40,769
application that did not go through the

764
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,529
Apple App Store you have to put a

765
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:46,229
developer certificate on it but again

766
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:48,599
the user is just prompted to say yes

767
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:50,029
they've probably again done it before

768
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,158
for their mobile application management

769
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:55,379
so if your social engineer them into

770
00:30:53,159 --> 00:31:01,889
thinking it's part of that then they're

771
00:30:55,379 --> 00:31:04,439
probably likely to say yes again so yeah

772
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:06,478
you can just this just in your Xcode

773
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,269
when you're building this stuff just put

774
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:11,519
your own developer profile on there like

775
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:13,649
host it somewhere and then you know

776
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,329
social engineer people into downloading

777
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:17,099
it it prompts them to accept the

778
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:20,969
certificate again like they're always

779
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:22,468
asked at their work anyway and then you

780
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:24,119
know they've run your application again

781
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:25,049
it didn't go through the App Store and

782
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,418
certainly

783
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:29,519
it's not as bad as Android in terms of

784
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,860
like once you have an app on there you

785
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,950
don't even have to like exploit it

786
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,559
because all of the permissions that

787
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,899
applications can ask for are like really

788
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:41,879
scary they can get everything about the

789
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,590
device it's not quite as bad on the

790
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:47,488
Apple side they don't really just let

791
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:49,678
you completely run amok but there are a

792
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:52,019
lot of permissions you can ask for on

793
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,090
the Apple side that they'd probably be

794
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:56,190
likely to stop you if you went through

795
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,539
the App Store but since you're not going

796
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,999
through the App Store you know you can

797
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:01,999
just use them to steal there so you may

798
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:04,559
not even need to do you know additional

799
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:09,090
exploitation from that point once you've

800
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,859
got an app on the device so yeah these

801
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,600
are just like pictures about how to do

802
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:14,428
it again there's a white paper if you

803
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,709
want to do it I mean basically it's just

804
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:19,259
you know you sign it with your your

805
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:21,659
development certificate instead of

806
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:23,399
sending it through the app store and it

807
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:26,159
sends it with it of course there are

808
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:29,070
ways to automate this flag this is a

809
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,159
free tool I made will automate all of it

810
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:34,590
there is a pro version but in order to

811
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,269
do any like security research type stuff

812
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,129
you don't need the pro version you just

813
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:42,869
need the free version so you can do all

814
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:45,269
this in the free version um so you know

815
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:46,649
to avoid having to like set any of this

816
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:49,080
up like setting up the social

817
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:50,488
engineering or setting up the profile

818
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,869
you can actually just click some buttons

819
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:57,989
in my little tool but the main point

820
00:32:54,869 --> 00:33:00,029
being like why I put this in here is so

821
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:02,879
once you've got an application on their

822
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:05,609
device again we sent it in with the

823
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:07,529
profiles so we avoided the App Store we

824
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,840
social engineered them into installing a

825
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,830
wrap the same they way they would

826
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,168
anything through their mobile

827
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,168
application management and now we can

828
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:17,820
just you know use

829
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:21,519
the built-in API is in the application

830
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:24,730
to like steal stuff off the device like

831
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:28,720
we can get a list of the applications we

832
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:30,970
can like download and upload files mess

833
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,600
with Bluetooth get their text messages

834
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:37,659
get their call records contact location

835
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,668
things like that so again it's well it's

836
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:42,460
not as bad as Android you can certainly

837
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:44,799
do a lot of stuff just with the built-in

838
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,730
api's but if you do want to go a little

839
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,539
bit further

840
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:52,200
certainly as new versions of iOS come

841
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:55,059
out very quickly they become jailbroken

842
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,970
because people want to jailbreak their

843
00:33:55,059 --> 00:34:00,129
devices and a lot of times the code even

844
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,139
becomes public for the GL breaks like

845
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:03,908
Google project zeroes generally pretty

846
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:06,369
good about putting proof of concept code

847
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:08,020
out there so certainly you know the bad

848
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:09,339
guys are using it but the good guys are

849
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,399
using it as well for things like

850
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:15,219
penetration testing to see you know

851
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,649
whether your devices are vulnerable so

852
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:20,138
you can once you have an application on

853
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:22,449
the device do local privilege escalation

854
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,669
exactly like how the jailbreaking apps

855
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:26,949
work except install eight instead of

856
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:28,839
installing Cydia you know if I was bad

857
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:31,569
guy I would you know steal all your data

858
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:33,399
if I was a penetration tester I would

859
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,558
just pretend I was stealing all your

860
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,529
data to help you like fix your problems

861
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,839
but certainly like a lot of they're like

862
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,149
jailbreak detections actually which

863
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:45,069
again this is kind of another talk will

864
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:47,618
actually just like check for the Cydia

865
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:49,389
app store which is what aji oberek

866
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:51,429
typically gives you but if it's an

867
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:53,619
actual attacker who's giving a brute

868
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:57,040
access to your device to like steal your

869
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:59,859
iOS keychain for example like there's

870
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,619
the iOS keychain stole it all got root

871
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:05,140
privileges they don't need a third party

872
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:07,420
app store they just want to get root

873
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,759
access and like steal what they want to

874
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,760
steal so like you can't get the iOS

875
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,760
keychain except like the entries that

876
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,010
belong to your particular app by default

877
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,690
but if your root you can you know with

878
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,580
some finagling do pretty much anything

879
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,800
so like

880
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,990
it's just an example of you know if I

881
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,170
get root privileges through basically

882
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:30,149
repurposing jailbreak code then I'm able

883
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,330
to do even more scary stuff so if

884
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:35,910
there's not an API through like the the

885
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:37,620
Apple API is to like steal the keychain

886
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:40,080
for instance because that would be bad

887
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,880
once you got root access to it I mean

888
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,819
it's really just a Linux system under

889
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,070
there so certainly you can do things

890
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,470
there so you know the point being that

891
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:52,110
certainly Enterprise profiles are not

892
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:54,480
going to go away we need them because

893
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:57,900
otherwise we'd be stuck in mobile

894
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,270
antivirus Landwehr then you know it

895
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,160
scans itself and that's the extent to

896
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:04,320
what is able to know about the security

897
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,359
of the device which since we don't

898
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,400
control the devices ourselves we really

899
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,680
need it more than that so it was really

900
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,260
nice of Apple to give us this ability to

901
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,399
you know get people to configure things

902
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:19,110
like VPN at our SSL certs put our own

903
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,030
applications on there often security

904
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,590
applications but things that are

905
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,090
controlled by our mobile application

906
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,340
management I mean I'm not saying that

907
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,140
these things should go away but I'm just

908
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:30,930
pointing out that I mean they can be

909
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,549
used by attackers and you know that's I

910
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,649
feel like really been overlooked like

911
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,510
nobody's doing any you know security

912
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:39,180
testing on this when people are doing

913
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,840
their security testing for like social

914
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,000
engineering

915
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,400
you know the let's be honest they're not

916
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,350
even testing for text messages most of

917
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,970
the time and you know they're certainly

918
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:50,460
not checking to see whether someone

919
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,560
would install a malicious profile or

920
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,570
missed all and a malicious application

921
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,970
that would then you know give up access

922
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:59,370
to the iOS keychain or you know any

923
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,629
other secret data it's like you know

924
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:02,549
some of the mobile application

925
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,740
management is actually store like their

926
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:08,400
you know management passwords in plain

927
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,379
text in the iOS keychain just saying but

928
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,270
you know I have a penetration tester so

929
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,190
I mean I'm not telling you all of this

930
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,470
so you can go out and like attack

931
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:19,050
people's phones and things you know the

932
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:21,390
point being that if you are part of you

933
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:24,510
know a security program or in any way

934
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:27,680
have any like access to being able to

935
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:29,599
change policy at all like run scream

936
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,160
and say that you know one we need to

937
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,180
include mobility in our security

938
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,129
programs a lot of times it's just

939
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,290
ignored you know as a penetration test

940
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:41,390
or you know eye pin test people's apps

941
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,640
but you know hardly ever does anybody

942
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,700
want to bring bring your own device or

943
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:49,730
IOT or any of that stuff into the

944
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:53,299
security testing and they really need to

945
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:55,280
because bad guys don't stop doing things

946
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,140
that are bad just because it's out of

947
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,420
scope that you know they don't believe

948
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,578
in scope and this is particularly

949
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,640
problematic because it's changing so

950
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:06,470
rapidly when you think about you know my

951
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,578
original like blue box

952
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:12,379
network diagram and your topology every

953
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:14,390
network wasn't gonna change that much

954
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,490
yeah a machine might die and it might

955
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,980
get replaced but you know with the

956
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,839
mobile devices and the IOT and cloud

957
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,059
services and things like that they're

958
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:24,920
changing so incredibly rapidly like

959
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:26,660
somebody drops their phone in the toilet

960
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,790
over the weekend and you've got a whole

961
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,980
new device with a whole new security

962
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,839
posture that came on just over the

963
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,270
weekend and you know multiply that by

964
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:37,849
how many employees you have and you know

965
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:39,859
you have a real problem here so one the

966
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:42,290
mobile devices really really need to be

967
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,029
in your security program they need to be

968
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,430
monitored they need to be scanned

969
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,140
they need to be penetration tested they

970
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,629
absolutely need to be part of your

971
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,400
social engineering they you know you

972
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,589
need to be doing more than just like

973
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,720
don't click on links and emails you need

974
00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:59,210
to be sending text messages putting up

975
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,368
rogue QR codes you know any of these

976
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,380
sending things over whatsapp or facebook

977
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:05,420
Messenger and you need to be you know

978
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,819
sending more than oh that link got

979
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,980
clicked you need to be like simulating

980
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:11,750
things like this cuz it can be really

981
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,760
scary you have something like this you

982
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,859
know in your enterprise and there's

983
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,720
nothing checking for it it looks normal

984
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:20,119
to the user because they did it twelve

985
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,759
other times for you know their mobile

986
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,589
application management and you know they

987
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,890
just so happened to install something

988
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:29,750
that came from bad guy X and you know if

989
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:32,710
you haven't tested against it there's

990
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,839
nothing to monitor for it so you

991
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:37,119
look and we need to do a lot better

992
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:39,250
because this is a huge huge

993
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,890
vulnerability so it's also kind of fun

994
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,720
because it's like oh let's just use you

995
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:45,430
know this stuff they built for security

996
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,759
purposes to you know mess with the

997
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:51,220
devices so you know that's that's my

998
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,020
little talk it was rejected by

999
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,509
blackheads to me it wasn't that great

1000
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,220
after all but you know thank you guys

1001
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,349
for your time I've really enjoyed it

1002
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,839
here in Nepal like I said I have

1003
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:03,940
business cards but they do have to run

1004
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,710
to the airport because somehow I have to

1005
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,500
be in the eg UPS by tomorrow to give a

1006
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,790
talk and get my 6th continent so thank

1007
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,960
you guys for your time I really

1008
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,300
appreciate it

1009
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,400

1010
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,400
