1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,960


2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,320


3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,940
Thank you for being a

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,360


5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,029


6
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:26,250
ferocious guest.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,940
It's been a long time since

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,040
I

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,630
've been in the middle of a long time, but I've been in the middle of a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time I've been in the middle of a long time since I've been in the middle of

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:46,050


11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,200
a long time  It's really a

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,079


13
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,520


14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,220


15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,880
medicinal herb.

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,770
I'm going to talk about the last thing with a feeling that it's

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,439
quite an extreme creation

18
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,670


19
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,450
, so it

20
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,130
's a Sunni faction, so it's already a really strong drink.  It's because the people in the room

21
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,860
don't restrain themselves after restraining

22
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,470


23
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,060


24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,520


25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,210


26
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:52,150


27
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,010
themselves.

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,870


29
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:15,860


30
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,720


31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,170


32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,360
I don't really understand Arai-san, there are various profiles in various places, and I don't really know which

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,680


34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,710
one to use. There are eight stores in Shirahama.  It's the most recent sumo award,

35
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,730
ah, isn't it

36
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,080


37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,730


38
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,660


39
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,150


40
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,200
?  It was today, the

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,340
head priest Hyogakki is in the middle of the infantry method

42
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,540


43
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:08,160
Job hunting for university graduates.

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,370


45
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,400


46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,480


47
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,670
I mean, well, I don't have a choice, right?

48
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,590
Naan, when I was

49
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,380
reading the Kamatama Chunichi Shimbun, I was a college student, and

50
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,500
that person named Myung Miwa Tsuyoshi was imprinted on me.

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,380


52
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,740
There was a person who started a security business, but if everyone would join me, I would

53
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:45,010
be on board, and I would like to start from now on.  It was written about security on the Internet, and

54
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,920
it seemed interesting, so I applied for the first time.

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,730


56
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,920


57
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,490


58
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,150


59
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,360
I've been living here for a while,

60
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,890
but it's

61
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,640


62
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,329
amazing when I come back.

63
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,660
It just

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,360
happened to be thin, so yes, I didn't really have a

65
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,550
choice, but I thought it would be interesting.

66
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:38,569


67
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,899
Shuhei Kagi said something earlier, is

68
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:45,810


69
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,260


70
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,320
that true?  Sometimes it's

71
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,790
Newin's study that

72
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,050
wins, so it's a tool that says you can drop windows, or a pan screen thread

73
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,660
Yes Yes,

74
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,070
there are various ways to use it.

75
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,110


76
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,650


77
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,380


78
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,850
It's funny if you go out and go to see that other wife, so

79
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,280
no

80
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,520


81
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,840
, I'm sorry for being

82
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,980


83
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,980


84
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:58,950
pretentious.  Also, Arai-san, I'm getting more and more people drinking alcohol, and I'm going to start

85
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,770
pou dou dou.

86
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:11,849


87
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:18,380
Ero-san,

88
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,180
I think it's super nostalgic, but it shoots through

89
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,010
.

90
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,009


91
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,770


92
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,360


93
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,840


94
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,160
But

95
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,139


96
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:50,680
when I entered the company, there weren't many trees, so it would have been easier to count from the bottom.

97
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,610


98
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,550
The number of bosses

99
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:05,450
Arbiter Dylas writes or Ona everyone who is not afraid of being in the same

100
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,250
place Are you using that relaxation?

101
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,090


102
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,350


103
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,630
There are a lot of people who think that they can do what they can do faster or higher than

104
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,370


105
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,410


106
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,330
that.

107
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,530
It seems like there's no all-out battle, ai

108
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,249
Yeah, when

109
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:40,309
I joined the company, it's

110
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,550


111
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,060


112
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,240


113
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,780


114
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,790


115
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,480
Code Blue in Chapter 4, but he's amazing as a moderator.  I was wondering if I should call the review board

116
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,210
, but it was the first time there was a panel for a week, so I

117
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,810
thought, ah, Tomoko is amazing

118
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,419


119
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:12,620
.  It's a program so far,

120
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,200
but it's not a burning thing to bring something back to the participants as content, so

121
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,719
it's not a village

122
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,780
.  Partly because it's remote, it

123
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,710
's

124
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:39,110
true that it's better to put in a guy with a slightly different taste than arranging real technical or gel

125
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,979


126
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,200
lessons, but I've got that, so I'll do it.  Well, no matter where I look, there's always a

127
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,630
Nelly View Board waiting for me

128
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,660


129
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,230


130
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,930
.  I'll say it once, but it's

131
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,010
useless to be supported by

132
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,350
him.

133
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,540


134
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,350


135
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:28,880
From that point on, I just ended up with Hatego-san, who

136
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,110
felt like

137
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:38,080
he did

138
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,100
n't say something great.

139
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,610


140
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,880
That's right, after that you went to the United States, right?

141
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,000
It's been about five years since the company, so if I go back to that

142
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,120


143
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,029
time, I went beyond the security situation with the rack at that time.

144
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,570


145
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:24,930


146
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:30,450


147
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:39,810
It's okay to be quiet

148
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,130


149
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,420
I'm sure it's my fault

150
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:52,390
I'm traveling if someone can see the tone

151
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,130


152
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,570


153
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,730
I started looking for

154
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,339
something like an abandoned school, but he

155
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:11,290
didn't try hard, he found that windows-based vulnerability, didn't he?

156
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:17,670


157
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:36,440


158
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,530
It's

159
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,970
probably a real pride, or rather, it's like a listening game, isn't

160
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,610
it?

161
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,840


162
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,840


163
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,050
Near Virginia,

164
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,920


165
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,160
but it feels good and fair, is

166
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,690


167
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,270


168
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,600


169
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,850


170
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,449
n't it?

171
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:40,720


172
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,480
I think it would be

173
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,470
great to do something like going to America.

174
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,270


175
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,740
You know, I've collected a lot of Japanese I mean, I

176
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,150
don't speak ahh, so

177
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,850
let's get

178
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:08,209
on the dj Even if I meet someone on TV, it feels like it's in English, so when I went home, I kind of forgot about Japanese, didn't I?

179
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:08,959


180
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,059


181
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:14,119
Well, that's with

182
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:18,499
Nagatomo, for example, a soccer player like

183
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,230


184
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,950
that

185
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:29,500
.  I don't understand English from the first day,

186
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,730
but I don't have Japanese 6

187
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,830
I see. Didn't you want to draw a picture together

188
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,940


189
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:46,010
?  That's right, so the

190
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,560
place I live

191
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,870
in

192
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:57,680
is called Pentagon City, but it's only about a mile away from Soja City, so when I

193
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,640


194
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:05,730
woke up in the morning, there was a terrific sound of collision without a crash.

195
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,390


196
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:17,840
I wondered what this was about, and then the scene returned to normal  Well, I'm back, so it's okay,

197
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,780
but when I go to the office in silence, the TV is always not on, and

198
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,769
smoke is billowing from Echin Tower, and

199
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:32,499
about a minute after that, the second term rushes in, haha, and I'm

200
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:38,619
down.  Even though it's on cnn, why is it from Prada, which is in the bottom part

201
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:39,939


202
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:43,030


203
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,150


204
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:50,040
?

205
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:58,370


206
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,499


207
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:04,849


208
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:09,159
I got a call from someone and was worried that

209
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,540
you were okay.

210
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,830
I thought it was so far away in the sky, right

211
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:23,340


212
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,670


213
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:31,020


214
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,020
?  Hey, it's an

215
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,150
image, isn't

216
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,740
it? Right now, I don't know what it is.

217
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,830


218
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,970


219
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,449


220
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:52,760


221
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,080


222
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,110


223
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,620
Ukai-san, a [ __ ] who was on the panel discussion on the review board yesterday with my friend, was spotted by

224
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,040
a colleague of the Naa issue

225
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,730
, but

226
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,190
at the time of booby,

227
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,520
American TV stations all at once said it.

228
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:23,540
Mr. Ukai's

229
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,740


230
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,040


231
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,310
great idea Tim Roth is the president, or rather, the chief.  That's why, because of conspiracies, the level of Japanese television is absolutely nothing

232
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,950
like that, but it's fine.

233
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,240
Society is good these days

234
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,270


235
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,370


236
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:50,600
.  Look, wasn't South Korea half down or something like that

237
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,759


238
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:13,750


239
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,530


240
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,209


241
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:23,250
?  But

242
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,260


243
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,500
ah, the glass that took me a year is 125 or so

244
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,030


245
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,530
It's

246
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:39,380
empty, isn't it?

247
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,710


248
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:49,180


249
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:54,250
Well, you know, fileless, or something like that, a slightly different type of thing has come out, and it

250
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,929
feels like there's

251
00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:01,179
quite a lot of threat theories going around.

252
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,320


253
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,540


254
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:11,280
That guy in the rainy season, like

255
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,100
Jaguar Data, is like Pock, or rather,

256
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,190


257
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:22,159
like the current virus, it's a highly perfected behavior that considers vulnerabilities

258
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:24,320


259
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,429
.  In other

260
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:32,279
words, it's an oversight violation for the sole purpose of spreading the infection, isn't it?

261
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,499


262
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:37,730


263
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,100


264
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,480


265
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,440
Well, that's

266
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,429
right, so from there, windows xp came out, and there was a system that did the overtones

267
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:55,770
and

268
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,640
the dept in the header.

269
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,690
I thought it started to change a little from that

270
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,610


271
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,630


272
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,150
point on.

273
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,299


274
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:15,680


275
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,950
back to xp

276
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,820
Oh yeah, I was told something

277
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,900
I wish I couldn't download hard when I was in Iwami I

278
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,799
'm

279
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:26,630


280
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,340
drinking because

281
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,540
I'm a

282
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,510


283
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:42,150
biter.  Is it true that the 2nd layer of that area has steadily entered the

284
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,250


285
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:50,690


286
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:57,410
os?  That's why, when

287
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,059
I really started, I was just looking for security holes or vulnerabilities, but

288
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:07,350
from that time on, I thought I'd try a little malware, so it's like I'm going to research it.

289
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,990


290
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,429
something like this

291
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,539
It's not like I'm creating a vulnerability in Ganju, and

292
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,510
since then I've accepted commands and things like that, so it's completely cool.

293
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,670


294
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,840


295
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,240


296
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,840


297
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,110


298
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,770
It was around 2000 that

299
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,890
it was like a concept

300
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:50,310


301
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,030


302
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,460
model.  No, I'll

303
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,930


304
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,650
try to research a little more.

305
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:02,180
Thanks to you, Rina Fujita, who bought an rs and changed jobs to that trend micro

306
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,900


307
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,290
.  I

308
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,550
don't

309
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,540


310
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,530
have it. I carried it with the people at the dd research institute and the dentist.

311
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,000


312
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,130


313
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,580


314
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,309
East Japan

315
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:30,690
Oh,

316
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,790
strangely, I want to find out if there's something I can do

317
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,150


318
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,440


319
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,029
a little more.  It's quite a shock to be separated from Mr. Raku.

320
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:54,830


321
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,269


322
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:03,370
It's a big career, no

323
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:22,650


324
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,030
, no, no, it's something like this, even at home

325
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,830
.

326
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,890


327
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,570
The numbers that are collected by the whole house of Amazing

328
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,299
Yonomaru are big data

329
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,639


330
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:49,629


331
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:50,619
.

332
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,450


333
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,700
Aamu Trend 1 If I hadn't joined the company, I think I would have been really interested in AI and deep learning

334
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,929


335
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:59,040


336
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,360
.

337
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,900


338
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,010


339
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,030
I think there is overtime work.

340
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:19,130
I wanted to do it within the scope of what I

341
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,270
could do, and I thought I had to automatically process my favorite data

342
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,710


343
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,350


344
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:28,830
.

345
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:32,580
That's why I'm starting to write

346
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:38,200
about the effects, or

347
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,090


348
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:48,179
rather, I started to share Reimu Reimu.  It

349
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:49,529
may have been after I entered the trend

350
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,490
Ah,

351
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,419
Hatori left,

352
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:53,799
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

353
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,580


354
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,730


355
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,240


356
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,169
ah  When it comes out, I'm going to

357
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:09,520
write it, and

358
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,280
Philo and I are quite a lot after that, so yeah, it was just around that time

359
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,050


360
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:25,370


361
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,450
.  Is

362
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,840
it possible to use it for free for things like collaboration and my own registration

363
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:42,010


364
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,010


365
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,720


366
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,409
?  It

367
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,950
's

368
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,299
a restrained man's performance.

369
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:02,950


370
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,370


371
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:13,000
If you have computing power, you'll have trouble writing an answer right away.

372
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,050


373
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,390


374
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,060


375
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,630
You can buy a match-up honeypot if

376
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,630
it's a cloud-like relationship

377
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,400
.

378
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,190


379
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,570


380
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,630
No, yeah,

381
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:54,080
yeah, yeah, I'm still attached to that, but yeah,

382
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,480
yeah, it's not that I don't understand the feeling of being frustrated, right?

383
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480


384
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,870


385
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:14,200
And more or less

386
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,650
I

387
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,350
don't know, but why is it so nice to see the

388
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,960
cloud too

389
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,149
? It's been amazing lately.

390
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:34,380


391
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,020
So I always have to try using salt.

392
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:46,640


393
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,110


394
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,530


395
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,820
That's why I'm saying it, but it's getting better and better, is

396
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,299


397
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:09,920
n't it?

398
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,559
It's been a long time since I've seen it in various ways, and

399
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,720
now it's amazing that both exist.

400
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:25,430


401
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,980
Using machine learning to make the

402
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:35,880
following 20 seconds, or rather, pipe craftsmen are beginning to exist.

403
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,360


404
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,720


405
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,540


406
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,710


407
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:52,970
But hey, you see, I still have a sense of a yellow person to

408
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,570


409
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:02,179


410
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:07,879
some extent.  Being able to verbalize it is, after all,

411
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:13,369
I think that making a model is the strongest

412
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:19,129


413
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:24,499
thing.  That's why I think

414
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:27,870
people who can connect the two are

415
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,650
colors, and

416
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,290


417
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:39,200
I really think so.  Or, if

418
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,399
someone like a translator or coordinator

419
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,450
doesn't play an active role, it's impossible

420
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:51,090
to connect people with deep knowledge in that specialty.

421
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,330


422
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,130


423
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,670


424
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:06,360
We're in an era where we can't just collaborate with the experts we've imposed on them, and they can't rotate.

425
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,080
After all, I'm influenced by that kind of feeling, and

426
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,390
I think it's becoming that way.

427
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,919


428
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,000


429
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,340


430
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:29,010
In fact, there were many reports

431
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:36,600
that there was no one to properly connect the company's voice to the manufacturer's research shutter, or the person who oversees it, or the management judge, so

432
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,990


433
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,879


434
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:44,499
Kaho increased.  People who do chain moxibustion who say it's totally better.

435
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:45,770


436
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,290


437
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,520


438
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,620


439
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,680
Yeah, there's no

440
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,860


441
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:05,760
producers who can coordinate

442
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,490
that champ.I wanted more people like

443
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,580


444
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,470
that

445
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,600


446
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,940
.  I don't think you can do it unless you have the ability to produce

447
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,210


448
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,510


449
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:36,039
.

450
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:41,320
You have to buy the project and collect the source of the

451
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,259
data, and you have to create a system to collect the data.

452
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:53,289
I

453
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:54,009


454
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:56,029


455
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:59,989
have to do it, I have to do it, and I have to do it.It exists, but I can do everything by combining au.It's

456
00:30:59,989 --> 00:31:03,800
become a pretty big project, but I

457
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:09,380
need one or eight to be able to produce it, isn't it

458
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,240
?  It's really reassuring

459
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,670
to be able to leave Andy's troublesome work to each

460
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,789
other.

461
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:29,039
That

462
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,820


463
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,639
's different, but is it like the eyes of someone who is good at it?

464
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,280


465
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,240


466
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,970


467
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,010


468
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:49,410
I think

469
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,800


470
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,850
Hmmm Paso is a zone slow amateur association training thank you

471
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,030
Excuse me, I wonder if I should go through the soup Hey,

472
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,820


473
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,730
I wonder if No. 5 is okay Hmmm, what

474
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,220
is it?

475
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,820


476
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:23,559
There are almost no things to fix, and after all, children who have researched in their own way and

477
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:26,919
re-tailored it

478
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:31,299
to that certainty and announce it and get

479
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:35,710
feedback.What do you call an ecosystem?  So, as you

480
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,879
get

481
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,670
older, you'll get feedback, and you'll wonder if you can make a great

482
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,250
product.

483
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,509


484
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,310


485
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:57,390


486
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,370


487
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,030
[Music]

488
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:19,510
Booby or away You can get a good dog I didn't come to the tour

489
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,540
Queen

490
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:20,780


491
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,310


492
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:33,440
In order to do so, I think there is probably an academic perspective, but after

493
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,250
all, you create opportunities for yourself to put up that kind of feedback, and

494
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,940
you

495
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,570
listen to various things.

496
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,980
When I

497
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,980
say that I really want to stick to this,

498
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,110


499
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:03,549
I feel like I can get away from it that much.

500
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:04,880


501
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,580


502
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:12,020


503
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,379


504
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:17,699
That's why I want to seize as many opportunities as possible to break out of my shell It

505
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,668
's the same with the fact that it's like e, and I

506
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:24,960
guess I'm the one who writes papers I don't have an

507
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,139
image, so if you think that admission is a saucer,

508
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:37,969
but in the end, it's before morning  There are many things written in papers from various

509
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:44,090
times

510
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,800


511
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,099
, right

512
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:56,980
?  It's not much from Mr. Teruzu, so it's me, so there's a lot of firsts

513
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,070


514
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,720
.

515
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,290


516
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:10,240


517
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,619
I was told this

518
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:22,230
Well then, there is that academic longs Osugi has to explain everything in the eight pages of that academic journal, and

519
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,130
it's amazing that

520
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:33,940
he can explain it to people who don't know his area of ​​expertise.  I have to write about it in a very gray

521
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,150
color. New

522
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:41,650
sake is amazing in the morning.

523
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:46,030


524
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:52,960
If you

525
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,280
let go, you'll come to realize that the number of readers is the number of readers

526
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,250
, is

527
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:07,030
n't it

528
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,070
?  Run a little

529
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:14,560
, I see. It's about being conscious of the reader,

530
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,840
isn't it?

531
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,680


532
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,510
Hey, how many times have you had a marathon at university now?

533
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,690


534
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:39,250


535
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,099


536
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:52,700
The people who are doing research on the ingredients of soaps and the ingredients of modifiers

537
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,369
are also amazing when they hear Chen 9's announcement and rush into it.

538
00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:59,269


539
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:02,609


540
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:06,420
Shiina, who speaks

541
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,650


542
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:12,490
with all her might, and when you say that you have to ask a question about something that's pretty dark

543
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:19,000
, you've been waiting too long, so if you're in a weak position, why don't you practice as a prefectural color

544
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,950
?  The exchanges were also

545
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:44,940


546
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,540
really fun.

547
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:53,390


548
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,450


549
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,170
Such people's homes are gathered at the salon,

550
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,609


551
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:05,829
and if

552
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:09,700
you make time to talk about your own research or dare to donate blood, it's good to have time to have discussions and

553
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,369
interact there again.

554
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:14,460


555
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,390
It's going to be, but

556
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:25,520
because of the background of receiving various ideas, it seems that you can get a region like that,

557
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,180
so I'm going to leave it all out.  I'm saying something I don't want to say,

558
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,830
but

559
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,550
uhm

560
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:42,030
, gamer Seiai, let's say that before, the research institute and him are more or less

561
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,480
consciously incorporating that sort of thing, isn't it

562
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,060
?

563
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,300
That's why I got the hang of it, and on

564
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,010
the surface of the journal, I was put on L'

565
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,440


566
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,140


567
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,800
Occitane.

568
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,690
It's

569
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,990


570
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:21,970
not that Hankyu is about the vulnerability itself

571
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,960
, but explaining it to people is research Rhonda, and that's what academics are

572
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,250
all about.

573
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,750


574
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:43,380
That's a lot of money, that president who experienced a lot of money

575
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,700
[Music]

576
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,950
No, oh

577
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,480
Well, I have to get a copter,

578
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,410
so there are problems with things like the river law,

579
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:01,160
but love is hard, right

580
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:08,440


581
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,850
?  I thought it would be the last time I lost an offensive person.

582
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:20,030


583
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,210


584
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,589


585
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:23,880


586
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,350


587
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:33,070
There are a lot of people who work hard and interact with each other, aren't there

588
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,340


589
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:41,890


590
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:46,340


591
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,280


592
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,369


593
00:40:51,369 --> 00:41:08,680
?  Or even if I love it,

594
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:14,230
there's one thing I wonder if the problem is really a vulnerability in

595
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:20,630
Buber.

596
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,230


597
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,410
Secondly, well, Ronbu, as a

598
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:31,350
result, we achieved something like 98%

599
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:35,700
, so compared to the processing all the time, it went up by 3%, for example.

600
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,809


601
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:44,799
2% of the 5th place

602
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:47,360
say something like this algorithm jazz can't cover  That

603
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:53,360
being said, the 2% vulnerability is a little confusing, and it's

604
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,840
not a standard for that kind of bridge.

605
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:03,440
Microsoft made a

606
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,380
mitre ah fluffy maker, but I

607
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,710
think it's very good as a vermicelli, and

608
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:16,800
1 I think it's very good as a framework as an organized model.

609
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,150
There are a few things that

610
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,610


611
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:30,960


612
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,329


613
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:40,660


614
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:45,920
are connected to each other.  I think it's still a topic for discussion in the future, but that's why it's

615
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,549
finally starting to come as if I've seen the entrance to the bottom

616
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:53,329


617
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:59,530
.

618
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:05,800
That's right, this is the first thing, isn't it? We're still discussing it, so it's time for me to attack and hype,

619
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,900
isn't

620
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,170
it

621
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,220
okay?

622
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,849
However,

623
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:22,510
the other party is an algorithm, and it's because

624
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,980
they're treating that story like a black box.

625
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,839


626
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:29,809


627
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:35,209


628
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:36,710


629
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,960
But if you think about things like ceramics that reduce the existence value of the algorithm itself, it

630
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:49,420
will have more impact and if

631
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,610
it's an attack, I

632
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:59,950
'd say it's fine.  The cherry blossoms that I thought after listening to people's stories I

633
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,490


634
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:05,660
wonder what it is, isn't it a variety of algorithms bars?

635
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,250


636
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:16,150


637
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,350


638
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:22,480
If

639
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,990
you can make an algorithm like change 1,

640
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,510
it's probably

641
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:34,930
because you don't live in a place that makes you

642
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,800


643
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,109
miss it.  It's in the middle of the day, isn't it?

644
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:45,700


645
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,089


646
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:51,109


647
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:53,719


648
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:59,390


649
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,630
I'm going to do this, see

650
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:03,880
you soon.

651
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:09,970
After all, it's a debug confrontation Adrais, and it's about sorting out attack methods

652
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:10,720


653
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,480


654
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,090


655
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,820


656
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,310
.

657
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,849
I think there are many

658
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:30,970
, but in the end, if the debugging process was organized live,

659
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,509


660
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:37,700


661
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,079
it should lead to the creation of algorithms and models that can clear all of them, but the

662
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,029
final goal is that.  Isn't it

663
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:47,749
er

664
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:06,690
Bubuonhoquati I've been saying that since this time I've been saying that I'm

665
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,270


666
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,420
going to go to 2000 with the sauce

667
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,309
.

668
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:19,619


669
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:20,970


670
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:36,390
No matter how many times I catch a catch, it's already pretty good, but it's sake I'm 22 years old.

671
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:37,730


672
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,570


673
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:50,160
Shidore Sports Gold final episode

674
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,190
No, there's

675
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,560
Koryoku Destruction Yes Yes 2

676
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:00,230
That's it I have a book at the end of the bar's cell and Mr. Arai It's amazing

677
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,779
I'm already angry at the house

678
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:06,080


679
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,280
I'm quite a collector

680
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:15,230
It's old, isn't it? It's the sound you get, so I was the one who wrote it first.

681
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:19,580


682
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,380


683
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,170


684
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,960
I

685
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,210


686
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:33,570
'm trying not to have Urahara-chan anymore, but line I understand myself, ahhhhh

687
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,890
[laughter]

688
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,700
1 Yes,

689
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,700
it was an accident at Mojiko

690
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,750


691
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,230


692
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:49,259
.  Is writing a

693
00:47:49,259 --> 00:47:53,660
home where you can do it without resistance during the big pool

694
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,990
? It's a difficult question.

695
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:02,730


696
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:06,530


697
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:13,520
In other words, if you just put that one line at the beginning, it

698
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:21,040
's amazing Clara.

699
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:27,940
But it doesn't really go away, it's the type that was common last summer,

700
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,359


701
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,610


702
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,230


703
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:41,420
isn't it?  Bouwa is a land called

704
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:48,770


705
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:52,960
Gajel.

706
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,480


707
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,970
Well, that's certainly true, but he's the kind of

708
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,930
person who writes serialized novels for newspapers

709
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:04,250


710
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:07,020
.

711
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:12,869


712
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:15,980
After all, the inside of my head is

713
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,819
something like

714
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:23,030
this.In Nantan, unless the Cosinapis is in a state where it is tightly connected, it can't be

715
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,760


716
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,770


717
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,200


718
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,240
lively.

719
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,510


720
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:41,480
I want to believe that it's only difficult for Iwaitei, if my

721
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,570
mother's editor

722
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:48,750


723
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:53,010


724
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:54,140
says so

725
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:59,269
After all, there are two kinds of game creators,

726
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:03,670
and if you read various interviews,

727
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:08,710
you'll find that there are 1 creators who can immerse themselves in the afterglow both during the writing process and

728
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:13,240
after making it.  You say you'll forget everything in an instant It's

729
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,390
three kinds Devon It's gorgeous I

730
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,750
finished making it, but it took

731
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,840


732
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:25,530
me a few hours to make a It's the type that I don't know what to do next

733
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:26,800
I see

734

[Music]

735
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:35,349
On the contrary I have one  Making a book has the meaning of something like studying yourself,

736
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:41,560
so I think there's also a car aspect, so that young person, or rather, people who are younger than me,

737
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:48,760
encourage me to do more and more books.  The implied by the recipient is Khan

738
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,089


739
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:56,670
Naedama, sorting it out as a family budget, and I'm a type like each other.

740
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,440


741
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,820
I'll look it up

742
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:04,820
yes yes If

743
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,740
it's just ctf, I'll solve the problem and do this, but

744
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,980
that authentic thing is meter I

745
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,620
wonder what psych  I mean, I

746
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,440


747
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,520
have access, so I'm going to talk about putting a pit in the same way.

748
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,520


749
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,300


750
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,750
People

751
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:39,110
who make or write books in the midst of that long-awaited glove,

752
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,180
I also go there.

753
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:47,180
I've already done it once, but

754
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,539
Junko See

755
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:54,569
you later, it's like we're going to do it again towards the end of the year.

756
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:59,459


757
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:03,880
For

758
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:09,099
those people who are

759
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:10,309


760
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:15,769
doing it, I've heard Mr. Arai's talks many times, and I've been quite involved.Is it really my son?

761
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:16,820


762
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,030
It

763
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:25,850
's quite fun to write while thinking about how I want this book to feel when it comes out.

764
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,460


765
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:36,110
The

766
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,020
number of people who want to do Secure 4a has increased, and they

767
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,750
're talking passionately about

768
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:48,420


769
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,650
it.

770
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,740


771
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,400


772
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,550
Well, I can definitely understand that kind of motivation and feeling. Well,

773
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:04,170
when Ogawa made Hanyu called Access Tan, it felt like that, but I can repair it with my

774
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,240
sharp head.

775

Kenja Neko Legends Day It's

776
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:14,890
not a change, but I'm afraid of these few verses

777
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,330


778
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:20,130

781
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:34,430
Actually, I'm delusional if I don't do a security pudu manga class this year

782
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:40,059
Actually, that's why the female doctor is Arai-san's not here, but

783
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:45,430
Arai-san's Arai's only Arai-san's Arai-san's Arai-san.

784
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,540


785
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:51,350
I've been here for about 15 years, but it's the first time I've

786
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,609
met you.

787
00:53:54,609 --> 00:53:59,390
It's been 2 years since I applied for a friend on cebook, and

788
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:04,280
it's been a year

789
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,430
.

790
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:11,530


791
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:15,380
I'm going to take a picture, and

792
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,710
I'm doing a project to make a cartoon of a clumsy production,

793
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:25,450
and somehow security plus cartoons

794
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:30,050
are kind of like comic ice, honestly, it's a

795
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:36,660
really good picture.  Well, I think there's something that didn't happen for a while, but during that time, I

796
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:45,000
've started a fairly expensive 5-person guy, so I'm going to transfer Mr. Kuri again

797
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,069


798
00:54:47,069 --> 00:54:51,329


799
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,210
.

800
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:56,260
I'm doing it again, but I

801
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,360
don't know what will happen.It's

802
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,810
just that Steve Jobs isn't it.

803
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:08,890


804
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,930


805
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:16,079
I remembered that it was fun to avoid it, and I came up with a

806
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,700
hypothesis that it might be a bad

807
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,660
word

808
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:27,240
.

809
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,160


810
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,619
I had it in mind, but if you did machine learning, you'd have to pay a lot of money for tuition, so

811
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:37,859
it's probably just

812
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:39,830
Sugaguchi.

813
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:44,840


814
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:50,560
I

815
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,020


816
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,270
really thought that if I thought I was having fun, I would get angry

817
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,759
and connect with

818
00:55:59,759 --> 00:56:00,950


819
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:06,500
Banman.  I sit down for two hours g

820
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,330
Hey

821
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,480
[Music]

822
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,369
Let's go to Rhea together I'm researching

823
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,890
First of all, the teacher isn't math

824
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:20,239


825
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:26,660
No, but it's called a model supermodel, and for the

826
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,500
first time

827
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:34,410
, there are ways to make use of mathematics

828
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:38,520


829
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,600


830
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,170
in that way.  In the first place,

831
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:46,270
I heard that there was such a high level of

832
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:50,800
interest in foreign dramas.

833
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:56,260
It seems to be Numbers, and I have to think that it might be from the United States.

834
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:06,430


835
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:10,599


836
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:12,010


837
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,560
I think it's interesting, it's

838
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,550
just a little bit.

839
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,980


840
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,369


841
00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:29,320

Susumu Yamaga,

843
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:37,190
I was also strongly recommended by Mr. Sonoda to read Aso, and it was very interesting.

844
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:41,130


845
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:46,609


846
00:57:46,609 --> 00:57:49,140
What is it that says that there is such a world?

847
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,260


848
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:57,029


849
00:57:57,029 --> 00:58:00,950


850
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:06,079
It's well thought out, isn't it? Well, of course, that's

851
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,540
why mathematics is a

852
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:15,460
complement to the drama's fun.

853
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:20,350
The model is also overlooked

854
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:24,510
After all, what is a therapist?

855
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:29,340


856
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,829


857
00:58:32,829 --> 00:58:36,630


858
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:42,349


859
00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:43,940
Thank you so much, everyone, thank you so much again

00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,589


861
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:55,660
Ah, again, Arai-san and I painted Shirahama's sushi and broke it, and it's town Takado Blue

862
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:03,160
, so everyone at the Code Blue place.  A

863
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,090


864
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:07,960
But the code army is a little more active on the review board 2. Well

865
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,500
, if you're having a hard time, it's super

866
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,770


867
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:14,990


868
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:17,050
okay.

869
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:21,610
I'm thankful, after all, I'm calling this, after all, it's a

870
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,010
defcon-like position,

871
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:29,200
and I met with everyone for the first time in a long time at a sled

872
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,830


873
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:35,810
and networked.  By all means

874
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:39,350
next year physical is already offline

875
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:43,190
To all of you, yes,

876
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:47,750
yes, I would like to close with that in mind.

877
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:52,089


878
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,819
