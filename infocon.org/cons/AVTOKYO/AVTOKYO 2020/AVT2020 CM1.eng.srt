00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,060
Mr. Dono, good evening, today is

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,300


3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,299


4
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:16,560


5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,210


6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,300
hello today.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,779


8
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,369


9
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:28,900
Today is 8

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,279
[music]

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:49,900
Boo Boo Online or eh Woods Dynasty or Imus a little Boo

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,210
Versati Bach I can't eat alcohol Today

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,470
with Kyon Kahn

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,420


15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,059
Well, this time it will be held online, so we will also sell goods online

16
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,070
The

17
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,259
site will be a little later,

18
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:19,429
but you can buy it from the inkstone 9 ab star in Tokyo that is on

19
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:23,200


20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,159


21
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,399
here.  If you think you can't make tofu here,

22
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,609
you're going to say it's amazing hey

23
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:40,179
90 types of daisies, 15 types, and

24
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:47,150
5 types of meat are a special set for sponsors

25
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,760
Yes, I asked for a can of 5000

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,510


27
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:00,409
I'm aiming for the added minutes I have a sponsor's t-shirt that is similar to the t-shirt I'm wearing now

28
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:05,540
.

29
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,270


30
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,740


31
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,100


32
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,820
By the way, I also bought a t-shirt, and when it

33
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,400
came out, the great thing about the inkstone was that we could choose the color of the t-shirt ourselves,

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,460


35
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,210
so I  It's white with a

36
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,280
white t-shirt, and the sizes for both women and men are exhausted, and there's a huge

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,420
variety of

38
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,480
sizes.  There are probably 10 different colors to

39
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,200
choose from, right

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,190
? I think there are 10 of each today.

41
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:01,030


42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,899


43
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,330
Patty Hey, this

44
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,630


45
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:27,130


46
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,170
is

47
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,840


48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,700
pretty.

49
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,130


50
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,140
One more card is full of power, isn't it?

51
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,170
Next, Nakata made a face that I thought I'd introduce to Bread's mother's house

52
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,720


53
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,040


54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,160


55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:10,570
.  There are no points from the t-shirt, and the back is the same as the t-shirt I mentioned earlier.

56
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,660
Yes,

57
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,959
the color

58
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,488
is rose.

59
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,220


60
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,350
It seems like it would be

61
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:34,240
fun to go abroad, but I'm not sure about the two overseas

62
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,420


63
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,390


64
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,370


65
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:05,860
projects.  What are you going to do with that much

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,039


67
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,369


68
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,480


69
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,970
?  It's

70
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,000
normal to wear a pot from the top

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,080


72
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,310


73
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,149
.
