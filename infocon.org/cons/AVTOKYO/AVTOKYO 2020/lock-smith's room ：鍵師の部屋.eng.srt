1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:24,439
Ah, ah, 100 sr, isn't it heavy?

2
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,520


3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,910


4
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,180


5
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,780
I have a qualification, um,

6
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,440
it's a little cut here and there's cement, so it's like a horse, isn't it?

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,510


8
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,620
I don't

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,710
think so, so

10
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,719
today I'd like to talk about why I took this picture, what it's like to start, and so on.

11
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,070


12
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,960
It

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,420
looks like it's going to be extremely hot upstairs. It's like an 8 ration rest, and it's a vulnerability diagnosis.

14
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,840


15
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:35,080


16
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,160


17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,790


18
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,540


19
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,540
My name is Ogre, and

20
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,410
I'm also in charge of

21
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,550
the Jojo test

22
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:57,960


23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,020
.  It's not like this

24
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:09,128
, but I often think that it's all mixed

25
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:13,020
up at home.

26
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,320
First of all, the company is a little different from 4, which has nothing to do,

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,120
but in

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,630
general, the goal is customers and

29
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,730
customers who provide services for consumers.  If there was one, it would be for Honshu.

30
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,940


31
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:53,000


32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,520


33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:06,320
Of course,

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,710
there is a cyber part of the customer,

35
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,160
but among them,

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,290
I would like to try it, but I haven't been able to do it until now.

37
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,049


38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:41,130


39
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,430


40
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,239
It's a group of people who are involved in the situation, and

41
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,830
each company is diagnosed with

42
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:56,400
the technology that affects it.  I don't think there's a slight difference in strength, so

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,310
I'd like to see the technical skills improve, and the sound that will make the customer hold their breath properly.

44
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,230


45
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,840


46
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,440
After all, another goal is that what we are

47
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,139


48
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:38,690
testing is sleeping.

49
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,010


50
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,860
I'm doing security leadership, and I appealed to IP,

51
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,340
but there are rules for employees, and it's too physical, so in the end, what customers really

52
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,699
want to protect can be protected with those measures.

53
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,900
Let's see, it's

54
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,360
a lotion.

55
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,200


56
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,220


57
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,650
They say physical seats are fine, so for example, for

58
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,090
something like a gentle mark, let's put important documents in a locker with a key

59
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,850


60
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,479
.  There's a lot of

61
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,639
strength that can be limited to just that. 6

62
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,960
As an aside, I wonder if it's okay to project that child's learning dictionary

63
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,470


64
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,500


65
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,590
.  It

66
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,540


67
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,900


68
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,190


69
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,990


70
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,750
's not just about fishing.  I didn't think

71
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,750


72
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,830
it was possible, so I was thinking about that kind of

73
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,280


74
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,810
thing from the beginning.

75
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:25,000
I wonder if it's interesting

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,470
that you're aiming

77
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:33,890
for the best, thank you so much It would be nice if you followed the lead, did

78
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:40,700


79
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,370


80
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,050
n't you?  Well, the mine is

81
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,000


82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,510
popping, so who do you think this locksmith is?

83
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,880
After listening to the

84
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,849
story, I thought it would be interesting to take a picture of something like

85
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:09,599
that, and Makoto said that two of them died in a big accident at the same time, but it's

86
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,599
possible that there are a lot of them.

87
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:19,770
Katayama, who's trying to start a new business, but if you're just running your own

88
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,719
condominium or

89
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:22,840


90
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,689
something like that, you're tired of having to change keys

91
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:32,080
, and so on.

92
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,350
Thinking that

93
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,700


94
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,480
I have to, do you have all sorts of

95
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,570
things to do

96
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,380
? Is it knitting?  It's not the type that can be scraped off with a

97
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:59,009
normal number, so it's not sold to the extent of asking what kind of feeling it's like after placing an order.

98
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:04,020


99
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,870


100
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,110
Sakina-san's day isn't a remote control,

101
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,350
but it's a guy who's sitting at the entrance,

102
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,100
is

103
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,740


104
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,400
n't it?

105
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:33,539
But Hakone, looking at the gaps, today is the broadcasting method that has worked out everything.

106
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,020


107
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,900


108
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,180


109
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,400


110
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,000


111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,040
It's

112
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,150


113
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:16,090


114
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,360
a song processing robot that doesn't exist.

115
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,890
That's right

116
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:45,300
Boo Boo Today is the house of Noah's family that day Ah Hi Aro It's cool [Music] Boo Boo Keisato Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah, that's what happened to Noah's family that day,

117
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,269


118
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:56,620


119
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,329


120
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:10,339
isn't it?  It's quite easy to talk about

121
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:20,180
it, but if you say that you're a fraudster and a church girl, it's a black child

122
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,910


123
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,840
.

124
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,200
It doesn't freeze from the first lap of the day, isn't it?

125
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,070


126
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,510


127
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,910


128
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:49,270
It's called picking  Tsutsuka Amirone Picking

129
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,059


130
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:57,859


131
00:10:57,859 --> 00:11:02,509
isn't that good, isn't it?  No. 1

132
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:08,270
I'm practicing 'detection,' right? I've learned money management that makes me cry What kind of

133
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,450
theory makes the key cylinder turn?

134
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,970


135
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,459


136
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,420


137
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,900


138
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,250
That's right, you said that you're sleeping

139
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,640
Oh, how much do you hate it?

140
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:45,180


141
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:57,230
It's a 10,000 yen guide, isn't it? It's hot and summer, so I'm going to take a picture

142
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,010


143
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:07,630


144
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,589
.

145
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:14,639


146
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,670
That's right, there are two of them, so go ahead, what did you

147
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:24,150


148
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,810


149
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:42,910


150
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,030
think?  If not, that's where it is at the seaside hotel.

151
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,830
First of all, I'm happy to be with

152
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,769
you, is

153
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:58,350


154
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:05,649


155
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:10,480
n't it?  It may not be a high-end

156
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,820
job, but I said I'd go and do the work.

157
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,680


158
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,529


159
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:23,550
It's a tough scene

160
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,760
4 I really think about this

161
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,690
Horizontal bar number

162
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:38,760
4000 There's a name book

163
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,040


164
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,889
hunt over there  If you think about it, even if one of the teachers provides technology during some key period,

165
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:52,620
it's increasing, isn't it?

166
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,490


167
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:02,340
It's a

168
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,320
little tab voice,

169
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,110
so what's known at that time is the sound of Yakuoku 300,000

170
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,200


171
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,750
good  Oh, oh, I ca

172
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,570
n't do it.

173
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,259


174
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:29,619


175
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:35,769
But

176
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:41,109
what happened when I looked at your key?

177
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:46,250


178
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,090


179
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:56,210
There are about 4 of them

180
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,440
, and each one comes out for each housework pattern, and

181
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,270
it says something like 60,

182
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,400
so if

183
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,790


184
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,800
you learn from M, you'll pick something like this until now.  A

185
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,890
long time ago, or rather, I go to Las Vegas every year at the Rock Picking Village

186
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,990


187
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,040


188
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,700


189
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,920
.  Well, if you taught me so carefully, it would be difficult for

190
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,760
everyone to

191
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,030
open it, but when they found out that it was uneven.

192
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,340


193
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,610


194
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,820
I

195
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,170
can't hang the things I'm selling right now, or rather, it's

196
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,910
difficult because I'm told to smoke it,

197
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,350
so what am I going to do with a new stretcher

198
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:59,630
?  8 Why can't we have a lock-picking village like that in Japan

199
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,670


200
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,100


201
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,870


202
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:19,050
?  It's illegal, so it's illegal to have a

203
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,950


204
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,529
proper reason, so it's the same as this security thing

205
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:29,860
.

206
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,320
How about the fact that you shouldn't have data

207
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,620


208
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,830


209
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,660


210
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:53,260


211
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,280
?  The reason for this is that we have

212
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,980
Chiayi City in China, but it's a pity that even if you have money, you don't have that "

213
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,339
OK" sign.

214
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:12,390
It's one of the reinforcing materials, and

215
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:17,430
we don't think about a convoy.

216
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,169


217
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:26,749
It's

218
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,080
fine, but in the past, when I saw the TV in front of it, the picking was mixed in.

219
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,200


220
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,240
Hey, it looks like it's okay to show it to me, so if you

221
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,260
look at the thinness, you'll find a video on youtube that's really cool

222
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,500
So

223
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,760
you can see how to open it by pulling

224
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,410
it out I've got my cat key tool

225
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,010


226
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:04,669
So, that exchanged change, but the guy who asked me immediately didn't make that kind of sound, but he made a face.

227
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,350


228
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,700


229
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,730


230
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:17,460
It's

231
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,309
tough if the zone is strengthened, isn't

232
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:27,090


233
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,669


234
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:41,499


235
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:44,869
it?  Ah, there's

236
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:45,779


237
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:51,929
quite a bit of a shop, so this sounds amazing

238
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,289


239
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:56,850


240
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,160


241
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:06,080
.

242
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:08,419
What is it that makes you stand in the source of the industry

243
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,720
? Yeah, it

244
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,890
's true.

245
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,320


246
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:29,380
It's going to be one drink automatically. Hey, it's going to be 3 seconds from now

247
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,000


248
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,720


249
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,780


250
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,200
.

251
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,100


252
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,090


253
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:56,889
So

254
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:03,130
, I'm begging you for that, so I'm begging you for that prime

255
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,809
.

256
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:09,929


257
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:11,789


258
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:13,130


259
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:21,200
I've actually used it once in the city of physics, even though it's a key

260
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,410
.

261
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,410


262
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,460
It's a good gear or just looking at the underside It's said that there's no

263
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,370
hole that will make you live It's okay if you have a system for more than 5 minutes

264
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,870


265
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,429
As

266
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:45,940


267
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,029
far

268
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:56,059


269
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:05,979
as I'm concerned, what is picking?  As long as it's off, it's ok Oh,

270
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:10,020


271
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,580


272
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,620
it's about time Patty.

273
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,600
Overworked,

274
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,940
this is Ellen Do you think so

275
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,309


276
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:32,120


277
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,220


278
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,659
?  After a minute, I'm saying it's normal If it

279
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:45,159
's the right

280
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,919
one,

281
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,950


282
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:56,039
I'll check if it's open  Maybe Daiso is already easy, but what I

283
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,220
understand well is

284
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,140
that it's the best to enter and get frustrated, isn't

285
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,510
it

286
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,020
?  I don't

287
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:20,710
know how to open the cylinder key without breaking the pin.

288
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,310


289
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:28,960


290
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,490
It's a checksum turn, and it's

291
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,150
silk, so there were quite a lot of

292
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,360
rubber stamp results, right?

293
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,659


294
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:48,739


295
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:52,009
Shoot with a certain gun A

296
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:54,759
tiger is finished, and it's tied for second place.

297
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:59,100


298
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,140


299
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,420
It's a dish that I want you to bring back with some sort of shield board.

300
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,170


301
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,779


302
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:20,679
How many times  It was absolutely impossible if I didn't go home,

303
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,149
so we learned about cars and

304
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:32,590
so on.

305
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:38,169
Right now, it's the bar version,

306
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:43,899
so I've learned that this kind of thing you see in dramas and thieves is long and thin.

307
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:46,330


308
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,299


309
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,110


310
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:15,690


311
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,129
Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that's good,

312
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:23,719
and that's

313
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:42,029
good.

314
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:49,109


315
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:56,220
I thought, with this, the relationship between usb is good ah ah ah ah ah

316
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,980


317
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,970


318
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,360


319
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:26,550
Here in

320
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,410
the second room of Yashima there's a little

321
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:47,940


322
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,630


323
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,950
ah boo boo hoo why can't

324
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,200
you do

325
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,190
it?  There's

326
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,700
8 cars in Yamabun in that place,

327
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,470
so people watching this av are jumping up Hatter Japan.

328
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:20,970
2 Actually,

329
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:26,549
there is something like that, but if the magazine called Yamanaka Army is now a little more

330
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:30,960
behind the name Hacker Japan

331
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,010
, it has become a proper person for security, which is quite unusual and is in the subculture zone.

332
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,399
Leisure, that Japanese horse

333
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:45,440
.

334
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,070


335
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,789


336
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:55,470
I've been

337
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,870


338
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,230


339
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,800
with the Maintenance Association for ten years or so,

340
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,430
but at the time I didn't have any information, but I

341
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:18,980
'm lucky.  Is this a ginger blog that came out in the 90's or so?

342
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,860


343
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:25,020


344
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,540


345
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:33,450
Hey, I wonder if you're participating or not?

346
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,550


347
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:44,630


348
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:56,410


349
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,490


350
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:34,550


351
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,250


352
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,700
Isn't it Nomi who stops from

353
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:46,170


354
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:50,100


355
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:56,659
yo na?  But if it's a bill that's included ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

356
00:28:56,659 --> 00:29:00,860
ah this cinder wasn't scaled down and it's

357
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,690
a weird kid it's

358
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,480


359
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,429
really motivating  If it's amazing, I think it's become easier to make.

360
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:23,149


361
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:28,279


362
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:30,700


363
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,679
] It's called

364
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,160
Buber,

365
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,430
but if it's

366
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,640
not in that prefecture,

367
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,149
it's hard to know which information

368
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:08,019
is reliable.  It's been a long time since he taught me everything from

369
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,779


370
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:13,710
scratch It's going to fit in your pocket Say that learning is the history of the tree,

371
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:17,419
but that Abe can't be thrown away

372
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:33,450
Boo Boo, it's definitely Nyoro

373
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:38,100
63 Then tweet that usual  After all, I've been studying IE for the rest

374
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,789
of my life, but I

375
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:43,320
thought I'd give it a try, but no one asked me if I was in my stomach,

376
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,460
but at our time, only 10 out of 10 people had a relationship

377
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,580
with Nana Tanaka in December.

378
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,860


379
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,240


380
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:20,270
If

381
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,530


382
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:55,750
it's

383
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:01,730
ctf or something like that, it's not too much  It's a pity that I cut too much to 0.1 as

384
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,810


385
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,740


386
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,850
far as I

387
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,510


388
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:19,540
'm concerned.  It's Thailand's total, but the situation code Mercy

389
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,790
How far the track is cut off

390
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,190
, you'll fall asleep in that audience seat,

391
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:34,500
right?  Well, if that's the case, for example,

392
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:46,179
next year, it's a lover's AV street

393
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:50,619
.

394
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:51,900


395
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,160


396
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,430
Well, the first good idea for moving is a duplicate key

397
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:06,780
making challenge

398
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:12,350
.

399
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:30,520


400
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:36,640
Rosa If something goes wrong, I'll sell that other one and the link set for 500 yen, but

401
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,770
let's

402
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:44,130
do it.

403
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:51,720
I thought it would be interesting to do it in the middle of the day, so I'm going to go to the middle of the day, and I'm going to go to the middle of the day, and I'm going to go to the middle of the day, and I'm going to go to the middle of the day, and I'm going to go to the middle of the day, and I'm going to go to the middle of the day, and I'm going to have a good time

404
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,230


405
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,640


406
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,399
If you're 18, after clearing the limit tour, you're drinking alcohol and

407
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,339
cutting out the mold inside.

408
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:16,909


409
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,349


410
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:21,799
After all, they say they'll do it little by little,

411
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:23,820
so

412
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,620
when I hear Kajiya's sadness, I have to hand over the difficult

413
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,090
things to take, but I can't adjust.

414
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:30,960


415
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,560


416
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,000
That's why it's been a month since I've been in a difficult place in the modern world.In the

417
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,149
end, I'm most worried about calling the Laker number and having them place an order.

418
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:47,460


419
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,820


420
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:54,020


421
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,550


422
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,150
There's an area just like that combination of locks I think there's an

423
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,030
area in the east where I raise mine

424
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,390
I think that day I still have to wait a little bit

425
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:10,060


426
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:15,040
72 cases within a 100

427
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,260


428
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,480
-meter radius.

429
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,900
Or rather

430
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,410
, since it's a

431
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,359
pharmacy, I really tried to explain it for business purposes, right?

432
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,850


433
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,580
I don't know, but I don't know

434
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:55,190
Buber's whiteness by Omoide

435
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,000
If you want to see ours, but I'm thinking of buying it, I'll get it and

436
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,840
boil it,

437
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,770
just the word "arm hair" is invincible.

438
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:16,600
But that's not the case, Mr. Kagibayashi from the song in the car in the car is a synthetic 2 today

439
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,010


440
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,510


441
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,720
, isn't

442
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,150
it?  After saying that you're going to do research on how you made the smart key, please tell me various things

443
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,170


444
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,490
.

445
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:41,170
Well, it's possible in

446
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:47,980
terms of time, but it's difficult outside of starting the engine.

447
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,999


448
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:56,269


449
00:36:56,269 --> 00:37:01,459
The process is about to enter from the key

450
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:04,569
, what is it,

451
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:07,710


452
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,990
how long will it take you

453
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:17,329
to sleep?

454
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:21,880
Well, that physics and the morning video are a fusion, and

455
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,130


456
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,789
fortunately there are

457
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:34,640
a lot of places like 100 cars in both Japan and overseas, but it doesn't come out, but that's what I'm aiming for, so it's photogenic.  I do

458
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,319
n't have anything

459
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:38,760


460
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,060


461
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:45,410


462
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,690
to suggest to you, but it's pretty limited, and it's an obvious movie, so I did a little research on how to do it.  If you think it's stupid,

463
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:56,380
you can't do it, right? It's equipment, it's not the

464
00:37:57,339 --> 00:38:01,500
same medicated water, it's a flight.

465
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,720


466
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,470


467
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,850


468
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:13,560


469
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,780
In the future, I'll try

470
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:24,040
it with millions of tens of millions of dollars, even if it's a little expensive.

471
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,970


472
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,300
Two years ago, in that sweet

473
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:39,990
VX book, at our school's workshop,

474
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:45,900
there was a person who was good at nott, and that person who was good at nott entered.

475
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,060


476
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,990
pick up

477
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:58,070
soft  It's directly managed by Mr.

478
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:02,750


479
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:07,210
Oishi.

480
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:15,970
If there aren't two people involved in the management of the car, it's no good if people who approach it can get caught in that car.

481
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,619


482
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:23,619


483
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:27,349
If you come out

484
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:31,130


485
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:38,260
, you'll be on a new

486
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:45,100
shore.

487
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,390
Absolute research material

488
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,650
We are aiming for a fusion of leather in good condition

489
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,660


490
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,580
.

491
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:15,150


492
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:21,960
It's normal to have a console like this, and usually that default h path is included, isn't

493
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,230


494
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:27,510


495
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:34,010
it?  Come on the iPhone version,

496
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,970
it

497
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:39,000
's there,

498
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,080


499
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:48,170
isn't it?

500
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,640


501
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,599
Okita-kun, you're really good

502
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:59,690
at being able to enter something

503
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:04,520


504
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,160
like a financial institution in one year, aren't you?  Shooting and the venue,

505
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,849
that guy is strong because he can give an impact in an easy-to-understand way.

506
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:21,109


507
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,150


508
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,730


509
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,640
No,

510
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,010
the guy in that room is managed collectively regardless

511
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:57,650


512
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,170


513
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:05,060
of zoning permission.

514
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:11,560
It's not blue, so I'll take it, so I'll do it like this

515
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:25,590
Depending on how you put the boo-boo, it's not a female announcer on this screen, it's already a

516
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,839


517
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,109
worker  In the first place, that's what it is, isn't it? I think that if you put in a place in a park or something like that, you'll

518
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:36,859
be able to hit it.

519
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:42,589


520
00:42:42,589 --> 00:42:48,109
Sato

521
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:51,130
[ __ ] I thought I'd like to take on more challenges

522
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,010


523
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:59,620
, so there

524
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,900


525
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:14,880
was a time when I didn't agree with the person I was supposed to be.  Chatte Patty

526
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,710
That's what I've done once, isn't it

527
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,720


528
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,410


529
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:30,060


530
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:34,590
?  I was wondering if I could call out to them, but I wondered if I could call them

531
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,910


532
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:41,829


533
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:48,279
like this.  But in a normal room page ad,

534
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:53,079
even if there's one person who doesn't know who they are, it's something that makes people

535
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:56,259
think that they

536
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,030


537
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:02,260
're just peeing from the house or field.  Well, I

538
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,470
'm already a kid who's doing it at any company that has withdrawn,

539
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,880
but I'm doing intermission consulting

540
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,099
again, well, the penetration test I've got is coming, so I'm going to go to a place where it's about time to move to a different place.

541
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:18,920


542
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:26,460
55. On the other hand, I sat down with you and gave you estimates from various companies, and

543
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,150
from the day I returned to Tokyo, Yamaha

544
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,420


545
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,870


546
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:37,290
was a big deal.

547
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:42,320
I have to say that this company does a lot of physics

548
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,270


549
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:51,010


550
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,900
.

551
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:01,100
You can download it with your thumbs up It

552
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,470
seems like it's there Well, it's a

553
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,480


554
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,100
little bit too much, isn't it

555
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,260
?

556
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,060


557
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,050
If you're

558
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:28,170
someone who likes Filipino things, I think it's the gateway to vulnerability diagnosis

559
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,460


560
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,250
.

561
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:36,480


562
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,800


563
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,130
That's why it's a bit different from the heart muscle-like thing, isn't it?

564
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:48,300


565
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,110


566
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,710
Children are also

567
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:59,680
real, so it's a

568
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:06,490
little different, isn't it

569
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:08,150


570
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,130


571
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:15,430
?  My face may be that way, but I'm not one of the 7 types I'm

572
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:20,920
just greedy There was a mist in the next day It's okay not to be moe It's

573
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,470
quite a concept role with a

574
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:30,470
lot of nasty sour Compared to others or compared to before  Assuming that there is a time difference,

575
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:34,970
yes, it's a hard time, so anyway, I was born on the day of the week.

576
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,690


577
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,800


578
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,559


579
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:48,710
What I'm saying is

580
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,220
that you can choose whichever you need for 10% of your work

581
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,820


582
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:08,730


583
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:14,050
.

584
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:17,460
Hey, again, ladies' down jacket

585
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,810
I hope you've seen the good fight in access

586
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:29,220


587
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,510
.  I'm already

588
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:33,720
stuck,

589
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,220
maybe

590
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:47,000
pou dou dou Shizudai Patty I'm still ordering from Penetration - Which one is Ouchi

591
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,420


592
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:55,240


593
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,890
Latiwood?

594
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:05,250


595
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:10,830


596
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,790


597
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:17,600
No, even when I received that request,

598
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:22,960
it was still

599
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:30,010
quite a conspiracy.  Transcendence is a penetration test at a company, etc.

600
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:35,480
There are 4 people with 5 employees in a month

601
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,180


602
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,870


603
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,480
.

604
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:51,020
After that, I had no choice but to do things like beautify the store, but I'm a cat, so I'm conscious of

605
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:55,759
it.

606
00:48:55,759 --> 00:49:01,579
Nail art is all low-floor, but it's difficult, but I happened to buy Marutani on that web

607
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:03,150


608
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,440
.

609
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,940


610
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:41,000


611
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,510


612
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:46,800
Even if people become members of this area, if they find out, will

613
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,890
there be a house called Lilith at the site

614
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:54,030


615
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:56,190


616
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,330


617
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,600
?  It seems

618
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,220
like I'm an ad group log.

619
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:09,000


620
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,180


621
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,170


622
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:21,280
It's the scene where Neji A

623
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,320
appears.

624
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:34,160


625
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,230


626
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:39,130


627
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:55,220


628
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:55,710


629
00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:00,069
I'm

630
00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:06,380
doing it alone No, there are quite a lot of separate mediations together,

631
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,460
so I'm thinking about buying it after using it, isn't

632
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,300


633
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:18,000
it?  I'm using it as a cat, but I'm in a

634
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,840
different position, and three minutes ago, that big brother was there,

635
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:29,640
and I'm also in his room.

636
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,890
However, there were 108 people in the edition year

637
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:38,789


638
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:42,479


639
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:44,779


640
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:03,500


641
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:03,840


642
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,160
.  Then there's the wi-fi story on the

643
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,060
scrapped

644
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:28,700
car, booby and booby, oh

645
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,050
no, wi-fi to the Toyukai Dia, right

646
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,850


647
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:39,680
?

648
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:47,630
But it's a different matter if everyone gathers and hides the darkness, but on the 3rd

649
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,290


650
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,400


651
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,830


652
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:15,109
.

653
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,140


654
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:22,560
Then

655
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,500
the power supply of the consumption layer bc is an Aval dish, so

656
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,700
please wait.

657
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,700


658
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:36,180


659
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:54,299
That's the year Boo Boo This one

660
00:53:54,299 --> 00:54:01,189
00 e 4 e 4 e 4 her you do I have

661
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,830
irq The year is raised I don't know

662
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:13,509
which road is reflected and I heard only love's voice

663
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:20,109
This 5  Occasionally, time

664
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:28,879


665
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,270
flies, so how do

666
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:41,009
you survive?

667
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:50,600


668
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,940
