00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,330
That's how I closed my home, but

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,250
after that, it's Lyman.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,680

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,820

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,490
It's a delivery service

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:38,160
They're all

00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,899

10
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,669

16
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,339


17
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,090


18
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,210


19
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,610
Well, I still have it because it's been discontinued, so you remember the plan, right? I

20
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,380
haven't finished my wavy hair

21
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,890


22
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,920


23

.  Children's intractable diseases continue First of all, it

25
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,530


26
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:54,130
's been 8 years.It won't happen at all.

27
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,150


28
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:01,080


29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,000


30
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,220
The loudness of everyone's voices

31
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,880
is drunk.

32
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,590


33
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,190


34
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,579


35
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,480
In the next story, I'm going to extend the closing a bit, but it's

36
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,830
worth playing that ctf awardee today

37
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:41,250


38
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,140


39
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,850
.  Then it should be 8 hours, but isn't it

40
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,050
already 8?

41
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,510


42
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,620


43
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,420


44

45
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:38,630


46
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,470
But four

47

51
00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:01,160
people have a lot of fans.On the 4th, Wenna was attacked by Hacker Japan 21. Oh, I also got a criminal record.

52
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,670


53
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:10,350
Haha I've progressed If you're going to buy more and more from the edge, I'm sorry, but if you buy this and that, you won't be able to make

54
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,810
money.

55
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,700


56

of Honor

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,720
Iwanaka said, "I

61
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,700
'm going to study in a form that wasn't told to me

62
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:50,310
during the time period

63
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,129
."  That's right

64
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,909
, no one read

65
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,240
Boo

66
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:32,830
Boo Boo Boo

67
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,460
There are always 3 venues, but whatever the door

68
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,980


69
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,480
N Zone, I talked about it a while ago, but I used to do ad 2000 xk

70
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,310
Giant's time at night Yes, Atago, well, that's how it was

71
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,249
Go ahead, morning cafe,

72
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:53,339
ahhh, Ginza or something like that,

73
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:55,840
but that's true, but it's better

74
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,260
than the natural light,

75
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,999
so please

76
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:05,879
do it at a live house 4 Hey, we were all sitting on the floor at the live house.

77
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,030


78
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,950
The local government has been complaining that it's been carried out by the local government, so it's

79
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,199


80
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,950


81
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,090
just that everyone has been watching this dictionary

82
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,800


83
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800


84
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,260
recently.  People

85
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,910
are interested in Bloody Monday 2.

86
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,460
Look at that, the spring has stopped coming. Everyone is shocked.

87
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,020


88
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,950
It's not out yet, so look where it came out

89
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,250
Umm, you know, it's already posted in the emote thread

90
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,720


91
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,490
, but it's really bad, but it's really appearing as an extra

92
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:20,500


93
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,669


94
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,130
If you

95
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,050
tell Ueno-san who you're looking for, you might be able to get something.

96
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,750


97
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,890


98
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,970


99
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,160
The Willer road is said

100
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,050


101
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,480


102
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,860


103

already You've accumulated points and you'll understand It's a female pro Probably 6 Jingu

104
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,440


105
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,579


106
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,200


107
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,320


108
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,590
Luckily,

109
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,519
that's why it's online I wonder how it was in av Tokyo How

110
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:48,769


111
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,519


112
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,770


113
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:02,560
was it?  Tara two hattarappan old ad dx

114

115
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,900
wow wow 20 though

116
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,580
After all, that one time would be fine if we did it in ev a long time ago

117
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,900
No one said anything about the sound of space

118
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,180
Yes, the

119
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:23,840
security incident border is too much.

120
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,870


121
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,440
I don't know what to say about the rest, but it's not like that, but it's not like that lol So it's

122
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,270
about time for various events to end,

123
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,010
isn't it?

124
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,490


125
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,640


126
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,190
I'm afraid I should have canceled the flight I want to share the screen a little

127
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,270


128
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,020


129
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,450


130
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,900


131
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,139
Now, Asia Paralever, give me that locker

132
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:18,010


133
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,300


134
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,890


135
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:32,570
.  It's a

136
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,640
fan, so it's going to take a little time.

137
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,080


138
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,860


139
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,670


140
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:52,280
That's why I'm only looking for information that's mostly open to the public in open source intelligence.

141
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,000


142
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,850


143
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:14,970


144
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:33,300
Well,

145
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,960
iki and research

146
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,629
I skipped it if I made it tomorrow, but I'm of the opinion that it's a suit.

147
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,079


148
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,739


149
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:50,100
I'm thinking about it

150
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,950
Well, it's quite difficult to find that opponent and make a team It's hard to find a team with love for two, but if you

151
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,050


152
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,709
make a pet dog, there's less security

153
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,890
What is this?

154
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:25,710


155
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,400
I'm going to give a little more detail

156
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,860
later, so if you look at the problem after this

157
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,080
, I think you'll be able to understand what it was

158
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,710


159
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,890
like.  I have a lot

160
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,920
i  n The simplest question, who is

161
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,660


162
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,500


163
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,920
?  It's a problem, isn't it? This is a North Korean group, and it's a problem of

164
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,850
10 batters together looking at the place where the photo was taken.

165
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:11,579


166
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:12,990


167
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,850
I was doing things Well, that's what I'm talking about After all,

168
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,410
there are quite a few problems that can only be solved by one person, from simple problems to difficult problems that can't be solved

169
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,550


170
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,610
.

171
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,379
Inheritance and dullness

172
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:30,490
Yes, it's

173
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,760
English.

174
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,490


175
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,700
Yay. Votes

176
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,649

265
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,079
situation?  I thought,

266
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,059
I was doing it without any motivation at all, but if I say something like I don't want to do it,

267
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,580


268

I couldn't do it

276
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:02,820
properly with various sponsors.  To tell the truth, I am truly grateful to the person who gave me this, so I

277
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,330


278
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,120
have something that I would like to think about next time

279
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,280
in a way that I can return the favor.  However,

280
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,700
it

281
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:20,220
's an archive of this video as a matter of communication, but it's been two weeks since it's been tattered on the Twitch side, so

282
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,970


283
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,160
if I can watch that much,

284
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,080
what should I do with the phantom beast?

285
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,600
I haven't, but it feels like that, so if you missed it, please check it out as soon as possible.
