1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,510


2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,459
That's the major

3
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:19,440


4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,750
you want.

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,290
I've been doing Halloween pops, but it's

6
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,990
already getting colder, so

7
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,220
I'd like to introduce you to hoodies.

8
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,220


9
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,150
Well, it's a hoodie It's a

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,200
little black for winter I'm awake today too

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,960


12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800


13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,879


14
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,830


15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,540
I'd like to introduce

16
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,720
the

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720


18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,670
hoodie as well.  It's different, but this

19
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,320


20
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:36,950
is something that's sold online.

21
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,750


22
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,860


23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,280


24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,640


25
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,700


26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,450


27
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,070
So, after this, I'll leave Jeju Island to pass the winter early.

28
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,150


29
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,409


30
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,408


31
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,710


32
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,100


33
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,850


34
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,250
It doesn't seem to change for a while, so

35
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,950
it

36
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,270
's a

37
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,030
plan, but do you think

38
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,100
it

39
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,910
's enough?

40
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,430
