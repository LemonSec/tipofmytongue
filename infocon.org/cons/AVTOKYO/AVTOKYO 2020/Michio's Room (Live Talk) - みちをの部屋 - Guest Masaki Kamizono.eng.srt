[laughter]

3
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,130
Boo boo men and women,

4
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:30,029
they

5
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,800


6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,300


7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,000


8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,510
'll give it to me.

9
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,730
So I can talk like this

10
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,850
I feel like I'm talking with the camera on

11
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,450
Tanihara's one and a half hours or something

12
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:06,449


13
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,590
.

14
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,560
It's a 3's spanmare profile It's a

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,140
pre-yes What is it?

16
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,850


17
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,540


18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,430


19
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,400
Wait a

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,980
minute What is that no-guard plan really?

21
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,870


22
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,030


23
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,410


24
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:55,500
Yes, it's Saturday.

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,080


26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,740


27
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,890


28
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,069


29
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:17,620


30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,620


31
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,710
Mr. Wasaki,

32
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,960
thank you very much for your cooperation.

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,730


34
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,049


35
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:36,200


36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,050


37
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,610


38
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,320
Well,

39
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,760
I think it's about the first time I

40
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,510


41
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,290


42
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,569
've talked about what he's wearing over there.  Well, well

43
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,440
, it's a form that seems to continue on a regular basis.

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,980


45
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,740


46
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:29,680


47
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,120


48
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,379
That's why, what is that room?

49
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,390


50
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,130


51
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,900


52
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,519
Or should I say, let's talk while tracing the history of that job so far

53
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,010


54
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,530
.  Yes, on

55
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,880
the 10th of my university days,

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,510
I was assigned to Professor Molly's laboratory at Kobe University

57
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,930


58
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,080
.

59
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,329


60
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,540
Yes, after that, it suddenly became that point, that

61
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,630
Han Chinese, who was told that tomorrow there will be a margae, and he went through the hole, and the

62
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,800
front line 10 f 0 is big

63
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,900
Yes, the foreign minister is really messy.

64
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:41,600
Really Cure Cure All of them

65
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,700
use normal vinegar and use tools from Microsoft, so I don't

66
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,370
really understand.

67
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,370


68
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:07,260
But it's been about four years, but I've been working in a completely

69
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,360


70
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,940
different field

71
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,409


72
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:20,119
for about four years

73
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,639


74
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,849
.  There's a lot of fear here,

75
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:30,789
hello, but that's the door, is

76
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,169
n't it?

77
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:37,479


78
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:44,840
The earthing system of the

79
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120


80
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,820
4th floor was like Banff and Angels Fonts, so it

81
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,150
was a little strange behind the scenes of the video.

82
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,500


83
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,310
After that, I went to the security service Rencher,

84
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:07,280
and there is a form of product development and research and development.

85
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,289


86
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:12,260


87
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,000


88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,930
After that, I don't know if it was reflected in the Consulting 4

89
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,150
Farm.A lot of research presentations have been done since the time of the venture,

90
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:34,229
right?

91
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:35,160


92
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,520
or shake the exe file  Outside pe,

93
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,700
ah, ah, lift, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I like hearts

94
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,500


95
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,480


96
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,840


97
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,349
Yes

98
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,450
,

99
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,650
after that, there was a salut and a consultant.

100
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:16,030


101
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,980
It's not

102
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,160


103
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,449
good to make a psoas muscle machine and use that technology to create

104
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:29,569
research and development projects,

105
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:33,229
or to sublimate rushed cards in the middle of the night.

106
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,379


107
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:36,750


108
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,950
Rion It's hard to put it on the table, so

109
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,390
yes, yes, I made

110
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:47,400


111
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,230


112
00:07:49,230 --> 00:08:02,380
it.  On that day,

113
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,220
I made about 8 solutions.

114
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,430


115
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:17,860


116
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:24,420
I feel like it's a field that needs a lot of things, but yes,

117
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,830
it's still about services, I think it's a person who has a sense of whether or not it's suitable for that kind of business,

118
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:37,010
and the ability to come up with various ideas based on that.

119
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,200
That's an interesting area, isn't

120
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,320
it? Well, while doing business

121
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,990
, there are of course the needs of customers, and what is it?

122
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,320


123
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,160


124
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,420
I think that when you do things a little bit more, you can do things like this and everything will be solved, and you'll be able to push that new

125
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,810
thing, but

126
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,020
if you do, you'll understand it properly, so

127
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,310
that's about it.  Somehow,

128
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,930
I feel like I want to do things with a high level of sensitivity.

129
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,529


130
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,649


131
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:26,499
It's a little

132
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,520
bit

133
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,200
more  It

134
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,640
feels like Japan is already ahead of Japan, isn't it?

135
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,350


136
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,520


137
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,170


138
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,220


139
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,970


140
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,910
I'm good at that area, but I'm good at

141
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,980
it.

142
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,830


143
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,790
On the contrary, I think it's selfish,

144
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,880


145
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,970
well, it's a program that goes to great lengths

146
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,550
to create something new.

147
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:28,080


148
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,010


149
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:34,259
I'm doing it, but it would have been nice if I could have been able to easily give feedback to

150
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,480


151
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,709


152
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:44,670


153
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,100


154
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,830
that sort of thing.  Let's go in the middle of the night,

155
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,940
Nakata says that it's because of what we're

156
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,740


157
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,330
providing as a service.Ah, what about electromagnetic waves?  If you repeat that,

158
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,450
you can eventually update the machine world, so

159
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,750
well, it's coming out in a good way.

160
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,720
What was that?

161
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,339


162
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,120


163
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,189
This was the city's research institute, and that's in the department called c-seg, but

164
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:30,529
hi, css, it's different from the land, but it's a coincidence, isn't

165
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,830


166
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,920
it?  Seth Kotoru Heart Accident Test Type Genetic-Based Clinical Practice

167
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,030
I was afraid of the charity that flew yesterday, but I'm going to lose Oh, the seasoning is delicious.

168
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,300


169
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,230


170
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,740
Aretha's papers are pretty

171
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,130
good, or

172
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,070


173
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,950


174
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,680
rather, it's written with a lot of power.

175
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,320
I don't think it's written down, but I think it would be better if you were really born and created a solution and wrote a thesis,

176
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,040
and then properly

177
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,939
disseminated the results.

178
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:27,889


179
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:32,680
But there are

180
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,170


181
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,870


182
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,000


183
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,360
quite a few papers written.  For those

184
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,980
who

185
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,459
say, in a

186
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:15,100
sense, it's like writing papers or doing research and development

187
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,470
.

188
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:26,260
It depends on the organization, but we have properly declared that we are going to go with this kind of policy this season

189
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,990
and have received approval, so

190
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,250
rather than complaining about something, if the results come out properly, they wo

191
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,250
n't say anything in particular.  It's

192
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,630
kind of like that, but it's difficult to get the results.

193
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,700


194
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:48,780


195
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,020


196
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,840
Done services are chops to donate, but there may be this, ah, that's right

197
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,760
, but it's not like

198
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,950
that Boo Boo plan How did you

199
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,769


200
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,309
declare that you're going to make a big output in this form?  I think that's right,

201
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,339
it's sunny, maybe

202
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,459
Mr. Jinno approves, but what is it?

203
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,080


204
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,810


205
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,380


206
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,410


207
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,430
I'm thinking about it in the form of "Well, well, it's not this time," so it's true. It's a

208
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,800


209
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,519
company.

210
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,769


211
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:52,010
It's called a research institute, and it's got

212
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,900


213
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,260
that kind of culture.

214
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,200


215
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,670


216
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,850


217
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,860
Somehow, it seems that the brown color is expensive.  It's a

218
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,890
good culture,

219
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,360
but I thought it was about ramen.

220
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,829


221
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:29,310


222
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:35,790
That's the part

223
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,940
that really sticks out, isn't

224
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,540
it so noticeable?

225
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,240
[Laughter]

226
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,000
2 e

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,980


228
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,210
.

229
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,720
After all, looking at high magnetism, the

230
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,710
academic world and its live-action adaptation may be different,

231
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:07,230
but if you look closely, you'll find that the problems that need to be solved are

232
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,070
the same.

233
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,360
I think that the various forms of harmony are the key to raising your

234
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,730


235
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,340


236
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,670


237
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,540


238
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,279
senses.

239
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,810


240
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,620


241
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,160


242
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,420
There are some people among them who I have to show them the end of the theme and the specific beauty, and

243
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:49,740
so on.

244
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,180


245
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,710


246
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,310


247
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,089


248
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:04,929
I wonder what I should do to get

249
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:09,549
them to find a theme.  Is there something you don't understand?

250
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:10,670


251
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,619


252
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:19,930


253
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,589


254
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,059


255
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,929
I'm sure you've made it this far by accumulating small

256
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,310


257
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,430


258
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,790
things like this.

259
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,990
If you build up the group one by one, you'll be able to do this, so

260
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,780
yeah,

261
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,060
I wonder if Mr. I is like this, but I see.

262
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,410


263
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,790


264
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,910


265
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:02,020
I get the feeling that it might be that

266
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:10,390
way.  Mr. Sakai from the phrase often says that if you set that big goal, you will often get

267
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,810
frustrated, but

268
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,590


269
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,669
if you come up with an idea without playing, 7 things you can do are first

270
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:18,759


271
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,080


272
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,410
.

273
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,190
But I think it's really good, and

274
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,660
yes, it's just my taste, isn't it? It's your hand-me-down.

275
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,660


276
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,820


277
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,560
It's like entering the Mass from that side and putting out the originality from there.

278
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,100


279
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,119


280
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:53,419


281
00:18:53,419 --> 00:19:01,520
Don't move on to the first one is fast

282
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,990
Ah, I'm sorry, so I'm just sorry, how far have you progressed

283
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:11,780


284
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,850


285
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,309
?  Hey,

286
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:20,000
that's certainly true,

287
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,140
but considering the overall flow of creating something instead of

288
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,370
letting it live today, it's not really moving forward,

289
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,990


290
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,130
is it?

291
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,440
I wonder if there are things that I don't understand.It's

292
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,310
nice to have videos.It's rare

293
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,650


294
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:52,790


295
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,940
.

296
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:00,240
That's right, it's going to disappear somehow, but if you

297
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,159
look at the cycle of emergencies, you'll understand if you try to create a service to some extent, differentiate it, and announce it

298
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:06,690
.

299
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:14,190
I wonder if it's okay to give it a try.In the lab I belonged to, we do disease research before research

300
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,330
.

301
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,449


302
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:36,400


303
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,620
In the midst of that, I knew that I should do this, and that

304
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,550
I was going to Yahoo for shipping, so I was pretty sure that

305
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,890


306
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,300
it would help me to understand.

307
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,660


308
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,850
For example, it's more about the shadow of that

309
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,250
, so I'm worried about whether or not my thesis will be

310
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,690
accepted.

311
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,110


312
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,500


313
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,430


314
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,800
If you don't practice every minute, it

315
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,250
feels like you're holding three or four matches at the same time, isn't

316
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,130


317
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,920


318
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,680
it?  That's right

319
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,040
, I think that's right. It's the same with how to read that paper, isn't it?

320
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:40,600


321
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,700


322
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,630
I think there are some people who don't try to turn things around a bit

323
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,070


324
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,110
, I'm sure.

325
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:00,920
What's written is

326
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,630
only pure work, in

327
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,050
order,

328
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:21,400
boo boo Well, if you don't read it, you won't understand that kind of feeling

329
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,610


330
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:27,840


331
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,420
.

332
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,010


333
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,630
Also, from the perspective

334
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,990


335
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,940
of Sonus, there are times when I don't understand the comments of the peer reviewer, Shin-san, who deserts me, but when

336
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,380
I say

337
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,440
this, it's a bit of a world of words.  But hey,

338
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,470
I can't read this all day long, June 2, 2016 Manny

339
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,280
That's right

340
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,590
Boo

341
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:20,650
Boo No, there's a lot of research being done I'll tell you where it is

342
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,600


343
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:34,050
After all, it's like the feeling that you can get by doing a certain number of things,

344
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,150


345
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,410


346
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,330
isn't it necessary

347
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,630


348
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,790
?  I don't think so, but after all, I think that whether or not it resonates with the people who work on it is a matter of wounds by wounds, isn't

349
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,410


350
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,030
it?

351
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:03,070


352
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,190
Ao:

353
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,070
I can't

354
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,179


355
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:16,450
even try to take countermeasures by looking at people, can't I?

356
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,169
I think it's done well,

357
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,680
but

358
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:30,690
on the contrary, if you say that and get caught in a situation where the desert is too low, you'll have

359
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,720
to look at people and take countermeasures.  When you let it blow fire

360
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,340
[music]

361
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:41,660
That's what roofers can do It's cancer, isn't it?

362
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,340


363
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,789


364
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:52,880
In order to hedge the risk

365
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,620
, I do multiple things

366
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,070


367
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,340
.  Well, yes,

368
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:15,150
yes, God, I've been thinking that I'd like

369
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,970


370
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:26,610
to listen to it for a while.  It's coming, but it's a

371
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,330
system, isn't it? As a

372
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,740


373
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,990
research adviser

374
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,760
, I think that real things are being viewed as problems in various places.

375
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,850
So there are things like going home later, and my

376
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:46,770
mother's

377
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,490
scenery, for example

378
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:55,730
, I'm using AI now to make transactions in the form of this or that brand

379
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,890
.

380
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,600


381
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,900


382
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,230


383
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,410
I really have to think a little about whether we should do this in the next year as well, or in a sense, whether we should take countermeasures against things like AI clone attacks.

384
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,309


385
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:22,019
There is some debate as to whether or not it's okay to call ai something ai-like, but

386
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:28,200
when a variety of technologies like that come out as implementations, they're

387
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,650


388
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,420
fragile in various aspects.  It's been researched, and in

389
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,390
fact, there are 10 typical examples of various attacks, and we're in the business phase now,

390
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,580


391
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,860
so we really have to think about a lot of things.

392
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,210
Or

393
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:54,760
rather, things like debugging methods have not yet been systematized.

394
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,450


395
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,110


396
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,730


397
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,620
It's easy to see how effective implementation and research are

398
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,580


399
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,750


400
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:24,480
.  I think that there are cases where there is neither strength nor

401
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,549


402
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:31,249
luck.In the future, there will probably be words such as evaluating, auditing, and assessing

403
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,299


404
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:38,489
that kind of thing

405
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:42,570
.  That's right, I think that it's not just the system, but

406
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,220
behind the system, there will be a hero assessment that will serve as a decision point for the booths

407
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,320
that will be running

408
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,290


409
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:57,610
after that.

410
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,370
Around 2011, I

411
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,370
worked with a mathematician

412
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,280
to create two remodels

413
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,570
and sell that kind of technology.

414
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:13,180


415
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:20,550
I tried to do a lot of research, but

416
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:27,500
that's the way we do it when we're creating a logical and mathematical model, so

417
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,130
we don't look like a black box,

418
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:37,760
but now, for example, deep learning is the same.  I don't really understand what's inside, but the

419
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,140
amount of money

420
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:47,260
I spent on it was based on that understanding, and I used it to produce results, and I was able to implement

421
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,360


422
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,340
it.

423
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,990
I feel like I don't know if I should write the engine that uses the current sound

424
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,380
, right?

425
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,240


426
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,990


427
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,200
Well, well, well, that's a common thing with that AI, and it's snow,

428
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,330
um, it learned something like a sample that went to Advancedr

429
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,230


430
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:29,080
.  Ah, it's a common pattern, but that's not all

431
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,640
there is to it, so there must be a world that's

432
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,010


433
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,540


434
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:38,510
more urgent than that, but I think it's a part of it, but I think we have to source it.

435
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,600


436
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,080


437
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,620


438
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,250
Creating a data set that doesn't happen is something new The data set itself is something

439
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:52,530


440
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:57,390
that's attracting attention as a theme.

441
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:02,460
will come out as

442
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,630


443
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:10,320
research  The data collected from actual sensors

444
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,610
is,

445
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,269
well, the world of the academy,

446
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:22,719
or rather, the very first thing I was told when I started doing research was that it had to be actual data.

447
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:25,980


448
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,420
But at that time, I thought that I wanted to do this attack detection, and when I said that it would

449
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:37,940
be best to use the data that actually observed the attack before the attack, I had

450
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,679
to do that to her.

451
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,710
It's actually observed data, and it's the top 5 most popular attack

452
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,540


453
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:53,970
vectors, isn't it?

454
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,840


455
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,320
If you were to use it as a dataset, what would happen to the handling of the 95 part of that pride?

456
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,230


457
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,430


458
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,890


459
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:20,920
Including the remaining 95, there are 100 evacuees, including the remaining 95. If about 98 are included in that number, then that's

460
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:28,390
fine. That's what you should aim for.

461
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:35,430
Hey, you're coughing a little,

462
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:39,000


463
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,850
aren't you?

464
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,640


465
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,230
I don't think so, but in the end, a lot of it is done by humans.

466
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:54,320


467
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,409


468
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:02,179


469
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:08,570
Isn't there a model that I want to learn in this study

470
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:13,309
, and when I say that it's difficult to create a model that I only know about this kind of case, it works

471
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:14,310
well in a sense, in

472
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,460
a way, like a big scene.

473
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,140
Some people

474
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:27,030
think that they're doing things like swimming pools, but that's the end of the story.

475
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,170


476
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:37,980
I can't help but feel like I have to put some kind of algorithm or judgment

477
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,320
logic in

478
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,400
there.

479
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:50,480


480
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,380


481
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,410
Even if you follow only the elements of each cat in

482
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:59,280
a series of processes after the back, it's

483
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,880
probably a

484
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,520
fun balance, but

485
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,370
it's true.

486
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,200
And

487
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,510
this jacket ai is starting to be used in various ways,

488
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,960
and there are quite a few guys who use black socks for their socks

489
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,230


490
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,180


491
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,710
.

492
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:33,910
I'm trying to do my best, so it's a good measure.

493
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,870


494
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,020


495
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,530


496
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,640


497
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,110


498
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,200
It's okay if it's lined up to some extent,

499
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,340
but I've been chasing things like that,

500
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:58,549
Mr. Ozawa, to see if it goes well.

501
00:33:58,549 --> 00:33:59,270


502
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,620


503
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,640
I'm saying that it's true, but I'm saying that it's actually true.

504
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,230


505
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:16,280


506
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,270


507
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,960
I'm

508
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,360
doing

509
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,800
something like loosely kissing, saying that it's an attack, including harassment, or something

510
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,350


511
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,139
like that.

512
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,418
Well, no,

513
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:51,589
ah, the money is Boubapattis, just

514
00:34:53,989 --> 00:35:00,140
before Buber,

515
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,720
I think it's really interesting.

516
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,670


517
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:12,349


518
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:17,780
The number of roads has increased and

519
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,690


520
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:26,930


521
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,190
it has become more convenient.  Then, there is also the fact

522
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:36,890
that a dummy company that pays money has set up a web site that is not suspicious, and

523
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:40,710


524
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,280
Hi-Corp has become amazing on tape.  It may be used in the form of a service or

525
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,170
something like that, perhaps even in the

526
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:53,690
election campaign.  I think it's amazing

527
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:59,119
that one of the reasons why so much fake news is coming out these days is that the jpeg thirds service is becoming

528
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,369
more popular

529
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:04,990


530
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,320


531
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,270
.

532
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:14,990


533
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,730
I wanted to detect something, but in the

534
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:25,119
end, it ended up being something like a human

535
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,270
checking it.

536
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,330


537
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:35,830
But what I mean by this is, for example

538
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:42,310
, when people who make remarks like influencers apply hundreds of thousands of yen

539
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,000


540
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,020
, so let's follow likes and followers in overseas tourist spots,

541
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,130
um, a little money.  It's like if you pay for it, you'll be able to put it on

542
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:57,140
iim, but someone with a lot of money suddenly starts saying something like this, and I want to listen intently.

543
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,400


544
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,540


545
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,160
Well, I wonder if they're going

546
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,190
to look at it in the form of

547
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,020
something like

548
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,170
they're being beaten.

549
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,339


550
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:25,410
When I look at it, it's like, 'I'm looking up', and

551
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:32,279
there's a sharp 'Pyun' here, and it's really,

552
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:35,890
really, really, really, really, really strong, and then it

553
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,860
suddenly disappeared.

554
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,090


555
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,620


556
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,940
It's a

557
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:53,000
temporary thesis, but after all, please join it on a regular

558
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,079


559
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,710
basis.

560
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,330
I

561
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,960
guess I forgot about the armor at the 7th stage in the middle of some stages, but

562
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,470
let's go cut it

563
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,000
.

564
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,720
Now, I've got the idea that

565
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,359
I can do some research on this, such as an

566
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:25,970


567
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,800
algorithm as

568
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,920
a countermeasure.

569
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,290
That's why I want to spread it to many people.  If

570
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:40,230


571
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,650
you don't do that, you'll have to follow the same pattern no matter what.

572
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,890


573
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:50,500


574
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,660


575
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:57,089
If you create a model that makes it difficult to remove the pattern like this, the

576
00:38:57,089 --> 00:38:58,500
delivery

577
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:05,430
will be strong.In addition, I think that the overseas model and the domestic model are very different.

578
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:10,980
When I come here, I'm actually in the process of researching,

579
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,790
but

580
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,920


581
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,490


582
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,240
even if I think that there will be quite a few worlds in the future that can't be seen just by looking at Aso's

583
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,410
shinto, I wonder if I have to look everywhere properly.

584
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:29,510
We are also in a picky place, and when you look at it, it's like this

585
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,440


586
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,660
.

587
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:41,010
I wonder if sky is

588
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,830


589
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,920
a way to demonstrate the power of emergency pants on the bridge

590
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,630


591
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,780
.

592
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,609


593
00:39:57,609 --> 00:40:01,210
It

594
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,770


595
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:09,610
's a story about the part that can't be seen unless you do something like processing the opening data, which is lined up in chronological order,

596
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:15,600
so you shouldn't be able to see it just by taking close-up shots.

597
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:22,000
Well, it's really hard to say that it's

598
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,720
drawn, but if you draw that large-scale idea, it's difficult if it's not like observation,

599
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,799
isn't it?

600
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,190


601
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,050


602
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,020


603
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,559


604
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,690
That sounds interesting.

605
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,700


606
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,819


607
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,730


608
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:02,770
Yes, it's early, it's an attack aircraft version, and it's possible that it will be used in the future

609
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,030


610
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,530


611
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,950


612
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,750
.  Yone Sodo 6 Phishing I've confirmed that it's being used,

613
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,089
but

614
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:23,430
ap how much it's been and how many of them have become doctors.

615
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,599
I'm not just

616
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,750
doing a little research, but if you look at what you say and do, you'll get interesting results.

617
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,700


618
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:35,970


619
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:42,359
This sort of time-series data

620
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:45,970
might be a good way to

621
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,230


622
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:50,930


623
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:58,650


624
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,030
disperse data.  It has to be the

625
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:06,080
God who opens the way. Medicine is interesting. It

626
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:12,770
moves fast.

627
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,810


628
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:23,890
I feel like I've come to understand quite a bit,

629
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:28,000
so I'm asking him to do research on that sort of thing

630
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,109


631
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:36,020


632
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,070
.  Music]

633
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:43,840
I'm going to use the money that comes from that characteristic

634
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:51,320


635
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,580


636
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:59,440
.  Do you want to be able to use it if you pay in virtual currency to other services that are used in that as-a-

637
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,200
service,

638
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,700
or did you

639
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:12,130
even try to do that, but after all, it's a tremendous amount of billions of dollars?  The way

640
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,230
you spend money will be

641
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,369


642
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:20,160
completely different, so

643
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,530
the big 4.0 that I uploaded in the previous Black Hat is honest.

644
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:29,970
In the

645
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,720


646
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,630
end, it was

647
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,570
billions of dollars at the time, but

648
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:44,400
at the time, Bidko had billions of dollars transferred through Roidation, so I wondered if he had a

649
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,730
loved one.  I don't think

650
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,030
it's profitable enough, but it's worth

651
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:55,360
investing in research and development costs.

652
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,950


653
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:15,790


654
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,030


655
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:25,510


656
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:30,540
Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, that's a little more, and

657
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:35,760
if you wait a budget on that close training side,

658
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,690
this is this.

659
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:42,140
No, look,

660
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:48,560
I'm worried just now. If you say you want to build an observation network, it'll cost a lot of money, but

661
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,400
maybe those people who do bad things like that are

662
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,630
going to make it now.  I waited for tomorrow and got a little spoiled

663
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,020
Yes, I'll give you double here ios

664
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,160
No

665
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,910


666
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,400


667
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,950


668
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,609


669
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:20,380
I've received my soul and received my license

670
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,560


671
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,119


672
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,819


673
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:32,670


674
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:40,140
.  It's fine, isn't it

675
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,910


676
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:47,230


677
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,630


678
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,200


679
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,119


680
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,450
brother?  And

681
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:05,519
I think we have to put in place a system that allows us to properly share good data

682
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:07,788


683
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,260


684

688
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,940


689
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:32,160
I think that there are some areas where we could take

690
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,510
action

691
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:41,090
ahead of time.  I have a feeling that it might have been the person who created the , and I think so too.

692
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,460


693
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,880


694
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,230
I

695
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,319
can't afford to spend more than that,

696
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:56,979
but I thought it was a good deterrent.

697
00:46:56,979 --> 00:46:57,850


698
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,839


699
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:05,910


700
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:13,769
I need to figure it out properly and do it, so I'm going to have to go so

701
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:20,249
far as to incorporate it into the debugger of a system that's good for two.

702
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:20,859


703
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:21,190


704
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,640


705
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,860


706
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,000
It's about whether or not you've digested everything up to that point.

707
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,750


708
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:35,010


709
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,550
That's why, as Mr. Kamizono just said, how good is

710
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:44,400
the pace and ration of AI-like systems

711

716
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:04,890
it hard,

717
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:09,259
you'll probably have to make money that doesn't go beyond the rack box, such as an AI model that has resistance to it, and doesn't go far from the rack box

718
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:15,670

Well, if the weird cakes were about 100 times what they are now, Dad, I should

721
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,410

722
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:32,950


723
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:36,820
I think it's a

724
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:41,680


725
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,670


726
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,760


727
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,270


728

729
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,760
really good project.  That being said,

730
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:08,059
I was able to do the initial design without Koshiba's addiction,

731
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:14,059
so I thought that's why the program seemed to be quite good,

732
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:19,010
but it's a bit of a stretch, but I think it's almost true

733
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:22,190
.  For example, trainers don't really want to come.

734
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,480


735
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,800


736
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,760


737
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:37,000


738
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,920
It's like looking back, isn't it? It's a

739
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,780
trainer,

740
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,050

743
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:02,180
n't it?  I don't mean to say

744
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,620
that it's impossible for each of

745
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,269
them

00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:26,309
Boo Boo For some

747
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:30,890
reason I feel like I have a different opinion

748
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,950
Thanks to the place, it's quite easy to do that way It's

749
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:39,109
like a total goal or a development process  Well

750
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:44,880
, it's been visualized, and it's been organized in a course-like format, so

753

I graduated without looking at the amp, and

754
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:03,510
my fortunes have played an active part, haven't they?

755
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,260
Yes, there are various academic societies, and when I told them that I bought it at a place with big fever,

756
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,210
I thought I'd seen it before, but it

757
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:14,700
's a camper and accuracy.

758
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:21,089
Just by saying that he's appearing at such an event, I'm

759
00:51:21,089 --> 00:51:22,910
pretty sure he

760
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,430
's an active student.

reverse technique, so I understand it's a world where there's a lot of attention at times, so it really doesn't look like a double-edged sword.

00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:40,140
I think I'd like to go back and try to hide the

858
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:50,250


859
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:54,180


860
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,360
elegance of being together.

861
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:05,839
Pensions and books are on the ridge oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and the book and the pension and the book

862
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,349


863
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:11,920


864
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,339


865
00:58:15,339 --> 00:58:17,370


866
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,970


867
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:24,069
I'm just an

868
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:29,370
art watcher who can't say things

869
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:36,559


870
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:41,150
smoothly.

871
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:47,569
That's

872
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:50,750


873
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:55,170


874
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:59,279


875
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:04,439
what I think  thank you very

876
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:06,469
much
