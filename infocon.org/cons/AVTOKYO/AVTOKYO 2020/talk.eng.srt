1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,110
Hello everyone, it's 2:30, so I'm back to

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:17,750


3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,430


4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,900
the talk.  I'd like to introduce you to a person called Konsei-san, who is going to play with the corner watch

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,480


6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,099


7
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,130


8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,630
.  On the other hand, I've been doing a little bit too,

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,160
but please listen to what I have to say about it.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,650


11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,260


12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,079
Please, is the

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,140
screen okay?

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,010


15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,820


16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:09,210


17
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,730
I'm doing it for a while, so I'm going to

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,620
look at this mountain dog around winter.

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,620


20
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:25,430


21
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,340
With this,

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,850
I would like to focus on the story of how things went well around early spring, and since then I

23
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:45,969
've searched for various things with my small friends and tried singing various things.

24
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:51,330
I've done a lot of Dopp I want to increase the number of friends I play with I heard how to play and I'll

25
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,360
introduce you

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,770


27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,000


28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,350
Eating a handshake I

29
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,650
capture it, but when I do that, I feel a

30
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,410
little cute, isn't it? z The name is everyone's favorite pawn and

31
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,310
Tamagotchi's tricks

32
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,870
.

33
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,910
In October of last year, Ebiu Socket in Italy announced a

34
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,830


35
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,030
version called Autumn 1.4 Sten.

36
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,180


37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,620


38
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,650
So, I tried to make a little and tried various things.  I'd like to introduce it as a social gathering, but

39
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,480
it's the spring of 2020, 2000.

40
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,629
From the 110th store city, I started to speak Japanese,

41
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,940
so the Imaki store became 5.3.

42
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:11,020
If

43
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:17,860
you have a Raspberry by Raspberry Pi 0 or something like that, the cpu is a bit poor, so

44
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,080
I think it's about time to take some time off

45
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,430
.

46
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,680
If you access it, you can download the image of the Raspberry Pi

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,250
by clicking on the release 1 point

48
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,629


49
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:39,970


50
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,080
5.32 from this cute picture.

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,069


52
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,420
You can do

53
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,640
it, and it's really fun to have ink.As for the

54
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,120
ink display, I recommend the 2.13 city black and white of the web share.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,819


56
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,170


57
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,000


58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,720


59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,108
It's one thing.

60
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,900
Ronnie's Ink Hatty is

61
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,388
also compatible with this ink display. Also,

62
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,449
it's a mobile battery.

63
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,990


64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,340
With 1000 milliampere hours,

65
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,380
you can work for more than 1 hour.

66
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,050


67
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,710
Well, if you don't mind, there is also this UPS light

68
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,919
.

69
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,650


70
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,070


71
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:12,660
It's an hour ampere, so

72
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,810
there are times when I don't have enough capacity

73
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:22,110
and I don't care

74
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,170


75
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,680
.

76
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,539
After writing the image file to the card, create a coffee mushy file in the fat area of ​​the sd card.

77
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,300


78
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,320


79
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,539


80
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,490


81
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,699
I'll do it again, even after starting in English,

82
00:05:52,699 --> 00:06:00,860
I changed the configtoms of this blue pooh and the clouds are output

83
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,129


84
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:09,759
.  This is what I saw at Kimikan, but the

85
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,260
owner is typing in the Deja Vu Sans maid font.

86
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:23,230


87
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,800


88
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,390


89
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,630
I wanted to do something about this,

90
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:38,900
so I analyzed the contents and tried to

91
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,820
tweak only the ui part.

92
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,470
I was able to make

93
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:55,040
it come out, so I tried it, and the German Mr. Takeshi Takeshi, who was looking at this

94
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,930
, improved the framework,

95
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,330
version i, and Japanese was displayed from the 10th shop city  Now I can do it beautifully

96
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,800
, so I reworked the Japanese lines a bit

97
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,389
.

98
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,449


99
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,750


100
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,540
I'll introduce you to the movement of

101
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:29,550
this one.Hey, when you wear an access point, you talk to him

102
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:35,520
Hey, hey, let's be friends with the access point.

103
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,740


104
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,930
Store the data as a pip cap file on the root hard shakes

105
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,780
Then you'll smile like there was a hard shell one time When you're

106
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,580
denied by the access point this

107
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,689
cool standard with sunglasses

108
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,089
this time pip  I'll save the guest file

109
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,569
Also, a

110
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:13,849
owner, I'm going to scan the 2.4 ghz band wi-fi channels

111
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:17,550
and look for access points

112
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,910


113
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,610


114
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:30,379
.  In addition, when I'm idle for a long time, I get irritated.In

115
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,789
this channel scan,

116
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,659
I do strange learning to find it efficiently.In the

117
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:49,529
first 30 minutes or so, I check and learn the activity status of the access points for each channel

118
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,670
.

119
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,639
Once this learning is complete, the ai mode will improve the efficiency of channel scanning

120
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,649


121
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:07,810
and save power.

122
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,930
It can also be used as electricity

123
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,390
.

124
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,260
You can check the expression of the You can check it with a

125
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,339
browser

126
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:29,680
Whether you connect with a PC or a smartphone, you can access with a url like this The

127
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,740


128
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,450
initial password is like this a In

129
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:44,390
this web ui, the auto mode activity status and  Manual mode

130
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:50,380
There is something called status standard mode, and you can switch between

131
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:57,410
these modes.This state is manual mode, and the status of the previous activity is displayed.

132
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,440


133
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,950
It will be in auto mode, so for those

134
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:13,410
who can't get good meat, it seems that it can be launched alone without a good mouth.

135
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,069


136
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:19,949


137
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:22,758
I'll let

138
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,880
you know.It's the default stop file.It's set in the web share v tool settings, so I

139
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,910
'm

140
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,800
waiting for a row at

141
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,330
the 24th

142
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,490
point.

143
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,940
To

144
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:53,100
24-pin Raspberry If you want to start up with a single Raspberry Pi without ras gloomy, I

145
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:01,340
think it's better to ground it here and maybe bg will be resolved and it will start up

146
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,430


147
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,010
.

148
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:16,030
When your friend's po man is nearby, use this function to make your friend's corner beetle

149
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,490
appear on the screen.

150
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:25,060


151
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,740


152
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,760
This is my teacher, the Prime Minister

153
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,980
of IoT.

154
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:51,780
The discovery function is found using a wi-fi day frame

155
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:57,360
Exchange the information of the found friend and leave the json file of the friend's id on the root peer I

156
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,740


157
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:06,150
still look lonely when I'm gone

158
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,220


159
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,160


160
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,680
There is a core part of the truth in this corner. It's

161
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,820
called Better Cap.

162
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,590
Redder Cap makes a man-in-the-middle attack.

163
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:30,980


164
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,240


165
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,070
The cap is working with an app called caplet The caplet in the

166
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:43,340
center of Po Nago is auto mode  There are two manual

167
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,579
modes.This and the main body

168
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:53,868
of the port will work together. Then create a screen and show the expressions on the wall and the ui

169
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,420
.  Way 1 It

170
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,570
's the world of

171
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,200
plugins There are official plugins and unofficial plugins

172
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,880
Both are python scripts

173
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:19,360
Plugins are the red circle on the far right of the web ui If you hit this plugin,

174
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,440
8 default plugins will appear.

175
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:31,350
There are a number of plug-ins available as standard, so you can check them. I'll

176
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,350
introduce a few of them

177
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,440
.

178
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,250


179
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,590
It's designed to acquire gps information when handshake.

180
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,590


181
00:13:54,590 --> 00:14:00,680


182
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,060


183
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,740


184
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,460
They are saved in songhwan format in the root handshake.The

185
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:20,830
location information is specified quite accurately, and when I tried it at my house, when I entered the coordinates on that google

186
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:27,660
map, my house was specified as much as I could.  Also,

187
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:35,190
there is a Groot tethering plug-in as a plug-in.

188
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,300
This is a smart phone's bluetooth

189
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,660


190
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:52,670
tethering.  I'm going to do pairing as it is on the day.

191
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,700
Now that I'm connected to the internet with

192
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,370


193
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,610
this NakanoThe time will be accurate.  Also,

194
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,899
if the

195
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:13,819
auto-update function is enabled, it will be updated to the latest status

196
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:15,430
.

197
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,290


198
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,640
You can exchange messages with

199
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,750
this bluetooth tethering There are coats that can be quite difficult depending on the model of your smartphone.

200
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,370


201
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:38,140


202
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,970


203
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,680
One of the pleasures of ooth tethering is pawn veil.

204
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,080
This qr code is my corner.

205
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,350


206
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,130


207
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,850
If you do

208
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,980
, you can specify the recipient here You can

209
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:11,790
specify this long number in the fingerprint and send the message The

210
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,100
message can be in Japanese

211
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:22,710
.  I'll let you know when there's a message.

212
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,540
Some

213
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,300
things seem to

214
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,149
be unofficial in the plug stomach.

215
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,199


216
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,430
If you

217
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:49,410
do that, you can set rice glitch disable in the web ui If you look at the

218
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:56,700
name, I think there is a plug-in that will pique your interest.

219
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,280


220
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,369
It works, so there will be more plugins

221
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:16,549
I will introduce the world of the community in a place where Poekokokoko is more fun right

222
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:21,380
here There is also an official community and a hero official

223
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,410
a

224
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,360
community There is an

225
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,150
official community lease course

226
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,779
This is when it was

227
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:40,850
born  There was a very lively discussion from the beginning until I was able to work stably.The

228
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:45,620
contents of various troubles are written, so

229
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,800
now it has become a faq-like existence.Everyone

230
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,500
loves slack.There is also slack.

231
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:05,010
Well, quite often the person who wrote the action will support us, so a common problem

232
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,870
with topix is ​​that bluetooth tethering doesn't work well.This is a

233
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,790


234
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,580
topic that comes up regularly.

235
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,650
This is the Discord plugin I'm using.

236
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,140
This is an unofficial chest. It's

237
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,410
been

238
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:36,070


239
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,230


240
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,350
actively discussed recently.

241
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,120
Insole the Discord plugin

242
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,300
and return the web hook 8 activity status

243
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,780
It's a

244
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,860
web hooker, and it's done by children.

245
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:04,139


246
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,870


247
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,100
I would also like to talk about analysis

248
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,090
Minna Daisuke Ahcrack ng and Hashcat can be used for analysis

249
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,120
.

250
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,739


251
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:33,000
There is a plug-in, and if you find a handshake on the main body of the po coach, it

252
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,540
will start Aclock ng and analyze it.

253
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:46,150


254
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:51,490
It takes about 6 minutes per round, so I don't recommend it

255
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,010


256
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:02,429


257
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:05,970
.

258
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:12,960
However, as those who have been there have

259
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,840
noticed, a key light

260
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,240


261
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,100
has already taken years to calculate it, so I don't have a good

262
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,120
gpu  However,

263
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:34,650
I was told that it would take decades.

264
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,850


265
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,820


266
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:49,700
By uploading the pp cap file to the site, you

267
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:57,170
can do something like distributed analysis.However, since this is a voluntary site that provides gpu resources, it seems that it will not be possible

268
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,400


269
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,919


270
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:05,840
without providing g view resources.  It's a mechanism that

271
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:14,300
's even more fun This is a 3 d printed case

272
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:21,400
3 deep Neat case can make a certain thing a little cooler

273
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,620
Well, if the board is exposed, you may feel a little resistance.

274
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,080
For

275
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,580
those who are concerned about the possibility of a mysterious reset due to a hit

276
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,830
, we recommend the 3d printed case.

277
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,640
You can also download the

278
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,960


279
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,870
print data.It can be displayed in a cute way that can be clearly seen according to the type of ink.

280
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,240


281
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,700
It

282
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,970
's full of hand-made feel, but it's all in a nice way.

283
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:18,220
So far, I've introduced you to the ways to enjoy Pau here and there.

284
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,000


285
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,559


286
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,990


287
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,970


288
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,179
Flying radio waves make me want to catch them, so I

289
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:39,630
think the feeling of catching handshakes is exactly like collecting insects.

290
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,419


291
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:46,899
It's fun to meet a handshake that makes you think a little bit more about fun things It

292
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:51,899
's fun for people

293
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:58,210
only Let's go out together

294
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,870


295
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,590


296
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,580
I'd like to introduce places where there are

297
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,029
cafe shopping malls in station buildings, and

298
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:17,059
hotels.

299
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:20,450


300
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:26,330


301
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,700


302
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,450
There's a handshake right

303
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,330
now Don't forget to wear a mask This is the

304
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,880
last page Some

305
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,800
jet owners have a fun pet they want to take out with them.

306
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,980


307
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,400


308
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,010
Thank you very much Thank you Thank you Thank you very much

309
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,950


310
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,740


311
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,950


312
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,700


313
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:29,240


314
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,570
Thank you very

315
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,240
much.

316
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,530


317
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,950


318
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,809
I think

319
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:11,450
these two are the two people who are active in the family human resource development program for boat No. 36, which is being implemented by nict.

320
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,840


321
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,450


322
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,710
Mr. Shibatsuji 6.Is it

323
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,980


324

all right with the preparations

325

? Yes, it's fine.

326
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,490


327
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,330
Wait a

328
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,900


329
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,970
minute, will the screen stand out, and can

330
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,680


331
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,370


332
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,410

333
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,280

336
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,620

myself.  I'm overwintering with my university affiliation Thank you.

338
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,889


339
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,419


340
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:20,600


341
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,590


342
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:26,539
But from next year, I will be a first-year graduate student at Nagoya University, so

343
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:30,950
if you are particular about it, please support me.

344
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,410


345
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,330


346
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,629


347
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:47,080
This image is the first thing that comes to my mind when I talk about eight times, but

348
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,260
I think many people

349
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,660
think it's just a room.  It's made up

350
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,700
of videos with virtual backgrounds,

351
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,770
so what's going on with this announcement?

352
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,370


353
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,710


354
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,690


355
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,990


356
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,770


357
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,600


358
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,680
I would be surprised if this happened in Hawaii, but please light one after another

359
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,539


360
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,469


361
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:08,700


362
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,869
.  zoom g is

363
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:18,080
a tool that automatically restores the room hidden behind by extracting the color information of the boundary between the virtual background and objects such as the body

364
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,250


365
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:38,659
.  but  aki It's an angry patty,

366
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:39,139
but

367
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:41,430
it's also in the epub, so if you want to use it, you

368
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,900
can do this 9 a 8, so please try flying

369
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,930


370
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,310
.  Please

371
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,750


372
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,410
go to the next slide.

373
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:06,860


374
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,870


375
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,960
8 The zoom doesn't keep up with the 8 movements

376
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,680
. I think that when you open it, it shakes and you can see a little information about the room behind it, but I

377
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,850
thought I'd reconstruct this and identify the room.  This is the concept for this time.

378
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,870


379
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,880


380
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,010


381
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:37,730


382
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,260


383
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:48,110
Moreover, the result of the experiment was that we were able to restore it to the extent that we could almost

384
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,870


385
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:54,770
see the back.

386
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,680


387
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,390
It's a story about restoring, but the samples and tickets that appear here are provided by

388
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:07,230


389
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,160
Hanyu.

390
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,270


391
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,370
First of all, let's go with an ideal video.

392
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:22,620


393
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,660


394
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,410


395
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:33,960
What this represents is that the red color is the virtual background, and

396
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:40,020
the yellow color is the object or body.

397
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,610


398
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,030
You may think that

399
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,280
this is

400
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,910
not something you usually do, but in that case, you can say yes

401
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,380
, please

402
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,400
go get some tea, and go to the bathroom.  Since it's called a mast, I'm assuming that it's going to cross, and if we

403
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,800
apply this

404
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:04,230
to our algorithm that automatically restores it, we can see the room behind it like the one on the right, even if it's

405
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,990
not perfect.  This

406
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,770


407
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,130
is a detailed explanation

408
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:20,420
of the weakening of the algorithm.

409
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:26,240
That's because you keep looking at each constant part frame by frame,

410
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,380


411
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,470
so after 1 second, seconds 53 seconds, this kind of

412
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,610


413
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,870
recognition is fine.  The

414
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:43,170
first one is all bright red with a lot of red, and the second one is mostly red with a little light blue color and yellow on

415
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,580
the right.

416
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,210
And since

417
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,240


418
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,920
the room behind is quickly hidden by the virtual background,

419
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,600
the mysterious color information of the original room is very small.

420
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,930
Accumulate this over time and take the least frequent one

421
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,720


422
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,570
So, the coordinates below are Southern European countries, but this is the result of applying the algorithm I just entered to a certain pixel, starting

423
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:12,909


424
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:18,879
from the left and going right.  The video is

425
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:24,909
after the wintering video The virtual exhaust continues to be projected from the left side of the date, and suddenly the

426
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:30,429
room is shown for a moment, then the Bobject is shown, then the room is shown again, and after that, it's all a virtual background, and

427
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:31,760
so

428
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,740
on.  As you accumulate, it will look like this.It is very easy to select a room from here.You

429
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,740
can see that all you have to do is choose this blue color

430
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,940
.

431
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,730


432
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:51,370
Next, I would like to talk about the implementation. The technologies and languages ​​used this time

433
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,689
are as follows.

434
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,159


435
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,049
Because it is published as an 8 pi pi package

436
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:09,859


437
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:13,940
, the 8 library can be loaded only near the import zoom g on the left.

438
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,219
First

439
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,340
, create an object from the zoom tea class.

440
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:24,550
First

441
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,739
, create an array for 8 generated satellite images

442
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:33,270
This is the restored image that you want to finally output, isn't it

443
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,239
?

444
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,730
Create an array for management This is the algorithm that I explained earlier, the

445
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:46,100
frequency of appearance is the key, so the array for managing that frequency of appearance

446
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,330
.

447
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,830


448
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:54,000
I

449
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,870
'm creating branches in parallel for the number of times the height of the video is the width

450
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:02,160


451
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,540


452
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:13,140
.  You can easily get the appearance frequency of 8

453
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,500


454
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,710


455
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:28,500
by using the dream library.  I'll get the frame of the video. I'll pass the acquired frame to the

456
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,440
zoom g object at the time

457
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,970


458
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:42,440
of zooming as a known add image method.

459
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,450
In order to manage the appearance frequency, it counts up. It's

460
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,279
simply

461
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,580
incremented by one.The next part is the part that generates the image.This

462
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,560
is an argument with a parameter.

463
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,680
Um, first of all, if you look at the depopulation of corners, if

464
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,280
you do this, the timing of appearance will be sorted in advance

465
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,960


466
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,510
.

467
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,880
Look at this and that sequence one by one and look at the battles one by one

468
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,950
and calculate the 8 similarity.

469
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:31,370


470
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:38,690
What we are doing is that the most recent thing is the virtual background, and

471
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,250
we assume that it is a

472
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:47,300
completely different color from the virtual background and has the lowest frequency of appearance.  8

473
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,220
I think another id is to calculate similarity for one song,

474
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:52,470
but

475
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:58,650
this one uses cos similarity 8 Each pixel is an

476
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,530
rgb woman.  I think it will be 3 vectors or so, but I

477
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,450
wanted to calculate the similarity of 8 vector years, so I used the most popular and famous

478
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,770
5000 yen similarity.

479
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,090


480
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:23,070
If you get that array of images  It's ok After that, open cv again, but it doesn't matter

481
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,910
.

482
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:29,839
8If we save the image, we can see

483
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:36,980


484
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,390
the image.  When the width of the moon is w,

485
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,369
the order fhw is about the fhw of the blog.This log is a

486
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:48,780
branching log in parallel.

487
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,840


488
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,860
The width of the wood body

489
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,710
8 I roughly estimated the number of calculations

490
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,849
. Well, the horizontal axis is time.

491
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:09,430
It requires about nine operations

492
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,020


493
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,070
, so it is clear that the algorithm of type 1000 is also quite heavy

494
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,790
.

495
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,680
Next, regarding the evaluation of the algorithm, this time we also considered various

496
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,700
alborates, etc.

497
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,320
8 parameters  It was necessary to evaluate the algorithm when adjusting and so on

498
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,010


499
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,960


500
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,440


501
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,450


502
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:48,630
.  Prepare a comprehensive video background and 8 restored images created from that video

503
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:55,470
Go through each pixel in these two images and then

504
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:01,200
wait 3 times more than 0.999 The needle almost matches  If it's ok, if it's

505
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,470
not, ng, we

506
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:07,379
've calculated the 8

507
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,900
accuracy.

508
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,640


509
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,780
It's just a story,

510
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,859
so I don't know if it can be applied to a fundamentally different algorithm,

511
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:27,130
so I would be grateful if you could listen to it with that

512
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,170
in mind.

513
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,820
If so, I'm sure you've noticed, but I think

514
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,400
it would be good to make it into a video

515
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,300
.

516
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,580
It

517
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,160
is correct to say that the probability of making two videos is low.

518
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,460
I was able to get the matter, and

519
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:04,670
it's a looping video in a

520
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:09,660


521
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,150


522
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:14,779


523
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,959
short time.  Since the same bits are added every time in a video that

524
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:22,489
does, there is a problem that the background of the room is selected as a result.

525
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:26,659


526
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:32,390
There is no option to make it an image, and I'm thinking

527
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,800
of a protective gear for restoration, such as making it a video and using my favorite images

528
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,440
.

529
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,490


530
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,040
This is what I came up with.It

531
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,140
says "noise on a frame-by-frame basis", but I thought that if I put noise in each virtual background for just one frame for a

532
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,720
moment,

533
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,920
that noise would be picked up.

534
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,310


535
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:02,340
I devised it as a concrete example. If you put in just one frame like this,

536
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,630
please show me the next slide.

537
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:11,240


538
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,370
I think so, but in an actual room,

539
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,290


540
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:23,630
I think I was able to interfere to such an extent that I couldn't even

541
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,740


542
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,550
tell what was going on.  Since it is possible to find it,

543
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:35,790
it is shown that if you delete only that frame, it can be restored with the same amount of government as on the left

544
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,510


545
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,470
.

546
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:48,570
Here, it is written as noise in pixel units, but what about

547
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,849
this red virtual background written as shown

548
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:56,660


549
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:03,610
in the image?  Assuming that the noise that is not worthy of souvenirs is thrown into the

550
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:09,840
sky, as the next white please

551
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,000
, the

552
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,040
noise will spread like a moving object above.

553
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,390
It is an algorithm in which the accuracy of restoration increases as the length of the video increases,

554
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,349
but it is a

555
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:27,650


556
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,799
floor that can prevent our algorithm, such as increasing noise interference.

557
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:34,489
As I

558
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:40,009
showed earlier earlier, the colors of a certain big cell are arranged chronologically, and each

559
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:42,480
vertical line is

560
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,880
the most frequent in all of Izu.  I think you can see that if you select things that are less in the background, the noise will be selected

561
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,710


562
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,130


563
00:42:54,130 --> 00:43:00,749


564
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,589
.  There

565
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:11,779
is only one sheet of green cat paper, so the information behind it will not be leaked, so if you are worried

566
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:13,999
, please buy it instead of adding

567
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:17,618
noise.I think you can buy it cheaply on Amazon.

568
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,960
I would like to talk about it.

569
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,250
Yes, using the algorithm I mentioned earlier,

570
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,910
this is a video of a special product

571
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,910


572
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,599


573
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:48,109
.  I think that that part is well restored.I

574
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,420


575
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,309
also tried the method of preventing two cases by inserting noise, which I explained earlier

576
00:43:58,309 --> 00:43:59,299


577
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:02,299


578
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:07,520
.  However, I don't think the image with German noise will bother you at all

579
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,359
.

580
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,280


581
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,490


582
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:22,310


583
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:23,530


584
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,730
For those who melted quickly, maybe

585
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:30,260
Yusei-san gave you some points.

586
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:34,020


587
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,440


588
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,460


589
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,170


590
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:47,339


591
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,839
Thank you very much.

592
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,510


593
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:02,720
Thank you very much.

594
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,040


595
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,520


596
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,650
I think it would be very difficult to make an announcement at different places because of Air's grudge while doing something a little different, but

597
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:17,050
I didn't feel nervous, and I think it was an interesting announcement.

598
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,310
It's

599
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:27,040
fine, but I think it's about time for

600
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,600
the discord to be released.

601
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,310
I think it would be nice if you could have a look at the last word from each of you

602
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,730


603
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:47,530
, would

604
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:50,680


605
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,349
you mind?  Let's have fun with everyone so that we don't have to. Afterwards, please take a look at our announcement

606
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:58,420


607
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,930


608
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:05,990
. Thank you.

609
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,170


610
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:13,040
If you are a ctf like this, I hope you will enjoy it. Thank you

611
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,950


612
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:25,230
.  Well, the channel

613
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:29,640
will remain as it is, so the main program will switch to 8 various programs.There are also

614
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,740
various channels such as boys floating and text channels

615
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:39,510
on Discord, so I hope you will enjoy those as well.

616
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:39,940
But

617
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,140
I'll continue the freezer channel as a dj time,

618
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,279
so please look forward to it.
