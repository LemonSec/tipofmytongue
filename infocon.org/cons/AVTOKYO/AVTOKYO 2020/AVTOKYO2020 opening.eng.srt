00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,090
Hey, boo boo

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,960
1, then Tokyo 2

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,299
Hello, then

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:21,330
no, no, isn't it the main thing to go from end to end?

5
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:44,199


6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:02,230


7
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,009


8
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:12,140


9
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,260


10
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,260


11
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,710
I wonder what it's like to be in far away ab Tokyo

12
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,670
.

13
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,780


14
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,070
It's all unusual for a school fishing star, isn't it?

15
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,020


16
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,510


17
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,400


18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,230


19
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,920


20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,110


21
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,430


22
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,400


23
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:19,740


24
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,810
I think there are some things I don't understand in the 4 Joiners a 1 common Venty Trendy Buber lesson style, so I'm going in from

25
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,190
my brain.

26
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,800


27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,190
I want to go home, so please come back online again After

28
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,050
all, that kind of Miss Hashimasudomo pass pashi pashi pashi pashi Even if I get

29
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,150
it, it's 6 I feel like I have to get excited by myself

30
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,480
That's good

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,130
Boo Boo It's

32
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,520
good if Kunizaki says it's going to start Yes, I'm right now

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,780
.

34
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,670
And then

35
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,990
16 yes yes

36
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,590
I can't go with my eyes at 5 o'clock It's stupid

37
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,190
, so please watch from the 16th I'll use the switch with Fein to taste the flavor

38
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,250
I understand

39
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,960


40
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,850
If you just look at the timetable, you'll understand if that content is played or not If you just look at the notification, the main

41
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,700
stream is

42
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,260
a tunneler.

43
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,519
I was embarrassed to try it out, but you can do it with a text,

44
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,160
and I think it would be great if you could have various exchanges in various places.

45
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,400


46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,730

Oh, and it's fun, isn't it?  I'm sorry for Hong Kong.

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,120


51
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,720

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,418
staff That's great staff I

55
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:25,090
can take it Well then there's a matter to be mastered already I can

56
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:31,240
only enter up to 99 people, so the early cherry blossoms are beautiful Lander

57
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,870
There is a possibility that the organizer of the meeting will be kicked out

58
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:41,930
.

59
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,250
The time has come for the g area to have more than 25 facial features.

60
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,790


61

63
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,330
It's okay, but

64
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,440
it's all about

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,470
today. Even today, even if you have some parks in the expedition,

66
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,529


67
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:16,150
each hair song is

68
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,580
flowing.  However,

69
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,849
there are various other events, too, right?

70
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:25,480


71
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,960


72

74
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:41,280
The cherry blossoms dance and come back a I haven't gotten anything but the middle school marks yet, so I'll be able to go at all,

75
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,980
but it's better from before then

76
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,820


77
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,210


78

]

79
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,050
You understood I spoke English

80
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,949
Well then, it's all dandelions, okay? It's a charging stand.

81
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:06,470


82
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:12,910


83
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,160
Well, it's all right Well then, it's still a drool bg, isn't it?

84
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,540


85
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,460


86
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,400


87
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,150
I've got about a question, so

88
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,370
oh yes, I've arrived at Tambour and Western music

89
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,420
Ah, it

90
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,470
's fun even on the other side.

91
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,130


92
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,660


93
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,650
Do you have books

94
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,409


95
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:59,020


96
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,840


97
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,900
?  It's until 7 o'clock,

98
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,160
and then it's 3 more

99
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,740
hours with Garair, isn't it?

100
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,550


101
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,650


102
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,889


103
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,520
I think I'm going through Registone with my car It would be nice if you could register and take on the challenge, right

104
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,500


105
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,720


106
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,229

111
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,720
yes next time next time let's feel the shock of the event

112
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,260


113
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,500


114
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,889


115
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:18,610


116
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,870
Well, I can tell you the reason why I'm fishing.  So, in the first half of the talk,

117
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:29,129
from 4:30 there's a workshop.It's a good chance to have a

118
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:34,809
workshop.I'm sure that fishing group will come and take a bath with

119
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,250
that powerful tendency.It's

120
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,370
interesting, but I don't know if I can do it.  That's

121
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,960
right, I didn't expect you to do it, but

122
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,490
ah, Roscoe, the

123
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,010
amazing offer was successful, and the two-and-a-half-hour workshop

124
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,140
was a perfect match.

125
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,440
Ohka, it's okay to come here, isn't it?

126
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,620


127
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,590


128
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:25,290
From the lecturer to the wintering tree pub lady, both Japanese and English explanation materials

129
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,329
are prepared, so

130
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:29,480
if you look at it, even

131
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,800
if you don't have any special preparations at hand, you should read the materials

132
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,379
.

133
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:42,220
Well, there are some tools, so I think I saw it in the example, but I think it's armor.

134
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,489


135
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,379


136
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:52,579

the Senate as soon as you can.  Is that the

143
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,510
source? It's all about talking about things that are quite difficult to talk about here

144
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,589
My recommendation for that

145
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:36,220
talk is that council Earthquake countermeasures council people are getting worse Lampang carrying that story Oh
