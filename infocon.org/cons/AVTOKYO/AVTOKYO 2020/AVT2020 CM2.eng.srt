1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,879
The team is a legend Matsushita, huh?

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,650


3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,190
Actually, it's the number one recommendation

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,049


5
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:21,260
.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,539
Oh

7
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,749
yeah

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,489
Bouba-shaped blue thing After

9
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:46,640
all, that ap Tokyo-style 1-type blue,

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,670
what kind of thing do you put

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,040
in it

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,880
?

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,120


14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,309
5 Honestly, it was cuter than I thought

15
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:07,850
.

16
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,200


17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,110


18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,060
It's a pity, isn't it a case c

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,509


20
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:34,149


21
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:52,860
?  It's a

22
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,590
little hard to see because

23
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,350


24
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:06,860
the image is embedded in between.

25
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,220
If you keep it in

26
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,910
place, it's fertilized inside the shield crab, and it's about 20 centimeters underground, just under

27
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,810
9

28
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:38,100
centimeters wide

29
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,600


30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,820
.

31
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,860
Well, I have to drink, so there's a variety of places,

32
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,210
but it's mostly a glass type and a mug in the

33
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,650
back, and it's a power pop.

34
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,590


35
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,040


36
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,080


37
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,150
I can't do it, it's not complete, right? Yes, I probably have colored

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,819


39
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,960


40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,430


41
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:30,930
chairs.  What did you do with the feeling that you knew you hit the

42
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,560
wrong beer

43
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,560


44
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,819


45
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:59,720


46
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,470
holder?  Moa  It seems like it's going to

47
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,080
happen There are a few places, is

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,590


49
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,010


50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,390


51
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,120
n't it?

52
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,900
Thank you, stand up

53
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,889
