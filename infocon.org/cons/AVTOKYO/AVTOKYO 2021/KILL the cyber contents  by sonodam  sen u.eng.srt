1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,460
By any chance,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,999
it's been a bad flow since then, and I

3
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:07,720
wonder if

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,540
our Sonoda-san and I

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,540
are fans of the eyes, so please wear a chorus and a poncho.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,300


7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,990


8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,490


9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,950


10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,150


11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,810
It's been

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,930


13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,390


14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,300


15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,280
about 7 years since Ati Michimura Diplos.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,130


17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,640


18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,450


19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,489
I've been doing it for about 10 years, with 10 people at the annual festival.

20
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:00,470


21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,309


22
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:07,340


23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,810


24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,050


25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,070


26
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,960


27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,770
Oh yeah, it's kind of like that now. It's not

28
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,820


29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,530
so rare for characters to appear now,

30
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,659
but

31
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:30,320
it was

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,409
n't that way back then.  I really didn't have any material, so how many times did you say sa

33
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:35,780
?

34
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,980


35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,430


36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,829


37
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,320


38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,530
Right now, even if it's dark right now, it's dark

39
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,280


40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,250
right now.

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,119


42
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,560


43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,900


44
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,810


45
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,110


46
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,790
That's a little bit of a tour After

47
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,640
all, Tom Hanks is also a mother.

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,060


49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,730


50
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,319


51
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,540


52
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,180
I think so, first of all, don't call me

53
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,420
Frank, because it's a

54
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,689
user who wears a pilot's school uniform

55
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:33,870
, so I'm half-hearted.

56
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,959


57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,910
It's like the first bullet, is

58
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,940


59
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,569


60
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,609


61
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:51,430
n't it?

62
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,300


63
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,680


64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,470
It's definitely better to eradicate 2  003

65
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,560
hmmm, it wasn't enough to catch it for about 3 years

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,670


67
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,290


68
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,810


69
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,390


70
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,470
.

71
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,830


72
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,180


73
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,550
There

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,240


75
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,730
was a problem with another version of the app,

76
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,660
but this version is

77
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,520


78
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,990


79
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,120


80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,489


81
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,450
2.54.

82
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,140
Hey, but that movie 99 or something,

83
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,680
wasn't it? At first, the Aso movie was with my sister.

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,810


85
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,849


86
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,849


87
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,250


88
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,130
Aside from that,

89
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,620
as a hacking process, it's quite long

90
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,740
, and it's familiar, or rather, it's

91
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,780
like doing a port scan to find

92
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,360


93
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,250


94
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,890


95
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,080
out.

96
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,480
It seems like there is no

97
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,000
option to share and stand up

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,550


100
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,380


101
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,210
I don't know

102
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,230


103
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,230
what it's like to have a chair sa

104
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,620
just because there's land, but I'll attack ss 1

105
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,240
and take it away

106
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,350


107
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,620


108
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,210
.  2 lures say

109
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,199
sane I probably scanned

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,649
and searched for various vulnerabilities, and at that time

111
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:13,919
there was a crc 32 attack of the latest ssh vulnerability around 2001.

112
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,929


113
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,989
Ryu and Ken also did that.

114
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:21,719


115
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:24,539


116
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,690
It's a tool with some vulnerabilities, but it seems like it's a

117
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,210
power plant or something, so I'm a

118
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,169


119
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,360
member.  Or

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,129
, since it's an internal network,

121
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,289
it feels like it's just new,

122
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,550
isn't it?

123
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,550


124
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,310


125
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,330
It's the base, but

126
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,569
that retro is a virtual space in the world of

127
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,110


128
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,810


129
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,650
seasonal festivals.

130
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,500


131
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,440
I showed him the process of Matsuto, which started out as a feeling,

132
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,690
so

133
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,670
I felt quite the opposite of reality in clothes,

134
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,110
but yeah,

135
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,989
surprisingly, there

136
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:18,989
weren't many commandos at the time, so if you say old movies,

137
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:21,209
that password is usually the same.

138
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:23,249
It's called Round and Round,

139
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,729


140
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,599
and there were a lot of things like specific strings, and in the game I played,

141
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,669
Ashley, it's a certain game, isn't it?

142
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:34,129


143
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:37,309


144
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:39,739
It was a

145
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:42,860
bit strange, but it was

146
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,960
fashionable, but at that

147
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,500
time, tcpip was just coming out

148
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,840
, and dial-up was at 7:00,

149
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,820
was

150
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,230
n't it?

151
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,910
I thought it was a game, but it's a strategic core,

152
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,000
isn't it?

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,970


154
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,900


155
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,040


156
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,699
It's a password.

157
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:18,129


158
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:19,509


159
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,270


160
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,729


161
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,860


162
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,930


163
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,599
It's interesting, isn't it? Because I

164
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,930
wear it, who's on that phone is like my brother?

165
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,910


166
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,640


167
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,129


168
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,529


169
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:50,020


170
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,830
If you're a person, you should take a look at it once, isn't it?

171
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,939


172
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:00,169


173
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:02,749


174
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,430


175
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,600


176
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,680
There are things like old things, that kind of consistency.

177
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,620


178
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,889


179
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,190


180
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,530


181
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,410


182
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,290
and  I

183
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,140

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,660
?  It might be fine, but at that time,

200
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,810
that

201
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,180

Icarus Rice is brewing,

219
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,200
isn't it?

220
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,259


221
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,269


222
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,089


223
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:29,949
But of course, I also use

224
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:32,709
penetration tests to infiltrate customers,

225
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:35,680
but in the end I often end up using simple passwords or

226
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,110
passwords, so I don't feel like the tricks I used to introduce them are

227
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,730
very similar to hacking movies

228
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,860
.  Hey,

229
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,570
no, in the sense that something like that can be done

230
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,720


231
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,240
unexpectedly, I want it to be a relatively faithful representation of reality,

232
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,110
isn't it?

233
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,060


234
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,250


235
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,620
However, in reality,

236
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,700
it seems like that's the case after all.It seems that

237
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,870
this interesting and unusual envy is taken up

238
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,180
by Shinichi Hoshi and

239
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,900
Aoi, who has a voice called Ami in the novel, and it was 70

240
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,390
years ago, 1970, but of course at this time it was the

241
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,980
Internet.  Of course, it's an era where there is no such thing as the

242
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,500
web, but

243
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,050
this kind of thing is 3, so it's a knitted web, the

244
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,840
current web

245
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,170


246
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,980
.  But I have a suggestion

247
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,090
, in

248
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,250
a world where

249
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,420
it would be nice to have a database

250
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,019
of all sorts of things on the phone, and what is that memory bank?

251
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,939


252
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:52,209
I wrote something that I ca

253
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,069
n't forget, and

254
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:57,160
I registered that personal information and him there

255
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,540


256
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,769


257
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:01,929


258
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,810
.

259
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,700
I

260
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,620
think it's pretty amazing that the next time the computer

261
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,660
wakes up, it's like sci-fi

262
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,440
, but in the end, if it's

263
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,900
hijacked, I'll know.

264
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,560


265
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,490


266
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,700


267
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,990


268
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,100
Well, that star is a very typical example.

269
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,529


270
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:35,779


271
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:36,940


272
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,950


273
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,620
It's a game, isn't it? There are works

274
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,190
that send objections, but that's also a

275
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,850
big satellite operated by SNS.

276
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,460


277
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,100


278
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,110


279
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,930
In other words, it

280
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,510
enhances this idea,

281
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,410
and moreover, the brain's

282
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,490
imagination is surprisingly capable

283
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,980


284
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,930
of foreseeing reality.

285
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,810


286
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,690
It's like a sci-fi writer's

287
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,110
imagination Using

288
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,329
that as a clue for real innovation It's

289
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:23,100
like yellow more and more

290
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,410
I've come up with some kind of way of thinking

291
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,110
ss

292
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,209
I thought it was interesting as a subject, but there's

293
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,109
also a flow

294
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,150
Well, in that sense, there have been some foresight works in the

295
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,070
past, have

296
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,270


297
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,540
n't

298
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,809


299
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,399


300
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,820


301
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,760
they

302
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,440
?  That was interesting,

303
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,320
yes, the card is also good.

304
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,020


305
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,920


306
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,710


307
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,000


308
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,230
Why don't you talk about this kind of work

309
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,270
?  Well, actually, here

310
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,910
's what I'm going to buy using social media, but since the topic was canceled at this time, it's a

311
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,180
black box that's expensive

312
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,060
, and

313
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,149
it's a code-breaking machine that instantly picks up any cipher in the world.  At

314
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,339
that time, about 20,008 people wrote that they were

315
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,130


316
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,740
deciphering it with a quantum computer

317
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,880


318
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,540


319
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,940


320
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,950
.

321
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,410
I wrote that it might be a quantum computer in the study of

322
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,460


323
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,040
the generative system woman

324
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,700


325
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,120


326
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,690


327
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,090


328
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,280
.  Maybe it's the performance

329
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,440
, or maybe it's this person, or maybe it's a blind person who hacks, but it's not like they're using 10 people's keyboards, so it's not like it's a crowd, and it's a person

330
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,870


331
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,810
who has red

332
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,620
apnea.  Level:

333
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,260
I thought that

334
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,830
kind of thing was cool, and I thought that device was amazing, so I watched

335
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,980
it.

336
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,220


337
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,490
That's what

338
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,290
it is, the production is really cool, isn't

339
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,380
it?

340
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,020


341
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,000


342
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,100


343
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,130


344
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,310
I'm not a Liberal Democrat, so

345
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,590
I'm probably about the same.

346
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,930


347
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,860


348
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,889


349
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:15,359


350
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,129
You're going home

351
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:19,640
Hey, that's fine,

352
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,910
I guess that's

353
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,220


354
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,460
right.

355
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,870


356
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,080


357
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,750
I wondered if it would be helpful for that kind of production, but

358
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,240
that's also kind of frozen,

359
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,449
but

360
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:46,579


361
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:49,580


362
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,800
it's not really.

363
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,290
It sounds like an attack That's right, isn't it?

364
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,060


365
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,590


366
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,110


367
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,470
We're going to match from the end,

368
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,089


369
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,410


370
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,160
don't you?

371
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,270


372
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,069


373
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,140


374
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,150


375
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,890
In Terminator 2,

376
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,140
I'm already hacking my house Tim

377
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,839
Edward Furlong, that one too

378
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,750


379
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,920
Come to think of it, the numbers are gradually rubbing

380
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,700
.

381
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,090


382
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,360


383
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,340
When I was looking at child information, I thought, "Pain," or something like

384
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,440


385
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,960
that drawer, but who

386
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,659


387
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:56,100


388
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,890
is

389
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,520
it?  Ah,

390
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,450
especially in the past, there

391
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,470
may have been quite

392
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,650


393
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,980
a lot

394
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,580


395
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,500


396
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,320
of depictions like that.  Asami,

397
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,230


398
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,760
um, why rsa, you're ripping off, are

399
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,169
n't you?

400
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:27,429


401
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:31,930


402
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,310


403
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,440


404
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,840


405
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,169
Are you watching? Yes, you gave me 20050. If you

406
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:48,650
're white, you're doing great work. It

407
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,970
's a

408
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,120
wonderful story that

409
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,550
you can make games with this, and I think it was quite interesting that transportation and virtual space came out

410
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,180
.

411
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,779
I think that it

412
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,399


413
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:05,309


414
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:07,590
was really interesting.

415
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,710


416
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,690


417
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,019


418
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:19,530
There was a house that looked like

419
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,260


420
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,960


421
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,060


422
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,950


423
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,539
Kurakazama.  The paradise production method itself

424
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,690
, but there's a hacking scene, of course,

425
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,410
that human being, even though it's a virtual space,

426
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,950


427
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,460
he's doing things like touching things with his hands.

428
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,950


429
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,070
I think I forgot a bit

430
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,190
, but that umbrella usually has 5

431
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,789
fingers, isn't it?

432
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:03,630


433
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,090


434
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,230
I'm banging the keyboard

435
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:29,970
so much It seems like 8 goons are putting in Buber

436
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,050
, but it's different if it's not a person who's a nuisance of luck

437
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,480
.

438
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,840


439
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,169
I

440
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:46,290


441
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,960
don't think it will work even if I wear a future called exponential.

442
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,630


443
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,870


444
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,360


445
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,970
I mean, it's directly connected, but

446
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,600
I think it's because of the

447
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,110


448
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,390
Ghost in the Shell, isn't

449
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,510


450
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,639
it?

451
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,999


452
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,970


453
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,570
That's what

454
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,750


455
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,900


456
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,190
I feel.

457
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,320


458
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,130


459
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,820
Now

460
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,870
everyone, there are a lot of people who sell at that amazing crackling speed, but in

461
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,000
the past,

462
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,780
typing software,

463
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,370
oh, oh

464
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,870
, did you prevent me from entering with noon?

465
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,660


466
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,800


467
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,280


468
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,929


469
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:09,100
I thought it was normal to use fire for things like heat, and

470
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,880
I thought it was well done, wasn't it?

471
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,020


472
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,380


473
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,710


474
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,260
It's going down

475
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,390


476
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,210
I thought I was going to eat something like

477
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,070
dc jack.

478
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,870


479
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,269


480
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:38,330


481
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,659


482
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,690
Well, it doesn't matter at all, because construction is

483
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,830
based on

484
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,800


485
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,040
language.

486
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,330


487
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,050


488
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:01,530


489
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:04,210
It's a sound device that attracts a lot of attention.

490
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,169


491
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:08,629


492
00:23:08,629 --> 00:23:11,469


493
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,570
Boo Boo csi series

494
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:23,229
Satie gave up all the time

495
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:29,179
Atiya user interface first

496
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,220
Athens ki Chiaki Cost

497
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,050
There was a display in

498
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,930
front of it with a keyboard or a mouse

499
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,840
, but

500
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,830


501
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,740
eventually it became a touch display.  The fact that the touch display

502
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,630
can be seen from behind the screen is

503
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,210
something that has gradually evolved in various

504
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,490


505
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,040
ways.

506
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,500


507
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,620
It was strangely naive, was

508
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,050
n't it? The monitor is getting thinner, is

509
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,540


510
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,730
n't it?

511
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,679


512
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:15,520


513
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,450


514
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,580


515
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,120
You didn't leave Suma, did you? Ah 4, I did

516
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,880
n't foresee what the world would be

517
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,010
like after

518
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,650
that.

519
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,260


520
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,750


521
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,130


522
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,490
So, I thought it was pretty shocking, or amazing,

523
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,000
to be able to

524
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,850
do so

525
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,550


526
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,380
many things.

527
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,060


528
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,620
Well, I dare say that there was a long time ago

529
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,919
Newton

530
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,830
mute Hayashi Hey, do you want to do it too?

531
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,899


532
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,149


533
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:04,580


534
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,429


535
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:09,379
Well,

536
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:14,110
I have Raurus, and I want you to run a little bit around that area.Yeah,

537
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,390
Japan's Annaka is too fast, isn't it?

538
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,880


539
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,299


540
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,909


541
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:29,909
When I went to pick up a pen, it was

542
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:33,450
too loud, wasn't it?

543
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,929


544
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:39,420


545
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,850


546
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,100


547
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,510


548
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,020
After that, there's a guy who wants something more like a lager,

549
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,299
or something like

550
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:55,240
that.

551
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,039
It's going to be

552
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,270
Hiroshi Mori, is

553
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,250
n't

554
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,340


555
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,809


556
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:08,519
it

557
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,879


558
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:15,399


559
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:16,640
?  I'm telling you,

560
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,000
this is a work from 1994,

561
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,270
but I think it came out like unix or something like that

562
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,020


563
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,000
.

564
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,580


565
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,350


566
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,530


567
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,640
It's a

568
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,940
beautiful voice, so

569
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,700


570
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,230
I want a police officer.

571
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,390


572
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,820
Oh, but it's okay, but

573
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,000


574
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,360
it's a place that's isolated from the parliament, and

575
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,150
it's like you're living in a place that's under strict surveillance

576
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,220
.

577
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,380


578
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,289
I wondered if

579
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:08,559
it was like,

580
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:22,960
boo boo, demon

581
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,389
guda---

582
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:30,360
I wonder if there's a tendency to complain that there's no such thing as rags

583
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,290
.

584
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,160


585
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,570
Toyosu

586
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,020


587
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,360


588
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,860


589
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:56,460
Patiño Who was the facilitator for a long time

590
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,429
?

591
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:03,779


592
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,909


593
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:06,899
3 I

594
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:09,420
wonder if it's good or not

595
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,630
aa There's a study group channel

596
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,530


597
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,090


598
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,210


599
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,090


600
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,310
.

601
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,840


602
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,620
