1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,170
I feel like I got

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:03,880


3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,730
9 for the first time since the UK, US and Tokyo started

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,650
, but that's why I'm talking about rejection, isn't it

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,519


6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,550
?

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,500


8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,050


9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,880
I know it's too much of a mistake, but

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,640
security is far away, so

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,380
Mr. Zoro came

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,279


13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,640
to see me

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040


15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,410
.  I talked about a lot of things in the talk,

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,770
but this year

17
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,059
it's going to be the second

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,070


19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,210


20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,510


21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,740
installment.

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,040
We talked about it, but in the 100 years that I've talked to you, the one that

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,270


24
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,360
left the best

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,330
impression on me was a combination of good love and things like that,

26
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,600
but machine learning, huh?

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,070


28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,409


29
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,040
After all, we've made quite a bit of progress in just one year, and there are

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,740
various couplings, various sets,

31
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,020
and things like that that have been commercialized.

32
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,010


33
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,650


34
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,210
Well, it's

35
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,320
good that it's getting a close-up

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,520


37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,490
, is

38
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,520
n't

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,060
it

40
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,250
?  I have something to say, but I have data,

41
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,820
but how about that? I'm following up from the space

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,240


43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,240


44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,950


45
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,068
.  Well,

46
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,380


47
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,050
I don't know if it will be more than one of the clarifications of this movie black box,

48
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,569
but we just announced our

49
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,550
research results in a little black

50
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,260
hat advertisement.

51
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,110
What we tried with our approach is

52
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:29,390
that the 8 humans and Emer live on earth, so we assume that there will be some sort of bias, so of

53
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,459


54
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,950


55
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,519
course there is that bias, and humans learn like this

56
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,819
ao

57
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,920
knots.  It's like a data set

58
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,459
that allows  It's a word that

59
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,840
has to be used with a little more care,

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,209
but

61
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,329
I think there's a little bit

62
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,760
of bias in the world where there's gravity, such as tomorrow, when humans create

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,749
things

64
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:57,450
.  Kanbei's

65
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,409
research

66
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,069
question has already become a research question, and what

67
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,400
is the

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,470
by and number

69
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,290


70
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,120


71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,930


72
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,010


73
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,500


74
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,080
?  I actually went to the

75
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,049
country where I thought it was spread, and it

76
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,580
was the result of buying it,

77
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,099
but I think it's just a black box,

78
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:26,440
and it's the second position.

79
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,250
I think I'm thinking about it a little, isn't

80
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,310


81
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,700
it? Certainly, I should say that, the

82
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,480
owner was listening to the story just now, and

83
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,970
he stepped forward with Char's seat, but

84
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,269
he's caught in gravity, isn't he

85
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,890


86
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,800
?  That's why

87
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,200
I've been interested in human beings recently, and there

88
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,110
are quite a lot of things that happen unconsciously

89
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,990


90
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,070


91
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,610


92
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,850


93
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,080
.  Or maybe

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,730
there are things that you don't understand even if you're conscious of it,

95
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,740


96
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,350
so maybe there's no such thing as normal words and actions.

97
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,910


98
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,490


99
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,180


100
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,640
If it is left in the

101
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,100


102
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,830
log as the activity

103
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,260


104
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,040
of the  If that dog and its companions have bad things, then it's

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,810
probably a dog and a frisbee or a stick, isn't

106
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,210


107
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,840


108
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,660


109
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,040


110
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,770
it?

111
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,210
This kind of bias called round sand is the most

112
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,190
meaningful.It's like a cluster league of husband's pairs of Peko's dictionary.

113
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,110


114
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,210


115
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,430


116
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,240


117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,250


118
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,730
I didn't see that, but

119
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,400
I was able to increase the rate of false positives

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,260


121
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,560


122
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,540
.

123
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,550


124
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,620


125
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,930
There is a possibility of misdetection, but in

126
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,880


127
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,180
this way, that

128
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,300
kind of bias of human beings

129
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,580


130
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,680
is propagated through the school.  I

131
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,020
thought it was just one example of something like

132
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,289
that, but I don't think

133
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,380
Mark was

134
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,810
analyzing

135
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,300


136
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,880


137
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,450
Postale either.  That's

138
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,940
why it's something that's born in the same image

139
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,780


140
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,900


141
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,060


142
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,150


143
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,210


144
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,479
.

145
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,930
I think it's another unseen case of a pair of professionals who recognize that a dog and this stick are bent,

146
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,870
or a cat's Frisbee

147
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,629


148
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:19,320
.

149
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,900


150
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,550
After all

151
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,390
, it's a form that can make a

152
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,770


153
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,200


154
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,180


155
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,900


156
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,560
great misjudgment.

157
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,500
It's the

158
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,990
shape, or rather, in the first place,

159
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,370
the dog and the round object,

160
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,669
the unconsciousness of the data

161
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:54,449
, I'm young, but the dog and the round object are

162
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,570
not the dog and the round object, but the dog.

163
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,849


164
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,860


165
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,449
Is it something that humans do?

166
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,089


167
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:08,979


168
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:11,150


169
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,940
On the other hand, there's a stop sign above,

170
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,249


171
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:19,080


172
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,900


173
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,139
so I'm going to eat after all

174
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,139
.

175
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,530
In

176
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,150


177
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,789
short,

178
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,340
it's a black box that I can't see.

179
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,400
As a way to let the deer enter the net,

180
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,550
I dared to prepare a clear and easy-to-understand example

181
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,440
.

182
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,470


183
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,410


184
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,900
When

185
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,610
on earth

186
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,009


187
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,110


188
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,700


189
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,780


190
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,210
you're bound by 16?

191
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,690


192
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,080
So it

193
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,690
may be correct, but it's certain. The dog flying in the air to me

194
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,090
has a soft face

195
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,680


196
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,200
.

197
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,230


198
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,930
If it's a Naga, then if the data that feeds that cat

199
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,320


200
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,290
is based on, for example, a dog, then the dog makes a

201
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,789
ufo-like sound next to

202
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,820


203
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,559
it.

204
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,750
If you keep on saying things like that, you wo

205
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,330
n't be able

206
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,310
to make

207
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,150


208
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,720
misjudgments.

209
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,540


210
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,129
There is a possibility that the accuracy of the correct part of the

211
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:58,529


212
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,769
lens has

213
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,509
dropped a little.

214
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,350


215
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,930


216
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,590
However, I think that one of the black

217
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,810
parts is part of the story

218
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,090
, but it's not the only

219
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,780
one, but it feels like you can understand one of the personality traits,

220
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,930
especially the latter.  We're going to be the

221
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,000
target, and it's about time

222
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,150
for Yorote Shirakata to analyze the boundaries between them

223
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,700


224
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,440


225
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,710
.  But

226
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,000


227
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,470


228
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,010


229
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,260
if you look at it from the other side, it means that it's difficult to connect it to something just

230
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,620


231
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,570
by memorizing it by itself with an image like a round object, for example.

232
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,240
I ca

233
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,580
n't get it,

234
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,040
and I can't help but rely on something like a dog and a round thing like a frisbee.

235
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,810


236
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,640


237
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,870


238
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,420


239
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,220


240
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,319
Well, I think it depends on how you perceive

241
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:17,130
it, but it's true, but that's why it's

242
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,080
a

243
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,270
black box when it comes to commuting to school.

244
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,150


245
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,210
And if it's a dog, it's just a dog,

246
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,570
so I gave it data that doesn't reflect many other things, and I

247
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,240
call

248
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,290


249
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,720
it

250
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,329
prosperity ability, or it's a traditional dish.

251
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:42,550


252
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,200
Even if

253
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,769
you come, it looks like you're saying "dog"

254
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,150
No, yes, but

255
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,000
that's difficult, so it seems that there's also a dog + By the way

256
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,530
, that relationship is reinforced.

257
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,980


258
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,500
If

259
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,870


260
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,460
you don't make that kind of judgment, it's difficult to make that kind of judgment, so that

261
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,379


262
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,869


263
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:16,300
's how it's

264
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,760


265
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,710
done.  Hey, it's a bit big, really, there's a bit of a loss there, and it's

266
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,490


267
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,520


268
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,530
a bit of a

269
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,560
satie black box, and it's

270
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,900
just that the latte research is red

271
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,760


272
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,070
.

273
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,020


274
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,380


275
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,140
That learning, well, for example, right

276
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,080
now

277
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,870
, the engine that tries to make various judgments by swallowing that image

278
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,200
is based on a lot of things like machine learning, and

279
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,420
it's done with a lot of nets

280
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,740
, and it's like the relationship by Necker, isn't it?

281
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,770


282
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,960


283
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,530
No

284
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,880
, it's true, it's true, it's

285
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,650
6 o'clock

286
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,290
, and I'm bound by gravity, but there's

287
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,200
a bias that makes me think of things that are likely to be on the ground.

288
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,750


289
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,150
It's

290
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,590
like saying that there's a bias.

291
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,100


292
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,870


293
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,830


294
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,800


295
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,160
Wow, you

296
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,940
said that I was a dog when I was an astronaut at the beginning

297
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,730


298
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,339


299
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:06,800


300
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,660
.

301
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,889


302
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,180


303
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,360
I don't know if I can say it, but it's interesting

304
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,070


305
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,590
But in the end, it's kind of

306
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,990
like a black box, and it's a

307
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,060
four-size black box-like

308
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,640
way of unraveling it, isn't it?

309
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,940


310
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,270


311
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,900
Really, the Distinguished Service person thinks that human biases are

312
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,660


313
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,250
surely in the first half of AI, too,

314
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,210
so what

315
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,800
kind of biases

316
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,200
do humans have

317
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,940
?  I think

318
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,410
there's something going on, so is that a good idea

319
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,420
? Actually, it's

320
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,100
a form of going to the district together, so it's

321
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,279
interesting.

322
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,170


323
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,600


324
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,250


325
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,200
Interestingly, this is the most interesting thing,

326
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,690
and it seems that it's a

327
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,270
class that's hard to think of, and

328
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,460
it's a fortune-telling person,

329
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,170


330
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,950
so that's the way it is.

331
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,930
Hey, even if it's nothing, I can't get out of school soon I

332
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,790


333
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,860
guess it's a collective story about us humans

334
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,750
This is a Frisbee that had a dog and a round thing

335
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,670
Even if I say it, I'm tempted to say

336
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,870
Yes

337
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,450
No

338
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,450
Rather, on the contrary, in

339
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,150
terms of data debugging, it may be necessary to

340
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,390


341
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,370
think about how outlandish things can be, such as whether you can get

342
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,200
your

343
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,260
period.

344
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,089
It's definitely true that you're the one who creates the data. Physical strength is important

345
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,250


346
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,660
even for children

347
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,570


348
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,459


349
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,730


350
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,499
.

351
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:10,829


352
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,489
I wonder if something childish is dead.

353
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:16,200


354
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,280


355
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,210


356
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,310


357
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,500


358
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,110


359
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,769


360
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:33,860
However, if that's the case, then on the contrary, the sound dammer de backer

361
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,230
mainly exposes such biases, or rather,

362
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,790
it

363
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,130
's exactly what you've done now.

364
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,370


365
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,320


366
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,440


367
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,420


368
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,700


369
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,660
After all, there are many schools,

370
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,020
so it's good to have a way of life that produces results that don't depend too much, is

371
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,000
n't it

372
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,550
?  In the end, it's

373
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,100


374
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,399
not a question of bias luck,

375
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,339
but it worked a little more mathematically, but it

376
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,199
seems to be quite a lot,

377
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,579
so

378
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:17,649


379
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,059
what is the correct answer?

380
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:21,970
I'm still thinking about it, but I've already done a lot of things, and I'm thinking that

381
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,899


382
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,310
I'd like to try to restore it in one way of reducing it by continuing to analyze the black box

383
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,779


384
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,660
.

385
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,400
I think you said the same thing last year for two minutes, but it's

386
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,209
the fart Wanger, isn't it? The

387
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:41,100
central computer,

388
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,259
or the Nezu method, is

389
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:46,320
quite suggestive, or rather,

390
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,160
three different sounds.

391
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,190


392
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,889
That's the

393
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,529


394
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:00,430


395
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,550


396
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,959


397
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,059


398
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:12,109
final answer.  The first is

399
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,230
that when you're fed something really outlandish, you hit it, and

400
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,510
there's an engine that opens up the idea of ​​eugenics

401
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,390
, and whether or not that engine's cooperation is a majority decision,

402
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,669


403
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,079


404
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,839
but maybe it's necessary to determine the final result based on that,

405
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,000
so this is today.  I've never seen a harbor before, so I

406
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,950
'll study it a little.

407
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,950


408
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,550


409
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,530


410
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,700


411
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,279
That's why it's like a judgment, so in the

412
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:49,000
end, if that's what you want, isn't it

413
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,570
interesting?

414
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,970


415
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,649


416
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,519


417
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,610


418
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,830


419
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,590


420
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,679
Talking about fake news,

421
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,799
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh yeah, technology is really popular right

422
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,769


423
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,350


424
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,820


425
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,800
now.  I

426
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,950
can't see it from things  I'm

427
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,659


428
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:30,460
thinking of doing a bit of research on things like extracting

429
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,169


430
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:35,889
things like fun things, for example, things like fun and eccentric things

431
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:38,570


432
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,179


433
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,460
.  Well,

434
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,590
if you collect a lot of Japanese, I think you can derive it from

435
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,690
various

436
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,600
things such as the origin or the tendency of the expression

437
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,550


438
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,900
, but it's a

439
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,120


440
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,210
little more interesting to dig out various things now.

441
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,960
I thought something might be coming out, but you

442
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,070


443
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,039
can see the compounded fake news that was announced this year, but

444
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,430


445
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,680
I'm still at a safe distance with government bonds, but

446
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,340


447
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,909
what is it?

448
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,330


449
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,390
We are taking the same approach as that teacher,

450
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,169
but people who use fakes in their self-introductions.

451
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:27,390


452
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,700


453
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,770


454
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,530


455
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,230
Everyone, please know that the

456
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,430


457
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,530


458
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,540


459
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,150


460
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,490
characters are you.

461
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,890


462
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,260
People who introduce themselves often use words that have nothing to do with peace, and I

463
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,910


464
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,040
can see a tendency to use fake words.

465
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,020


466
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,680


467
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,220


468
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,360


469
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,309


470
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:08,100
Well, there are some things that are vague and can't be put into words well

471
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,400
, but after

472
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,980
all, it's painful that people who fake have some kind of characteristic,

473
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,110
right

474
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,350


475
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,470


476
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,210
?  It's a good thing to be a human being.

477
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,370


478
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,700


479
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,760


480
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,910


481
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,160


482
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,470


483
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,480
That

484
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,299
individual comes out, but even if you're not conscious of it, you're still human, and that's why you have a

485
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,570


486
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,029


487
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:48,039
desire to show

488
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,649


489
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,029


490
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,179
yourself off.

491
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:56,859


492
00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:00,700
Um, the cherry blossoms are here  Especially on the Internet,

493
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,099


494
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,379
I think that this is a case of more pronounced division, but yes, it's

495
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:08,190


496
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,590
like, after all, you should be careful when using the Internet.

497
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,840


498
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,140


499
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,559


500
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,789
I

501
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:23,429
think it's not like it used to be like it used

502
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:27,659
to be, but on the contrary, it's

503
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:31,559
becoming that way, and because of that, I've come to see a lot of things.

504
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,110


505
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,680
I think that there is, and

506
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,740
what

507
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,930
you say is also about whether there are many specific words or not, and

508
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,300
I feel like I can read that quality, and

509
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,010
we humans ourselves.

510
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,290


511
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,060
When you read it,

512
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,860
you somehow feel

513
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,230
like you're trying to be pretentious, and if you can put it into words,

514
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,900


515
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,770
think of it as a story that can be modeled.

516
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,940


517
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,840


518
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,600
Judging whether or not someone is close

519
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,650


520
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,920
to you is a good idea, isn't it

521
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,840


522
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,290


523
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,620


524
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,080


525
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
?  Then I want to go to the evacuation center and sleep on the right side of the car

526
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,130


527
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,690


528
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,860
.

529
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,750


530
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,510


531
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,660


532
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,220
I feel like I might be able to pick it up, and

533
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,240
after

534
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,169
all, the recent Japanese

535
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:44,620
head Japanese is

536
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,440
quite good,

537
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,500
so things like Alboreze are appearing, so

538
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,020
2 is that gcd 2 grams in Ochanomizudai and

539
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,080
Aso.  If you use the higher part,

540
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,810
I think it will be quite different, so even if it

541
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,200
's difficult Japanese, it's not as difficult as

542
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,880
English

543
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,919


544
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:09,649
.

545
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:12,230
Even if I say I'm waiting,

546
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,850
it's just a navel with a data set,

547
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,660


548
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,260


549
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,480


550
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,740


551
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,080
is

552
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,429
n't it?  On the

553
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:27,039
contrary, if there is an opinion that the assertion is easy to understand

554
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,230


555
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,000
After all, there are opinions that there aren't many castle halls

556
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,070
, right?

557
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,050
Twitter is being used in a strange way, is

558
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,050
n't it?

559
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,789


560
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,649


561
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:45,720


562
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,999
There's a lot of dusting, etc. There's a lot of it, isn't it

563
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:51,229


564
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,059


565
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:55,670


566
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,840


567
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,480
?  Shiki Nihon Fact Check

568
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,340
I forgot the name of the first one, but I

569
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,230
think it would be different if I proceeded and talked about the information listed there.

570
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,539


571
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:11,389


572
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:12,919


573
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:15,820


574
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,389
I don't know what's going on here,

575
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,039
but

576
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,950
I think it's completely

577
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,789
subjective

578
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:28,080
.

579
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,809
But what about

580
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:32,700


581
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,690
the question of whether or not we can successfully reduce that bias, or things

582
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,289


583
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:41,760


584
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,940


585
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,040


586
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,500


587
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,290
that contain biases?  Thinking about things like improving the performance in terms of form,

588
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,460


589
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,950
implementation, mechanisms

590
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,800
, and planning intentions for the model itself, I feel like I

591
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,620


592
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,290
can't find a way to improve the accuracy even a little.

593
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,680
Even though

594
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,830
humans are manipulating things and collecting data, I

595
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,220
thought that it would have been impossible if I had been completely irrelevant if I had been involved even a little

596
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,549
and the data itself was created by humans.

597
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,700


598
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,340


599
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,050
It's a leg that has a

600
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:29,180
bias in it That's right, isn't it?

601
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,780


602
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,470


603
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,710


604
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,850


605
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,669
I think that's the way it

606
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,980
's managed in general,

607
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,510
or is it

608
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:54,180
about 30 minutes after zazen is set up to win the game?

609
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,390


610
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,850


611
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,320


612
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,540


613
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,049


614
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:06,419
Well, let's go up the Ose for a while  My

615
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,299
daughter-in-law's love of pornography and I

616
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,370
had a math class, so it seems that there was a story that

617
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,940


618
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,559
it became very popular

619
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,909
.

620
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:21,549


621
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:23,460


622
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,540
If

623
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,300
I didn't do it, I would run wild with a little voice in the av and work,

624
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,370
but

625
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,980
that's why I'm sure that people are calm.

626
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,540


627
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,900


628
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,860
It's true,

629
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,540
there's something about it, and the

630
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,870
judgment at that time and the judgment at the time when it's

631
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,390
not, may be different, isn't it

632
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,960


633
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,700


634
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,320


635
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,809
?  It's the mother of the government,

636
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:03,149


637
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:04,710
and if it's even money, you should buy a data set when it's cold

638
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,830


639
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,240


640
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,960


641
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,030
.  It's

642
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,460


643
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,130
possible, isn't it? The

644
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,960
good truck that Mr. Mod said might still be good.In

645
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,640


646
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,390
terms of the ship, it might come in

647
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,820
8th

648
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,730
place.I can go get at least Ig Nobel.

649
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,240
People

650
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,840
with low bias

651
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,389
appear in sage time

652
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:41,279


653
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,630


654
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,030


655
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,230


656
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,460


657
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,590
to make good desserts.  It's

658
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,350
impossible to reduce the influence of

659
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,029
that

660
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:57,389


661
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:00,820


662
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,850


663
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,260
bias to zero.  Yes,

664
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,370
pink is also like

665
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,180


666
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,010


667
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,490


668
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,520


669
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,179


670
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:21,230


671
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,320
that after all.The effects of going back overseas and shaking them in Japan are a little different, aren't they?  I think we can

672
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,600
also see that kind of propagation that the cherry blossoms have entered Japan,

673
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,070
so after

674
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,010
all the cherry blossoms ended up flaking at the

675
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,840
meeting.The Japanese media reported that they entered Japan

676
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,630


677
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,899
.  I

678
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:40,119
think it's very interesting that there is a city dental association pip as an analysis target

679
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,409
.

680
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:43,670


681
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,650


682
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,040


683
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,250
It seems like it's getting more and more influence in Japan around

684
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,010


685
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,330


686
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,030


687
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,710
here.

688
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,399
It's like

689
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:10,100
a tsunami warning.

690
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,340


691
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,520


692
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,330


693
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,670


694
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,940


695
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,810


696
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,720
Well, it's kind of like an unfulfilled dream,

697
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,560
but

698
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,330
I want to do something

699
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,040


700
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,220


701
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,340
like

702
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,940


703
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,740
that.  It really

704
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,540


705
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,210
feels like there's a wave coming

706
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,640
from Murashita.

707
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,980


708
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,140


709
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,840


710
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,940
If it's the birthplace,

711
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,640
the information will come quite early, and

712
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,190


713
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,230


714
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,100
so on.

715
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,530
In

716
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,340


717
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,919
a world like INTAGE, there are quite

718
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,320
a few observations like

719
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,029
that, and

720
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:30,519
what is it?

721
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,749


722
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:33,909


723
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:35,919


724
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,729


725
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,960


726
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,850
There was also a fleet that

727
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,850


728
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,470


729
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,740
propagated the uploaded sauce, was

730
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,290


731
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,490
n't there?

732
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,309
I don't think it's true,

733
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:59,760
but it's fake Information spreads

734
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,580
pretty quickly, doesn't it?

735
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,930


736
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,030


737
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,220


738
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,370
It has power,

739
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,070
but the pink one spreads with about the same momentum.

740
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,130


741
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,520


742
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,870


743
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,390


744
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,220
It's like saying, "Why don't we start by doing

745
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,950
something?"  That's what I'm thinking f That's right, the

746
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,380


747
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,860
naive or tree guy crawls like this once with a pad,

748
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,260
and it's fake, and

749
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,120
I want to go up

750
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,620


751
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,070


752
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,500
again.  I think it would be interesting to try it,

753
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,350
but in the

754
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,309
end, it's also a human being in the middle,

755
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:56,150


756
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,090
isn't it

757
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,830
?  I think it will come out.

758
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,040
That's something interesting and rewarding, but

759
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,960


760
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,870
I also feel that it's quite difficult to deal with.

761
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,240


762
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,049


763
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:16,110


764
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,879
It means that it is possible to identify things

765
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:20,340
like fake posa, so that's what Horiike says to prevent it by systematizing it

766
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,690


767
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,179


768
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:25,470
.

769
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,860


770
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,500
I wonder if it's because I don't have to understand

771
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,830
that there's this kind of spread that makes it unique, and

772
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,940
I wonder if it's possible that it's

773
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,920
possible to detect it and that characteristic

774
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,390


775
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:45,480
fades away.

776
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,030
However, I feel

777
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,250
that people are the theme of color 6 e.

778
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,960


779
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,060


780
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,440


781
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,360


782
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,030


783
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,370
Well, since it's me, I think that fake things

784
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,410
are really interesting because

785
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,830


786
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,060
people's behavior seems to change a little by letting out various information.

787
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,850


788
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,340


789
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,550
Recently, the papers in the book say that this is

790
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,760
okay, but after all, I instinctively think

791
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,700
that there is probably an effect itself

792
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,420
, but

793
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,840
while doing

794
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,970
that, there is a certain amount of impact on human behavior.  It

795
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,960


796
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,020
's

797
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,120
not about controlling behavior, but about

798
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,970
visualizing the effects, I'm interested in it all at once,

799
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,059
isn't

800
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,790
it?  maybe  Ah, it's

801
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,000
about time for

802
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,179
behavior and interest to

803
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:00,179


804
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,450
change when you put out information that successfully stimulates them, doesn't it?

805
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,019


806
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,329


807
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:11,399


808
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,290
Roughly speaking, I think it's a medical way of thinking

809
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,550
, but I don't know what to say, but

810
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,610
that way of

811
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,520
thinking is all about that

812
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,650
data, and it's not verified in terms of data.

813
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,690


814
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,080
However, there are quite a

815
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,800
few ways of thinking, well, the way of thinking that is being used is a good kind of information manipulation

816
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,679


817
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,040
, and it

818
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,360
feels good to change it.

819
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,440


820
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,440


821
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,710
If there is something that

822
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,620
doesn't happen, I want to

823
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,609
join, right?

824
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:00,489


825
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:03,160


826
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,770
To put it simply,

827
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,400


828
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,369
when certain information is leaked, it's impact, or

829
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:12,540
it's like the power of transmission,

830
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,890
what does that

831
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,180


832
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,040


833
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,810


834
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,810
mean?  If you don't get tired, or

835
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,330
if you love your little sister,

836
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,070


837
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,250


838
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,130
it would be like this, wouldn't

839
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,330
it?  Well,

840
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,970
what is it? Complexity and fun are not there.

841
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,240


842
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,490


843

[Music]

851
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,630
Non-fiction is fine,

852
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,230
but it's

853
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,390


854
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,910


855
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,810


856
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,610


857
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,850
sober.

858
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,500
I'm just

859
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,780
expressing the real hedge of how to receive it,

860
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,950
but I'm talking about someone

861
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,320
who plays against it, and it's

862
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,350
dramatic, and it's an

863
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,780
element that attracts

864
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,580
people.  It's good

865
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,180
news that it sells like this

866
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,309
I'm interested in my mother,

867
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:41,950
so I'm going to say that, so

868
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,320
if it's a combination of that child, it's dramatic.

869
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,140


870
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,570


871

873
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,760
end, Nakamura also puts people in

874
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,580
a lot of trouble.

875
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,190


876
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,460


877
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,180
We have quite

878
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,799
a few

879
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,540
systems, and we wanted to create various systems

880
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,250
and provide services,

881
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,450
well, as an engineer, but in the

882
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,500
end, we'll get them to use them well.

In order to gain the patronage of Ha,

884
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:30,990
I think it's human psychology,

885
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,010


886
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,950
and I think I've thought a lot about how it's reflected in the qualifications and what kind of tendencies there are.

887
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,770


888
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,630


889
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,030
I'm quite interested in

890
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,700
things like design and the psychology that forms the basis of design.

891
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,430


892
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,800


893
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,650


894
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,220


895
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,860
There's a way of thinking like the advanced economy, and that

896
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,510
kind of thing has become really interesting, and from there, it seems like we can do a lot of things

897
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,600
with Aso, which is a little cheaper

898
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,279


899
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,270


900
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,860


901
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,940


902
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,829
.

903
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:30,150


904
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,270
That's what

905
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,079


906
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,480
I mean, so I'm going to try and organize the information again

907
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,940
in some way, so I feel like I'm hunting.

908
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,670


909
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,580


910
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,030
I

911
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,400
think it's true that papers from academic societies are also

912
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,859


913
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,660
input into human factors, and I

914
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,869
feel like they're going to come out from now on.

915
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,069


916
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:01,349


917
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:05,999


918
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:09,239


919
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:11,249


920
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,889
I also know that I can

921
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:15,740


922
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,460


923
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,080
see things like mechanisms, systems,

924
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080


925
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,240
and software that are easier for humans to use.

926
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,000
as a service and

927
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,770
create content, so

928
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,120
in order to maximize the purpose and intention of that content  I think that this kind of research and

929
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,000
the results of that research can be used after all, and it

930
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,690


931
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,060
's kind of interesting

932
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,760


933
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,300


934
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,569
.

935
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:53,729
That's right, there are still a lot of

936
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:58,049
things like that, from the point of view of learning,

937
00:39:58,049 --> 00:40:00,160


938
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,200


939
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,010


940
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:13,000
Aiki.  This is the situation in which learning progresses the most,

941
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,670
isn't it?

942
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,579


943
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:21,210


944
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,970


945
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,850


946
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:29,900


947
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,970
It's hard to raise this to 10.5 unless you look at it and do things like that

948
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,830


949
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,860
, but I have an ambition to make it a little more visible

950
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,770


951
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,490


952
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,660
.

953
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,109


954
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:51,180
Well, at least I'd like to create something

955
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,930
that the professional can use as a reference for the

956
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,930
data that comes out of that system.

957
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,330


958
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,370
Well,

959
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,300
it

960
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,210
was a good year, so I thought that my learning

961
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,339
efficiency would be very high, so I had

962
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:13,050
such expectations.

963
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,440


964
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,710


965
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:25,200
Go ahead, this is 10 years old, it's

966
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,530
beautiful, so I'm talking about

967
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,200
radio waves and fairs,

968
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,160
so I'm doing a lot of things right now

969
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,530


970
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:38,930
.

971
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,030


972
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,190
I'm watching Max Headroom

973
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,800
There was an incident,

974
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,420
this was really

975
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,860
fun, but it's fun, but it's a

976
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,930
radio wave jack, isn't it?

977
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,400


978
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,530


979
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,940


980
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,810
That's right, in

981
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,050
Chiba, sayaka's mother is abundant

982
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,640


983
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,950


984
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,900


985
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,310


986
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,050


987
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:14,520
.  Well, in the end

988
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,970
, it's definitely a lackluster attack, isn't it? Well, the current car and the

989
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,760
rural entrance to this place, but it's like

990
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,980


991
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,490
Hisashi oot and sa.

992
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,710


993
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,280
I've talked about it, and I

994
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,410


995
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,660
wonder if it's an area that we need to take some

996
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,330


997
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,910


998
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,590


999
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:47,370
countermeasures for in the future.  In the

1000
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:50,010


1001
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,120
end, we came to

1002
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,220
a point where there was no intention of illegal use, but

1003
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,270
I think

1004
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,670
there is probably a way to win the grand prize with today's technology,

1005
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,220


1006
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,250
and I want to make it a virtual research theme  That's

1007
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,190
right,

1008
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:12,150
something like gps In the end, it's incomplete in

1009
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,089
a sense, so much information, including authentication information.

1010
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:17,069


1011
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:19,800


1012
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,950


1013
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,829


1014
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:27,599


1015
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,710
U Tanaka

1016
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,930
thought it was a great idea, so I thought it was a great idea, such as looking at various

1017
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,330
things such as whether it is running

1018
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,420


1019
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,030
or it is coming from a satellite, and so on.  I

1020
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:45,280
don't think it's possible to detect and eliminate something that uses a lot of radio jacks, but it's

1021
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,700


1022
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,200
only for

1023
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,950


1024
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,740


1025
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,220


1026
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,539


1027
00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:17,930


1028
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:21,109


1029
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:25,000
usa pro.  I think Wada already
