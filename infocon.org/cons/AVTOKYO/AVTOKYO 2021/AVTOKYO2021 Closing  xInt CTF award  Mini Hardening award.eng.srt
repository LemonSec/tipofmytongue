1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,030
That's the closing ending

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,200


3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,370
Let's go to the mistress 2D

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,809


5
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,910


6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110


7
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,130


8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,160


9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,350


10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,840
Who are you  But since then

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,360
, Kyotaro-san has been around for a week Kentaro-san,

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,580
everyone does

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,130


14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,590


15
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,110
n't know what happened to him.

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,710
I don't like it, but when I was a sister, I had a lot of sex in the morning

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,870


18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,579


19
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,440
.

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,059


21
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,910


22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,670


23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,490


24
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,869
I

25
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:15,640


26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,909
wonder what this 24-hour television officer

27
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:20,800
did in about six hours

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,090


29
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,010

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,380

54
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,020


55
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,770


56
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,760


57
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,320
Well,

58
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,660
you know, Mr. Takada, I

59
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,070

60
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,180
'm a little out of control.

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,849


62
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,370


63
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,430
Yes, if you come by the end of the day, then I'll use my

64
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,970
research instincts

65
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,980


66
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,040


67
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,549


68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,900
.  I'm begging you please release the nipples 3 It's

69
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,250


70
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,130
not today,

71
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,170
it's not, it's not the wind, it's about

72
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,290


73
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,050
time Yes, I'm sorry, but yes, it's

74
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,080
frozen.

75
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,390


76
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,850


77
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,790
I want to share

78
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,170


79
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,608
my

80
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:19,029


81
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,620


82
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,320


83
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,780


84
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,300
screen.I wonder if I can share my screen

85
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,100
.

86
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,610


87
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,810
Souvenirs will come true I

88
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,010
wonder if I should look up at the time

89
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,760
Everyone drank too much,

90
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,560


91
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,009


92
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,599


93
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,710


94
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,590


95
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,000
didn't they?

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,730
I'm going to ask you to share your screen once Sea

97
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,940
san,

98
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,460
there was no reaction

99
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,480
Number of

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,630
nits tf Every year, an interesting question comes up,

101
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,600
and if you don't mind it, Chongqing has about 20 questions, is

102
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,550
n't it?

103
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,740
There are only about 4 more questions,

104
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,770
but Potosi seems to

105
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,770
have been doing well

106
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,780


107
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,470


108
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,040


109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,530
.  It doesn't seem like there's a

110
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,210
lot of it, so

111
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,660
touch it,

112
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,190
Mr. Jun, who should stop by

113
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,130
the Otsu side?

114
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,620


115
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,419
It's a phrase that has stopped

116
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,190


117
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,490


118
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:14,409
responding Ah, it's gone.

119
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:17,789


120
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,009


121
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,020


122
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,470


123
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,500


124
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,170


125
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,210
55. I read a

126
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,170


127
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,310


128
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,620
little bit about the takedown people this time

129
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,100
and talked about it, so 80% of the

130
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,560
people who were stabbed were well stabbed.

131
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,689


132
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,350
It's been a while since there's

133
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,180
saas, so

134
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,740
it's like, let's raise the industry and take it down together.

135
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,100


136
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,550


137
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,610


138
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,280
If it

139
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,230
's hard, there are hardships like those people's hardships,

140
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,340
so if you ask people who are there, they

141
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,050


142
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,360


143
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,150
're people who are doing bedding measures.

144
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,370


145
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,210


146
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,379


147
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:33,060


148
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,460
There's no such thing as

149
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,490


150
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,130
something you can get,

151
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,440
right?

152
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:46,300


153
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,710
Issa ga low

154
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,340
Hey, hey, look,

155
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,740
10 big families,

156
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,229
like naming them

157
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:57,270
Natsu

158
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,990
Spoon

159
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,449
[laughter] If

160
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,009
it's not a summer prize,

161
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,319
Jeanne

162
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,889
2

163
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,949
I'm jealous, and we're all people who are doing it now  It's a fence group that does it for

164
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,479
free, so

165
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,289


166
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,520


167
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,020
I listened to the story, and

168
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,889
it felt like I was grateful

169
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,189


170
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,590


171
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,210
.  Sometimes I became a calligrapher,

172
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,880
but it's online, so it's like this,

173
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
but when it's fried, I

174
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,929
find it in real time and take it down.

175
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,289


176
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,880
I feel like I'm going to have a good time today, so I'm going to

177
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,460
book it at night

178
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,650


179
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,769


180
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:53,390


181
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,940


182
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,440


183
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,530
