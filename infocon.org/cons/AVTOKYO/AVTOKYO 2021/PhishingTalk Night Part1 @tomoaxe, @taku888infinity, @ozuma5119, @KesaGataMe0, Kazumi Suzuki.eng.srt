1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
I'd like to move on to 2, and I'll talk about

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,970
phishing later this time.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,890


4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,960


5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,969


6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,160
I would

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,289
like to finish talking about

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,020


9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,230


10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,039
the patients I want to

11
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,039
have.

12
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,260
I'm going to go there, so

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,109
please forgive me. Now then

14
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:49,820
, I would like to start by introducing myself

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,309


16
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:53,590


17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,510
.

18
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,310
But

19
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,650
you may have seen him.

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,510
Self-proclaimed as a phishing scam hunter, he's a

21
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,910
handsome guy desperately trying to scammers.

22
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,550


23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,320


24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960


25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,670
I'm abolishing it even though I'm thinking about it, but

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,570
somehow

27
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,200
I don't feel like I'm in this sort

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,790


29
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,700
of thing.

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,640
I'm working in a team that collects

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,890
things.

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,710


33
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,210


34
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,869


35
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,670


36
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,650


37
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,380
I've been holding symposiums and parks in various places, and

38
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,180
recently I've been a guest

39
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,159
member of the teacher selection committee Puko during the security of IPA

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,560


41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,320
.  It's a person who uses 200 pairs of Kota and has

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,450
not responded

43
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,619


44
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,320


45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,060


46
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,060


47
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,400
.

48
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,250


49
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,940


50
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,590


51
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,599


52
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,860
I'm 8 Nakamura, and I'm doing it on Twitter called

53
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,560


54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,500
8 and

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,250
max.  I've been working in my current tribe since December, and I've been

56
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,610
working on the theme - initially, web

57
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,350
diagnostics, etc.

58
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,360
I've been doing things like diagnosing smartphone apps and doing things like

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,460
security, but

60
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,510


61
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,390
since 2017 I've been asked to do phishing countermeasures, so I

62
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,610


63
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,239
've been doing things like Colonel Fish and user enlightenment Tatsuo

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,970
.

65
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,099


66
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,200
I think I'll be able to introduce

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,720


68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,049


69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,660
myself

70
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,650
at the right

71
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,830


72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,270
time Thank you.

73
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,640


74
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,520
I'm using this

75
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,180
icon on

76
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,760


77
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,640


78
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,110
Twitter and so on.  So, after that, I know that imitation of threat

79
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,829


80
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,879
intelligence is still at the level of imitation.

81
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,159


82
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,739


83
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,739


84
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,340
It's a pity it's a pity that it's a top pin,

85
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,390


86
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,890
but yes, I have a 3rd grade, but I'm

87
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,640
studying to get a

88
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,630


89
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,440


90
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,110
4th grade.  It's just that I'm at home, so it's just like this

91
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,750
Well, it's not for the people who come here

92
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,910


93
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,430


94
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,610


95
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,610
.  It's the

96
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,380
end of

97
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,140
the lap, thank you.

98
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,000


99
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,829


100
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,629


101
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,020


102
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,740
By the way, the

103
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,330
name "Kesatame Alert" was born,

104
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,930
but I'm the person who sends out that message.

105
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,710


106
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,000


107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,919


108
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,860
Using this account,

109
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,259
they find

110
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,539
and transmit information about

111
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:55,300


112
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,449
phishing sites.

113
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,060
As the joy of the company,

114
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,400
that slate interior  Regence,

115

incident response

116
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,170
, countermeasures related

117
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,310


118
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,380


119
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,260
to phishing

120
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,720
, and

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,560
so on.

122
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,440


123
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,289
Well, I have a bit of a strange background

124
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,349
. Tourism is the so-

125
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:37,319
called edge of this development.

126
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,949


127
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,600


128
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,060
Well, from there,

129
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,680


130
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
I moved to protest against the IT company Map Audition Technology Company, and

131
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,750
I work

132
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,700
in security there.  But in the end, it

133
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,210
's too much to do with this mobile phone communication,

134
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,180


135
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,669
isn't

136
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:04,070


137
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,410


138
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,590


139
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,200
it?  It's better to communicate with

140
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,140
Peace 3 Singles, I'm the

141
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,330
most my Bain screen.

142
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,600


143
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,130


144
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,130


145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,570


146
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,040
I'd be happy if you could

147
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,060
, ah, it's on the 4th floor. It

148
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,370
's the one for security

149
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,520


150
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,950


151
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,350


152
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,160


153
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,289


154
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,389
.  This is the end of the self-

155
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:56,360
introduction time

156
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,479


157
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,180


158
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,159


159
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:06,619
.

160
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,869
please a fishing scam

161
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:11,310
What kind of scams are there now? Everyone

162
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,680
mainly talks about the organization against the tactics and uses email sms

163
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,290
to direct them to the store's homepage and

164
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,090


165
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,180
try to steal account information id password and personal information.  One of the tricks

166
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,580
is what kind of things are there

167
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,340
? Is it a stone site, an online mail order

168
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,320
site or an

169
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,750


170
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,039
auction site?  There have been

171
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,069
a lot of cases where people talk about things

172
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,680
like web services that are really familiar to people who live on the line, and what

173
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,530
's

174
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,900
trending at the time.

175
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,509


176
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,340


177
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,540


178
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,270
It is in the form of phishing scams and other things like that.

179
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,550
Phishing scams are increasing in what form

180
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,050
.

181
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,210


182
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,650
I have received it, so it's already spring,

183
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,870
but for example, the 10 major threats of ipa's coordination

184
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,970
are already threats for individuals

185
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,040


186
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,350
, so they are becoming one of the threats that we always have to

187
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,760
be very careful about.

188
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,680
Also, this is my report on phishing countermeasure discussions,

189
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,970
but this is also on the

190
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,520


191
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,160


192
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,110


193
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,140
rise.  It's not whiskey that I

194
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,750
'm passionate about, but Beecher and ec's children too, are

195
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,180
n't they

196
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,920


197
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,479


198
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,519
?  Yes, I know, and

199
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,899
I want to think about it.

200
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,779
Yes

201
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,360
, it's about phishing sites.

202
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,698


203
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:44,500


204
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,360


205
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,529


206
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,829
Actually, there's a waterfall

207
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:54,069
phishing site is hidden.

208
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:55,240


209
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,649


210
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:00,350


211
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,629


212
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,910
Among them, there may be one thing that you think is right, but let

213
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,410


214
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,279
's put that aside and say, "

215
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,920
This is

216
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,050


217
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,999
it."  While I

218
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,820


219
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,310
'm eating chocolate,

220
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,380


221
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,260
this is delicious.

222
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,420


223
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,279


224
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:49,600


225
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,950


226
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,160
Actually, it's only here  People who think

227
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,440
it's strange that something is being kept alive are

228
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,330


229
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,130


230
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,620
already said to be active as

231
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,230
one of

232
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,670
the phishing scam hunters.  It's a site

233
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,070
url martial law, but

234
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,120
basically Yahoo keeps it except for the domain of evidence,

235
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,889
isn't it?

236
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,080


237
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,840


238
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,650


239
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,720
If that's the case, I wonder if this is the one that's

240
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,780
taken away from

241

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,170
isn't it?

246
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,660


247
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,680


248
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,160


249
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,100
I don't even

250
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,320


251
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440


252
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,330
know about that security thing.

253
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,330


254
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,920
Sometimes it's not there, so even if you're in a real company, you can't see

255
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,279
through it, so I'm

256
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,550


257
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,130


258
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,870
the author.  For

259
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,580
those of you who have been listening to the

260
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,560
scam hunter story, you may say this again,

261
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,020
but let me

262
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,850
say

263
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,010
this again.  3.

264
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,260
We're saying that we shouldn't try to separate

265
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,330
things, but it

266
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,510
's the opinion of all of us that we don't try to tell them

267
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,610


268
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,190


269
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,470
apart.  This

270
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,840


271
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,660
is a story of

272
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,240
pattern 1. Pattern 1. This is

273
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,610
a book of stern assets

274
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,890
.

275
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,509
I ca

276
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,910
n't tell at all if this is the only difference.

277
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,129


278
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:05,499


279
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:09,249


280
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:11,499
On the b Shingu site, the real thing and the fake one

281
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,589
are covered, but this is also good,

282
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:17,510
isn't it

283
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,400


284
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,410
?  After that,

285
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,810


286
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,330
there are cases where it is attached in this way, so there are cases where the users who actually come

287
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,190
have misunderstood that this is the real thing,

288
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,440


289
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,240
so first of all, stop making judgments just because you have already been told.

290
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,730


291
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,500
After that, I often say this too,

292
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,170
but the

293
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,470
judgment is based on the difference between whether

294
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,720
to return a ctp or not.

295
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,730


296
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,459
90% of the 8 out of 100% have been converted to s

297
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:52,399
.

298
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,290


299
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,689


300
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:00,089
The

301
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:02,250
browsers that are using

302
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,019
hps may not be successful, so please think that the

303
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,300
phishing wallet fake site has also become s.

304
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,519


305
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,680


306
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,500


307
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,399
It's a matter of judging the domain

308
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,920
.

309
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,770


310
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,529


311
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:26,230


312
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,140


313
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,910
Even if you put it on jp, it's a phishing age or

314
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,399
it will be completed normally

315
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,970


316
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,769


317
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,260
.

318
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,570


319
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,970


320
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,389


321
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:48,040
So

322
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,019
please don't think about it, so what

323
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:52,329
is the

324
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:55,029
basic countermeasure?  I want you to put it on today, and

325
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:58,389
the company I belong to

326
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,269
often sends real emails like this to users,

327
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:03,680


328
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,040
but I've already said that even real beer should be suspicious.

329
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,080


330
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,060
yes yes  Please don't access the so-called so-called "Please don't access

331
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,150

333
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,680


334
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,050


335
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,820

337
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,240
, please try to access

338
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,550
it.

341
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,930


342
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,779
I don't receive a single millimeter of royalties,

343
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,970
but please do so

344
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,910


345
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,090
.

346
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,800
I don't have this

347
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,230
part-time finance, but I'd

348
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,300


349
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,300
like to talk about whether there was a phishing scam that caught your interest,

350
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,890
but I'd like to

351
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,900
put about three big

352
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,310
ones on the

353
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,320
first one.

354
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,080
Recently,

355
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,990
there are a lot of strange things about

356
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,800


357
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,360


358
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,430


359
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,990


360
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,320
swordsmen.  This is something that's

361
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,880
happening, isn't it increasing? Or rather, I go there occasionally.

362
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240


363
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,830


364
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,709


365
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:40,100


366
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,279
My savior is

367
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,290


368
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,500
Yoshikaki of Ti. I'm sorry, but

369
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,950
when I saw this, I felt a kind of nostalgia

370
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,089


371
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:58,389


372
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,100
.

373
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,459


374
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:07,480
I don't realize it, but when I write John-kata, the pronunciation is information

375
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,680
.

376
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,809


377
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,749


378
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:15,560


379
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,829


380
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:22,820
I think it's something that remained even when I copied and pasted it on my body

381
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,180


382
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,579


383
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,269


384
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,670


385
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,110


386
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,170
.  If you're Japanese, you won't notice it.

387
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,300


388
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,720
There are

389
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,360


390
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,510
quite a few full-

391
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,370


392
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,950
textbooks with phonetic syllabaries like this [music] pops and sounds

393
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,630


394
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,120
.

395
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,339
Well, basically, it's

396
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,520
phishing when you look at the email, but

397
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,119
it's something like a comedy in the stomach, 10 seconds

398
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,640


399
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640


400
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,579
.

401
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,770


402
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,920
So I can see the Nakao seiki, but I want you to stop doing this,

403
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,359
right?

404
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,459


405
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:30,490


406
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,000


407
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,870


408
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,420
Mr. Kesagatame-san's 2 races This is

409
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,100
Jalan's recruiting guy, isn't it?

410
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,830


411
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,710


412
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,820


413
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,320


414
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,360


415
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,840
It's interesting,

416
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,520
fishing,

417
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,850
I want to do some kind of battle, of

418
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,080
course

419
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,450


420
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,780


421
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,790


422
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,910


423
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,720
.

424
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,300
On the

425
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,390
left side, it's a

426
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,430
test of the

427
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,670
Self-Defense Force's large-

428
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,360


429
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,659
scale center.  Hey, the

430
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:55,250


431
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,520
one on the right is a passive

432
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,080


433
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,650
dfe from that one ip. All the comfort women are one ip.

434
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,320


435
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,570


436
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,610


437
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,559
This is amazing,

438
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,409


439
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:18,770


440
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,840
if you look at the left side of Hakoshima, it's like you're throwing out a bunch of faces, or rather, it's suspicious if this much is sent to a single heart-pounding email right now, is

441
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,330


442
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,510


443
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,030
n't it

444
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,980
?  It's kind of like sending a person or

445
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,510


446
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,140


447
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,270
something, but it's become popular, isn't

448
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,980


449
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,440
it?

450
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,480


451
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,360


452
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,480
Emails with the same content arrive at the same blog many times a day,

453
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,630
so if you do something like this,

454
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,250
you'll notice that there was an attacker

455
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,540


456
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,940


457
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,690
.

458
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,550
Also,

459
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,890
Condy Sagiko: If I can acquire it with just one IP, I

460
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,380
feel like I

461
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,110
dropped it in Tosu, and

462
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,690
I feel like it's impossible to drop the URL, right?

463
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,000


464
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,960


465
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,330


466
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,330


467
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,590
There's been something interesting recently about the

468
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,669


469
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:34,200


470
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,929
meandering mass-produced system.

471
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:40,690


472
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,190
I don't know

473
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:47,799
1 In the first place

474
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,929
, I don't drive a car, so I don't

475
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,379


476
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,150


477
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,610


478
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,740


479
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,250
know.  Well, from the point

480
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,980
of view of the story, it's

481
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,270


482
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,150
okay if there's no sense of incongruity with

483
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,170
the credit card

484
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,420


485
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,679
.

486
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,120
From the point of view, there is a good connection there,

487
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,900
or if you are focused on your car,

488
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,720
it doesn't necessarily mean that you are strong, or

489
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,180
something like that.

490
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,320


491
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,590
If you give

492
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,539
me a card

493
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,970


494
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,830


495
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,749
, unlike my family, I don't always have it

496
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:48,989
close to me.  I

497
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:49,979
've forgotten a little about its existence,

498
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:51,840
isn't it

499
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,690
boiled down?

500
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,660


501
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,390


502
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,640

In rousing 3, it says that payment method is

505
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,830

506
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,000


507
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,039
edc is disabled, stone lane is

508
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,499
the starting point of control by 9. Please update the payment method,

509
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:18,289
so don't worry.  You

510
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:21,470
've done a good job of saying that you're in a car.

511
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,809
If I don't update it here, the next

512
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,179
time I get on, the bar won't open,

513
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,679
and I feel impatient and I'm going

515
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:37,380


516
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,170
to input it.  It's a story, well, it

517
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,660
's a story about a cat's story and a little

518
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,530
strange story, but I've been with me for about half a year this year,

519
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,830


520
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,200
but it's okay, until now I have

521
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,659
ID, password,

522
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:55,480
credit card information, bank account

526
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,890
think it's personal information, so I put a picture of my driver's license and uploaded a picture, and I feel

527
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,700


528
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,470

What is it?

539
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,960


540
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,669
I feel like there's been an increase in the number of people like that since around the time I was shot, but

541
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:38,649
it's because everyone's attitude towards uploading the world has become

542
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,149
relatively high and

543
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:42,700
they've come to do it normally

544
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,119
.  It's a little scary to put it in

545
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:49,020


546
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,879
. You're right. Yeah, yeah,

547
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,630
we only have 5 minutes left at home. It's

548
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,110
small.

549
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,020


550
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,230
One more

551
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,179
thing in a year I'm a

552
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,010
bit desperate about this phishing scam I've been

553
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,010
looking at this

554
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,070
recently and I really like it, but it's

555
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,940
police Keima - in

556
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,630
the form of twitter distribution  Shiro I really like it.

557
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,550


558
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:30,330


559
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,010


560
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,500


561
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,220


562
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,860


563
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,260


564
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,170
However, we have also changed this within our company.

565
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,230


566
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,720


567
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,120


568
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,380
But

569
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,540
pictograms were

570
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,720
popular around the Olympics, so Kei used them.

571
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,970
It's been said that they've sent it out, and it's also become a hot topic on

572
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,460
twitter, the sound of these ja-year students,

573
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,880


574
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,380
but I

575
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,540
'm looking at the Hyogo Prefectural Police's website version.

576
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,810
I was

577
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,940


578
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,920
thinking that I would like to include the fishing destination here,

579
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,040
but in the end, Wechat does the work Well, there are some

580
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,880
technically difficult parts, especially the part that prevents it from entering, after

581
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,180
all

582
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,130
I know  It's a very important part

583
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,890


584
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,960


585
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,500
of getting a bed.

586
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,620


587
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,320


588
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,000


589
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,250
For example, I

590
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,620
want

591
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,460
the government to do a good job, not just the wounds, but also the government, and the

592
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,470
organization and clothes are nice.

593
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,960


594
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,090
There was something in the

595
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,000
past, and now Mr. Hayashi is involved in this composition.It

596
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,279
seems that around 2014,

597
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:07,940
the

598
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,970
Mitsubishi blooms fa Ritsukoku almost fills the screen.

599
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,080


600
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,200


601
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,740


602
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,980
Well, I don't think so, but that's all. Cars, well, it

603
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,650
certainly feels like it's going to draw attention.

604
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,830


605
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,780


606
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,720


607
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,230


608
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,580
Hmmm, silver song pack, I'm at Akihiko's window, and I want you

609
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,680
to put it in a tissue

610
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,479
[music]

611
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,900
I want you to run boo-boo

612
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,460
[music]

613
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,220
Patty's

614
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,669
only 3-tick chassis

615
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:06,340
Kanyoku So yeah, that's how it is

616
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,130
Live is good  It's a live show, so it

617
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,610
's been a long time since it's been a long time, and

618
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,429
it feels like there's a land reclamation

619
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:17,580


620
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,630


621
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,330
.

622
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,020


623
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,880
It's

624
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,430
Noboru-san, and he's very disappointing, so it feels like he's devoted

625
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:34,200
himself to sashimi toppings just to keep that taste as much as possible

626
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,260


627
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,730
.

628
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,950
Eiki 90% was good.

629
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,320


630
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,029
It's like pulling it out

631
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:50,509
Well, it's a well-defined word,

632
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,140
and it was a big hit.

633
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,440


634
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,170


635
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,720


636
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,730


637
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:07,169


638
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:11,549
I'm not ready for the next time at a certain point,

639
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:15,330
but would you like to go

640
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,659


641
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,310


642
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,770


643
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,950
ahead with this?

644
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,810


645
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,170


646
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,180
Maybe it's because of

647
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,460
shoulder pain, isn't

648
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,310


649
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,730


650
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,400
it?

651
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,710
It's okay, it's bad,

652
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,389
but

653
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:14,659
now it's

654
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:17,419
more than popular with

655
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:20,149
Cartwright. Thank you for listening. Well,

656
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:22,940
I'll see you later

657
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,149
.

658
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:29,149
It's time, so everyone, let

659
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:31,729


660
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:35,810
's go to the sacculus.

661
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,950
