1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,220
Okay, so

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,130
yes, it's

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,950
a machine learning talk, so after this machine learning, we'll be

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,310
doing a lot more

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,790
events or workshops

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,710


7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,650
, so the

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,350
main cast is Akira Kuroko and

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,890


10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,180


11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,290
Arai.  You know, those two

12
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,630
are in charge of that part 1 part like it's normal

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,530
?

14
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,420


15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,210


16
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,460


17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,910


18
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,490


19
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,160
Well, it starts at 5:00 a.m. The

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,100
first half of the hour will be a work shock

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,480
from me.

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,140


23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,610


24
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,000


25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,400


26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,370


27
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,090
It's fine to say that it's going to take three years of

28
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,160


29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,820


30
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,690


31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,250


32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,330
hardships.  The time tax is from me, well, it's the basic

33
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,520


34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,750
Hanzo who doesn't know machine learning

35
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:41,149


36
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:42,220


37
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,000


38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,970
.

39
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,820
The essence is

40
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,890
extracted,

41
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,030
so you can use it as it

42
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,000


43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,840
is.

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,229
Ah ah then

45
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,630
there hasn't been a single person in Japan who has gotten it

46
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,640


47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,380


48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,320


49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,160
yet, right?

50
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,230
On the desk, there's something like Kikel.

51
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,620


52
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,830


53
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,240


54
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,240


55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,320


56
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,189


57
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,310


58
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,819


59
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,159
I was in charge of Chapter 9,

60
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,840
Patty, and I was

61
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:09,849


62
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,069


63
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,830


64
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,380


65
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,190
in charge of the Prime Minister, who provided security for the handshake system and the algorithm

66
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,470
itself.  How did you write it in the first place

67
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,660
?

68
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,120
I'm going to show you

69
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,080
the contents of

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,260
the book while showing you the contents of the book, which will be released on November 5th

71
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,740


72
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,080


73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
, while using the winter editing

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,550
coat.  Thank you,

75
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,800
Ars.

76
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,760
Recently, I had the impression that you've been dealing with quite a lot in research, and

77
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,350
I feel like you

78
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,900


79
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,829


80
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,709


81
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,450
're big.  It's been a long time since

82
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,019
I've been in the middle of a long

83
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,299


84
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,609


85
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,760


86
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,660


87
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,790
time

88
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,358
.  Yes, in that case, if

89
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,709
you read the volcanoes that have been properly incorporated,

90
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,630
let's say it's a mound

91
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,680


92
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,720


93
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,830
.

94
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,800


95
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,080
I've been referring to other articles about launching to learn, and I've been using them quite a bit

96
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,630


97
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,780


98
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,970


99
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,820
, but when I think about it, I don't think there's anything that can be said to be just a

100
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,510
bunch of employees.

101
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,940
I don't think there's much to say about books that have been translated from overseas, but rather than

102
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,760
the latest

103
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,790
topics, there are a lot of topics from just a little while ago, don't

104
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,620


105
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,169


106
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,650
you think?  I

107
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,629
'm not the one who flies, but there are more

108
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:11,400
things like

109
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,860


110
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,820


111
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,580
this

112
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,320
.

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,060
That's what it feels like Yes, there's a

114
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,050
boob

115
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,659
Nyoron What the hell is this story about 50%

116
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:46,210


117
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,590


118
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,480


119
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,510
?  A mother who has 7 people has come.

120
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,049
Kuroyone-kun also read it, and she said, "

121
00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:01,289


122
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,589
Why don't you bring 7 people to Mr. Bouba to respect

123
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:21,319
him?"

124
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,289
7

125
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:28,520
was also properly supported, and it

126
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,680
was a small amount of time, but it was a large size.  Anyway, the

127
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,759
contents of

128
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,740
Amazon's review studies

129
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,009


130
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,169
Shake your eyebrows.

131
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:43,639


132
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,409


133
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,929


134
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,780


135
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,910


136
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,090


137
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,970
I want to work on something new, but I'm going to

138
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,639
learn words and

139
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,860
apply it to the

140
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,599


141
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,800


142
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,690


143
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,930


144
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,350


145
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,170


146
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,070


147
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,569
security field.  Hmm

148
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,939
Expected learning If you use it like this, security will be useful, is

149
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,009
n't it?

150
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,750


151
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,969


152
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:34,459


153
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:38,169


154
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,560


155
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,220


156
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,710
I immediately thought that machine learning security would definitely

157
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,620
be good in the future, but the stakes and benefits are weak, or rather, it's bad.

158
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,720


159
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,930


160
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,040


161
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,550
For example, I thought that it would be better to

162
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,370
be organized and become stronger If you

163
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,889


164
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,479
google it and search it, you'll find a

165
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,240
data set of mostly irises, but

166
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,930
the sound of love is a bridge between the length of the ward and the face.

167
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,090
Well, that's fine, but it's a realization that the

168
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,090


169
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,239


170
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,850
world is not good for security that is about to

171
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,560


172
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,280
be breached.

173
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,830


174
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,150


175
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,650


176
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,549
When did you buy the decrease in the items

177
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:42,130


178
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,000


179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,010


180
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,650
you

181
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,240


182
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,649
did this time?  I'm going to publish it, but ah, this is the original book, and there's an impressive

183
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,200
phenomenon. It's not a tariff

184
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
.

185
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,730


186
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,050


187
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,830


188
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,670


189
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,350
It's close to the original,

190
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,140
especially the ones that have been dyed black three times.

191
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,939


192
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:22,259


193
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,779


194
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,249
The

195
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:28,859
uneasy

196
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,159
pocking is completely switched during the fiper parameter

197
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,970


198
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,350


199
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,690
.

200
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,130


201
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,720


202
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,180


203
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,570
I see,

204
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,610


205
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,399
no,

206
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,980
but the purpose of this ad is not bad,

207
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,890
or rather, it conveys the essence of Japanese mini-character learning, which has a good effect on people,

208
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,670
but doesn't know about machine learning.

209
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,680


210
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,930
The gist of it was good, but when I read about it, I found that even people who have a good

211
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,839


212
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,620
understanding of it seem

213
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,240


214
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,980


215
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,050
to have omitted some of the

216
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,270
vague parts.  That's the same for high power meter

217
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,490
tuning, and also for

218
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,110
attacks on the cache system

219
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,420
.

220
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,370


221
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,620


222
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,930


223
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,889
Is the best

224
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,579
to Nagane, and after that, it's about time, and

225
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:47,209
the 45 environment has changed, right?

226
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:48,060


227
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,610


228
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,400


229
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,310


230
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,540
I want to have it built and see what's inside

231
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,140
.

232
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,270


233
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,620


234
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,690


235
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,550


236
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,990
There's a lot of progress management

237
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,560


238
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,300
, and it's quite a lot

239
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,000


240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,370


241
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,779


242
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:43,810
.  Propo and Pro

243
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,200
+ broke through.

244
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,600
I see

245
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,200
I had to put in updates most of the

246
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,780


247
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,690
time

248
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,490
.  You know,

249
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,630
that's

250
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,600
why I think it's limited to short-term travel

251
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,089
, but I'm afraid we can't quite do

252
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,700
that.

253
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,710


254
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,030


255
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,550
It's true,

256
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,730
but there's something really

257
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,440
wrong around here.

258
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,480


259
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,670


260
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,960


261
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,640


262
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,490


263
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,480


264
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,600
It's going to be a music game,

265
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,120
but the library api changed in the middle of the day

266
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,279


267
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,569


268
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:42,850


269
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,569


270
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:45,339


271
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,250
.  It

272
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,949


273
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:51,800


274
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,750


275
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,320


276
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,820


277
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,899
seems that the version of the library that depends on it seems to be different between the google collaboration version and the profitable version,

278
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,180
especially the update of the machine learning library.

279
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,190
So, the difference is that it's

280
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,190
quite difficult to collect it in the midst of a lot of

281
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,460


282
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,200


283
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,420


284
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,010


285
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,460
trouble.

286
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,779


287
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:27,999
There's

288
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:30,999
something like

289
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:31,750


290
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,649
Chapter 4 and

291
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,149


292
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,610
Boss.  It's

293
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,710
normal,

294
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,510


295
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,329
I can't help it, but I think it can't be helped

296
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,680
.

297
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,359


298
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,210


299
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,910


300
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,490
It worked in the windows xp era

301
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,920
, but in reality, with 7 or later,

302
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,699


303
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,379
various mitigations

304
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:14,460
are included and it doesn't work.

305
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,060


306
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,930


307
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,690
It's strange to some extent

308
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,970
, and I think about platforms like OS

309
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,940
for malware analysis,

310
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,640
or a library of passenger cars for 100 types of security now,

311
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,900
and I wonder if the

312
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,940
expiration date is about a light

313
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,900


314
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,320


315
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,340
year.

316
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,860
You know, even if you follow up on the site, there are

317
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,320
still limits, and the content

318
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,280


319
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,190
itself often becomes quite outdated.

320
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,370
I thought there was some significance in running the

321
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,029


322
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,209


323
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:01,610


324
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,059
whole distance, so I threw my tail behind other

325
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:07,819
companies.  There are some things about how to use such tools

326
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:10,009
that will inevitably become obsolete,

327
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:10,899
but

328
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:13,670


329
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,449
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I

330
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,910
can't do that, so I'm definitely standing and cosplaying

331
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,560


332
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,870
It would be nice if you could say that properly

333
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,350


334
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,520
Unexpectedly, my wife's tool is Garnetz, so I

335
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,350
saased it, but it's

336
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,170
okay to cut it off now, but it's a

337
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,460
lot of

338
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,480
trouble.

339
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,410


340
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,750


341
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm handing out a

342
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,779
flower, and I think it's going to move, and I'm going to make a

343
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,320
model reservation, thinking that it's a feeling of fullness

344
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,340


345
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,640


346
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,280


347
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,410
.  To a certain extent, it's

348
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,490
true if you talk about dependence, but after

349
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,269
all,

350
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:05,550
from the point of view of satisfaction, if you can win the probability of receiving an email from the

351
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,230
editorial branch school

352
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,920


353
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,390
After all, since you

354
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,520
bought it, you want it to work properly.

355
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,290


356
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,230
I'm spending a lot of money to buy it,

357
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,170
so it's going to be 5, so I think even if I say it, it's

358
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,500
because the expiration date is approaching, and the town

359
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,019
is in a good

360
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:32,470
mood.

361
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,750
Is

362
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,460


363
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,850
it because I'm in my 80s at the supermarket

364
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,890


365
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,720


366
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,000


367
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,950


368
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,470


369
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,710


370
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,210


371
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,270


372
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,250
?  It's true that the

373
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,280


374
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,709
people who call it line programming

375
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:16,520
don't come out with programs that are compatible with Pro 3. Oh,

376
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,619


377
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,609


378
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,339
that

379
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,500
's right.  Great Japan python

380
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,630
amazon This is also a business trip frenzy I

381
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,090
can only move with python 2

382
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,179
Grabbing and opening Arthur

383
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:39,889
Yajiu It's big but it's

384
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:44,179
okay to go straight to the warriors 2 wins 3 losses After that

385
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:46,720
Hmm

386
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,580
It's okay if people who read it convert

387
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:48,880
it.

388
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,159
[Laughter]

389
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:54,820
Oh, yeah,

390
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,679
they say that music is that important.

391
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,220


392
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,409


393
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:03,950


394
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,970
It's quite different depending on whether or not

395
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,490
it's a new report for students, but the Air Force just got in,

396
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,320


397
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,960
but it seems like there's been a trend since around 2015.

398
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,220


399
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,289
It's not something like

400
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:19,720
that, but I don't get drunk, it's a

401
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,230
beater,

402
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,010
so I guess something close to the trend in Japanese has

403
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,770
to be firmly organized.

404
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,470


405
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,410


406
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,330
I think I'll do

407
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,330
it, but it's

408
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,460
hard work, but I'm going to make it

409
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,730
, so I can read it in Japanese, especially when I'm young

410
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,429


411
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:47,919
.

412
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,250
In Tokachi, a high school student,

413
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,720
I read the Wizard Bible all the time,

414
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,350
and when Arthur

415
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,160
loved

416
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,929
it, I thought that it would be easy for young people to touch it, and suddenly,

417
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:02,010
for example, a

418
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,390
unique security paper, four maids would

419
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,460
[ __ ].  When it comes down to it, I'm a

420
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,590
full-time employee and my mother is a cook hard, so

421
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,040
I'm running the difference.

422
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,800


423
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,670


424
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,940


425
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,870


426
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,510
It's like how to write and read like this, it's

427
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,080
like a

428
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,570
sport You have to know

429
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,450


430
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,679


431
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:33,570


432
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,530


433
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,560


434
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,290
the rules  It's about time

435
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,250


436
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,500


437
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,390
Christophe cure, come on,

438
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,010
Sakata Kaiya, there's such a thing, isn't

439
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,110
it?

440
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,040


441
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,250


442
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,269


443
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:02,609
I was locked up in a hotel because of a crime or something

444
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:05,129


445
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:07,889


446
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:08,549
like that.

447
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:09,649


448
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:12,290


449
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,340


450
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,809
Because it comes out

451
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:21,809
like that  It's on the

452
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:24,600
2nd floor of the

453
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,700


454
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,360


455
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,450


456
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,290


457
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,330


458
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,120
musical instrument.  What is the selling point

459
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,050
?

460
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,770
Eh, the

461
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,030
first half of 8 is for beginners, and the lakeside is Mr. Kuroyone.

462
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,520


463
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,410


464
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,690


465
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,650


466
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,540


467
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,430


468
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,880
I don't know what it is, but I didn't know that the

469
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,930


470
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,030
people might not die

471
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,100


472
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,580
out. I'm probably

473
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,980


474
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,059
a beginner.  There

475
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:19,540
seems to be a Ross-type black box.

476
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,110


477
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,890


478
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,860


479
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,080


480
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,419


481
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:34,460


482
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,140
I have to do a little bit, but I

483
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,490
'm 13.

484
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,550
Well, if it gets a good reputation, I wonder if there

485
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,559
will be another development.

486
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,970


487
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,460


488
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,550


489
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,460
Well, this is the tone that has an

490
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,549
event.I wonder if everyone will feel like it's a favorite

491
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,239


492
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,420
.

493
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,480


494
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,910


495
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,020


496
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,360


497
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,120


498
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,710
It seems that the number of people reading books has increased thanks to the coronavirus,

499
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,440
but I think it's 4. Yes, the Wii computer

500
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,210
security programming

501
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,890


502
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,309
came out unexpectedly.

503
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,860
After all, I'm not doing that 2nd term,

504
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,289
so it's like self-study time for that amount, isn't it

505
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:37,669


506
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:39,520


507
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,169


508
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:47,420


509
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,960
?  The situation has changed, so

510
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,830


511
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,320
I might be busy with the revival of some things in the second season,

512
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,900
but if

513
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,880
you could bring a book to accompany me to

514
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,550
work or school, I'd like to

515
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,520
study

516
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,150
.  and

517
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,550
myojo  But

518
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,140
hahahahahahahahahahaha

519
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,500
I wonder if it's okay or something like that Okay, okay, well, it's

520
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,720
early, but let's finish it with

521
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,690
this.

522
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,000


523
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,100


524
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,860


525
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,919
Please move over there. Yes, so Mr. Gon,

526
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,640
Mr. Arai

527
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,800
will have a workshop after

528
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,550


529
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,960


530
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,600


531
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,959
this.
