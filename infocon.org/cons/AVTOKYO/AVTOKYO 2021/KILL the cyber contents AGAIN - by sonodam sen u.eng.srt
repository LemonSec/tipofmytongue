17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,530

10 years of eating oysters

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,300
There was a serialization, but

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,300
I've been talking mainly about the

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,650


23
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,020
story of this series.

24
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,460


25
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,750
In the latter half of this

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,090


27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,520
, I thought I'd try to deal with

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,610
recent data for both of

29
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,479


30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,340
them.

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,230
I've seen quite a lot of them, and there's a

32
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:25,180
trending Articles of Incorporation judge behind

33
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,290

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,710


35
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,970
them.

36
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,310


37
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,090
I've already done about 44

38
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,000


39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,300
tests, and

40
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,040
there are so

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,520
many.  Around the same time as Bouba, that

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,300
guy called Anonymous got dirty.

43
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,940


44
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,640


45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,369


46
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,650
It's the main

47
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,770
feeling, but hacking is also included

48
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,440

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,650


52
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,190
?  But that's

53
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,790
why other Pokka companies supervised

54
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,950

58
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,800
things like this, too

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,629
.  or Mr. Luck

60
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,310
Well, it's already been worked out, isn't it?

61
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,830


62
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,980

67
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,800
It's hard for a hacker to be the main character, isn't it?

68
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,620


69
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,510

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,850


73
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,810
There's that

74
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,440
kind of slave

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,020
I'd like to see a

76
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,980


77
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,970


78
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,280
bit of it, but umm, well, the hacker's expression in that video It's a story in the first half, but it's a bit difficult, isn't it

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,460


80
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,170


81
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,380
?  I haven't seen hackers at all,

82
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,569
but what

83
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,310
about the direction? The hacking scene

84
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,920
is, after all, something like that new interface that's a

85
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,310
little

86
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,540
cg-like, and there's always something like that of a

87
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,890


88
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,200
laptop computer.  I'm going to do something about people who are just showing off

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,909


90
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:08,110


91
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,860


92
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,720


93
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,410


94
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,140


95
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,740
.  Well, at that time, hey,

96
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,140
well, that scene where the Falcon flies,

97
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,090
here, I've made a lot of

98
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,870


99
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,650
silly hacks with

100
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,180


101
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,729
that guy.

102
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,550
The editor of the web company wrote

103
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,699
an article about hardships behind the scenes in the scans he was doing, did

104
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,230
n't he?

105
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,270


106
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,479


107
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,740


108
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,639


109
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,000
I feel like I want to cherish each and every process, but I said that I would

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,830


111
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,930
show it in the express video that is

112
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,720
sold in the video.

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,840
It's fine, but I've been told that

114
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,020


115
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,080
it's a custom, but it's

116
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,569
very rare, but it's important.

117
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,119


118
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:36,029
No, it's just good again, isn't it? There's a

119
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:38,009
project on it,

120
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:41,009
so many names come up.

121
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,169


122
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,330


123
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,830


124
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,520


125
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,680


126
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,520
When you try to depict it in detail, in

127
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,520
terms of visual expression, that sense

128
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,719
of speed disappears even if you pass it through

129
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,689


130
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,449


131
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,500
.

132
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,640
Also,

133
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,110
why recently

134
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,990


135
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,510


136
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,330


137
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,330


138
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,969


139
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:29,979


140
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:31,139


141
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,430


142
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,980
?  It's

143
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,190
just a lecture about things

144
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,380


145
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,860


146
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,409


147
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,840
like Fear's length and so on.  But

148
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,180
that's the secret behind breaking this password

149
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,950


150
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,529


151
00:06:55,529 --> 00:07:00,840


152
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,620


153
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,330
.

154
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,630
Isn't it great when a music scene appears in a drama?

155
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,460


156
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,340


157
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,830


158
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,940


159
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,610


160
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,300


161
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,690
Only the scene at hand is according

162
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,160


163
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,280


164
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,550


165
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,640


166
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,120
to Proger.  I want it, but I want it to

167
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,770


168
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,650


169
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,320
sound

170
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,090
like it's being played properly

171
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,370
.

172
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,830


173
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,040
But, yeah, yeah,

174
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,950
yeah, I think it was before

175
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,409


176
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,400


177
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,530


178
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,980


179
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,190


180
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,300
.

181
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,409
to

182
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,119
high  If the king scene is

183
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:27,360
okay, it's the one that Rear Rack was

184
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,569
doing, right? Yes, that

185
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:33,179
cyber defense head supervised

186
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,169


187
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,230


188
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:40,390


189
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,309
it.

190
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,650
It's not that

191
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,220
kind of acting instruction that shows how the stand is

192
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,740
doing now, but there's an

193
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,380
article

194
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,270


195
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,540
saying that they did

196
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,570


197
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,329
something like that.  It feels like technical guidance,

198
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:05,270


199
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,190
but it seems that this area is about to be included. Yes, it's a relatively difficult place.

200
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,050


201
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,590


202
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,770
Security camps and

203
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,030
earning cones are often mentioned, but a

204
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,210
Conversely, I

205
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,450


206
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,930


207
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,810
wonder if we're the one who's doing it.

208
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,030
It's the flat

209
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,769


210
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:42,040


211
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,040
security that plays that role, but what is it?

212
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,810


213
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,160


214
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,399
I thought

215
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,220
it was a bit nice to have a bar that looked like something

216
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,459


217
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:02,160


218
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,820
you know.

219
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,090


220
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,769
Hmmm nup

221
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,439
If it wasn't for manga or movies,

222
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,999
we'd have to go beyond reality

223
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,410


224
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,170


225
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,060
.

226
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,639


227
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,360
Well, that

228
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,660
's good, Anz. It was just a panel

229
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,240
discussion

230
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,660


231
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,230


232
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,540


233
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,480
.

234
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,600
I'm doing art production, and I'm going to edit

235
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,630


236
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,420


237
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,760


238
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,690


239
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,519
it.

240
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,740
After all, the inclusion is like this video

241
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,410
It's a work, isn't it?

242
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,290


243
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,400


244
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,190


245
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,930


246
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,370


247
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,980


248
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,660


249
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,160


250
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,350
I think it's gradually permeating TV and other things

251
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,440


252
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,510


253
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,360


254
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,540
.

255
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,400
It

256
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,840
's already over,

257
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,660


258
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,160
isn't it

259
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,459


260
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,410


261
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,860
?  It's a very realistic

262
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,620
depiction, and well, it's the same for

263
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,050
children,

264
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,550


265
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,180
isn't it?

266
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,100


267
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,899
For example, there are actually a lot of people

268
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,259
like that, so it's green radish.

269
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:16,929


270
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:19,479


271
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:22,150


272
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,910


273
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,820
It's been about 10 years now, and I

274
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,520
've been running quite a bit, even though I

275
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,520
need physical strength.

276
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,570


277
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,700


278
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,990


279
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,600
I don't think it's because of the

280
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,459
influence

281
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:50,800
of Nimasu, but Ozawa does

282
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,260
n't care. Japanese dramas have a slightly lower production cost

283
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,540


284
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,870

287
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,700
's

288
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,600
like South Korea

289
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,930

South Korea Manga and movies are amazing now, are

293
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,960
n't

294
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,730
they? The same goes for music, is

295
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,870


296
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,640


297
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,290
n't it?

298
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,960
A little j on Netflix

299

Ariel's bell ringing key is good

308
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,750
've loved independence day since then.

309
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,360
I want

310

Connor Arthur, who picked up + or once with a pen on 4 Independence Day,

n't he?  I love that

314
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,860
, hmm Roland Emmerich Park

315
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,910
likes really big things The

316
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,700
1996 movie

317
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,590
I'm talking about Oh, there's a huge spaceship out there It

318
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,440
's kind of weird, isn't it?

319
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,650
For a moment without disappearing,

320
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,880


321
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,100

324
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:43,449
that's right, that's right, the president is a child who pretends to be a beautiful game of fighter planes, and it's the most amazing

325
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,879
thing.

326
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,549
It

327

329
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,589
's stressful to

330

say that I'm using a mac powerbook

332
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:00,129
5300. I think it's amazing binary compatibility

333
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:03,160


334
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,939


335
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:07,420
.  I don't know what kind of bribery I'm going to

336
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,700
do, but I don't know if it's working in such a place

337
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,460


338
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,790

342
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,480
You have to get close to each other and you have to communicate.It

343
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,700
's probably a relatively short-distance

344
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,610
communication or 6

345
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,420


346
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,270
short-distance communication protocols,

347
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,730
but I don't know

348
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,670
how the bluetooth is so

349
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,400
powerful.  I mean, even if we get close,

350
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,790
the contents of those communications and the

351
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,180
promises will be the same,

352
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,199
right?

353
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,910


354
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,760


355
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,900
Since the repair work of the

356
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,350
spacecraft was attached, it seems that the protocol is probably a school

357
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,540
milk.

358
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,029


359
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:18,710

362
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,960
Ah, I see. That's not vulnerable. It's

363
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,690
amazing, it's just infected with a

364
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,260


365
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,760


366
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,500


367
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,820


368
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,950


369
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,480


370
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,670
virus.

371
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,000
Please say it's not the real person.

372
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,720


373
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,430


374
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,950


375
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,020


376
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,760


377
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,550


378
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,510
It

379
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,790
was a good month for my sister, but I liked it and said it with momentum

380
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,869


381
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,270
.

382
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,459


383
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,270


384
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,970
There's a manga What? It's

385
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,060
unexpected, but it's a

386
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,110
change,

387
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,350
isn't it?

388
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,910


389
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,910


390
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,680


391
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,290
Well, I thought

392
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,240
you

393
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,010
didn't want to say "back" when you read it on purpose,

394
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,960
but if it's not your head, then you can't

395
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,630
do this.

396
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,240
In a strange case

397
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,450


398
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,850
, there might be a movie company list gold industry

399
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,590


400
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,260
.

401
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,539


402
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,210


403
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,059


404
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,980
You

405
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,200
can see it as a fever, you

406
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,310


407
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,169
know, it's like I'm indigestion, and I'm worried about it

408
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,330
again, and I

409
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,000


410
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,789


411
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,820
'm raped.

412
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,000
I thought I'd take a look at it

413
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,460


414
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,660


415
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,730
next time.

416
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,080


417
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,909


418
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:49,740


419
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,070
Cyber ​​Revenger is a

420
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,140
former 007, isn't he

421
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,410
? ap love Labor Union 7

422
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:01,730
Oh, I wonder if he'll play an active role in Aizu 007

423
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,910


424
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,830
.

425
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,370


426
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,960
Kana Sono is actually stalking

427
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,880
Internet stalking is quite

428
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,490


429
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,059
a subject that has been taken up

430
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,740


431
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,890


432
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,049


433
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,080
in various content such as movies from Fluke.  So, the internet

434
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,690
or something like that is used, isn't it?

435
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,850


436
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,220
I bought a related movie that will be posted on SNS later in a

437
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,470


438
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,310
qualitative sense, right?

439
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,720


440
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,170
The screen ends on the SNS of this guy, the

441
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,130


442
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,730
child who can't hit this look already I saw it on International Assistance

443
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,830
Day or if I was listening to it

444
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,200
I wanted it quite a lot I can only see it at that level Mr.

445
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,020
Adama, the secretary  And then there's the mystery solving

446
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,530
, and I think I'm a girl, and I'm a

447
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,190


448
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,650


449
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,530


450
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,420


451
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,590
good girl.  Well, outside of Hollywood, yeah, it

452
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,730
's up on Tuesday,

453
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,180


454
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:30,160
and the actor who plays the picture of the main

455
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,140
character

456
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,170


457
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,710
is Saatchi.  It's Ise,

458
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,350
and it feels like it's really representing the times

459
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,570
.

460
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,059


461
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:50,880


462
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,570


463
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,480
Properly zooming in, demonstrating

464
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,530
Toko-chan

465
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,350
Movie oh yeah It's true Zoom movie I ca

466
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,840
n't see it

467
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,330


468
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:07,930


469
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,330


470
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,529


471
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:16,210
I wrote

472
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,399


473
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,230
that you shouldn't use zoom for something like

474
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,780
that, even

475
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,400
Yurashi-chan.

476
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000


477
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,700
Let's go

478
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,720
year,

479
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,670
that kind of thing

480
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,280
like the Internet is already appearing in every movie and every drama

481
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,830
, isn't it

482
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,860


483
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,240


484
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,610


485
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,290
?  There are

486
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,460
quite a lot of people

487
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,919
who say that they are good at raw computers

488
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,740
or something like that.  I don't think there are people who

489
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,070


490
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,119


491
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,939
normally look up their SNSs normally among the people who normally stand up and operate in various ways, even as people who collect information

492
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:07,609


493
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:08,509
,

494
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:11,389
like the current police investigation.

495
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:14,890


496
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,020


497
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,330
Well, this is a long-running drama

498
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,450
called Criminal Minds in America, is

499
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,970
n't it empty of profiling?

500
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,520


501
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,559
It's a premise

502
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,690
that the person can

503
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,730
draw out as much information as possible from

504
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,440
various sources,

505
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,770
but there's

506
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,070
a Higashi-Ue field called My Stand, isn't it?

507
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,620


508
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,230


509
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,220


510
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,789
Even if you look at the shopper, you can see the antenna, but I think it's a little bit, but if you

511
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:53,119
call him a super hacker and say that he

512
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,369
can extract various information, you can

513
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:58,700
advance the story quickly

514
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,470
.  Amazing dere

515
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,299
Gesture kids Well then fur

516
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:10,539
Actually, what kind of intrusion does that kind of information come out

517
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,940


518
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,210


519
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,170


520
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,990
?  I

521
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,160
don't know who's information Is it an SNS style? No,

522
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,380
this village isn't armed with data

523
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,630


524
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,730


525
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,190


526
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,570
.

527
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,970
It's

528
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,970


529
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,929
hard to get confidence, but

530
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:48,840


531
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,890


532
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,770
it's hard to find information after that.

533
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:57,140
That kind of

534
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,970
information is nothing but a

535
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,960
hit, but recently

536
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,109
there are a lot of companies using that cloud type,

537
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:24,779
so when they break in through a pen test, they search for

538
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:26,159
something like google drive

539
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,649
.  It's easier to find it now

540
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:33,509
, but it's well done.

541
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:36,029


542
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:39,399


543
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:42,820


544
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,799
Isn't there one

545
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,889
?  It

546
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:49,430
's

547
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,030
summer, so I think it's convenient, so I can't

548
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,510
underestimate searching.

549
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,470


550
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,680


551
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,350
Once you're done with it, you'll be able to use the tool, which

552
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,789
means

553
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:11,029
that it's convenient, and it's equally useful for

554
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:12,019


555
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,340


556
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,129


557
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:17,960
everyone.

558
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,260
It's a

559
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,119
serge, and it

560
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,269
's one and another It

561
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:26,639
's an old drama, but I'd

562
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:27,629
like to

563
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:30,590
see

564
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,760


565
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,450


566
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,610
it  You know it's

567
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,710


568
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,190
a character from the office file Groove leg file x9 x

569
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,960
file meeting It's a spinoff

570
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,100


571
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,140


572
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,840


573
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,659


574
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:57,190


575
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,490
I don't think it's popular, so

576
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,920
it's like a home 4 f

577
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,840
I shouldn't have done that spin-off Oh,

578
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,000
no, it's a

579
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,539
door.

580
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,120


581
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,010


582
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,250


583
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,290
Heh, that's all

584
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,150
sorts of things that were useful in pulling out all sorts of information, so I

585
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:28,130
'm Investigator Mulder from my own point of view, I'm tired.

586
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,590


587
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,750


588
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,660


589
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,940
If you start to feel like Nishichae, it's

590
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,340
okay Sakura

591
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,440


592
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,090


593
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,900


594
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,550


595
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,990


596
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,879


597
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:54,549
That's a pinch, so the

598
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:55,929
simultaneous terrorist attacks

599
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:58,119
You say you're painting your eyes, right?

600
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,089


601
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:04,829


602
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,120


603
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,219


604
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,250
That's what you say,

605
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,890
it seems that there are some hacking elements in it

606
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,120
, right

607
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,700


608
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,730


609
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:33,640
?  Yeah,

610
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,310
when I'm researching various things about it, sometimes that tech geek

611
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,160
comes out and

612
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,890
shares it, but after all, it's like a convenient person who comes out and researches even if it's a franc, is

613
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,710
n't it

614
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,420
?

615
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,990


616
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,220


617
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,990
But I'd also like to take a

618
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,480
look at it

619
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,070


620
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,600


621
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,240


622
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,000


623
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,400


624
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,530
.

625
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,000
I

626
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,560
've read something called "connect with big data" data

627
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,390
correct, isn't it

628
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,919
? Actually, I

629
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:17,980
like Nisho Hayakawa Bunko

630
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,509


631
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:22,210


632
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,460
.  I think for a moment

633
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,520
that we're going to go with the ax case

634
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,100
.

635
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,740


636
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,389


637
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:38,659


638
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:42,549


639
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,629
I think it's interesting, but I'd like to see the

640
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:47,600
idea of ​​peace, yeah, I want to see the fans and the hugging style ignite

641
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,780


642
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,450
.

643
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,750


644
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,389


645
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:04,909
I'm the Kyoto Prefectural Police, so I'll answer OK, and I love the first Bon

646
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,060
season, right

647
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,680


648
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,500


649
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,850


650
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,820


651
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,760
?  It's quite interesting tomorrow, so I

652
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,580
'll wait and read it.

653
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,250


654
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,350


655
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,230


656
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,750
It's a little bit of a story, but

657
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,759
novels

658
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:41,879
can be covered

659
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:44,309
quite well with descriptions

660
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:46,949


661
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:49,349


662
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:52,090
.  One,

663
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,549
so as long as it's

664
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:58,640
logical, if it doesn't break down logically, there

665
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,160


666
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,050
's no danger that we'll be forced into the details.

667
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,919


668
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,020
What's good about manga,

669
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,840
you and us

670
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,660
Let's talk about access, let's talk about

671
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,750


672
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,610
it.It would be nice

673
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,880
if it sold as

674
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,470
well.How many

675
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,960
years is

676
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,380
it?  It was fun,

677
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,630
right,

678
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,190
Mr. B and his wife

679
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,580


680
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,669


681
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:48,590


682
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,309
.

683
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,670


684
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,930


685
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,820
I do it and openly sell

686
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,300
it, but

687
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,240
that's a comic

688
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,110
book, or I get an account

689
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,910


690
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,660
.

691
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,350
When it comes to having people read it,

692
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,960
recently,

693
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,230
the children of today are more interested in manga and other things than in the past,

694
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:24,340
but

695
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,070
I think it's quite

696
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,900
nice to pass it on to their grandchildren.  It's easy to bake, after

697
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,110
all, that's what I mean, even in

698
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,600
the cleaner's camp lecture, I was selling a little bit

699
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,820
about how to get a pass

700
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,730
, but manga is, well, isn't it

701
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,179


702
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,440
?

703
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,869


704
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:47,759
When I tweet on twitter, the picture is a

705
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,680
thumbnail, and

706
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,370
I'm really eye-catching

707
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:56,300


708
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,920


709
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,090


710
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,419


711
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:04,909


712
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:06,649
.  I'm glad it's so

713
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:08,450
real.

714
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,470


715
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,989


716
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:13,990


717
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,350


718
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,440


719
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,350


720
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,539


721
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:28,269
I feel like I'm really in

722
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:30,129


723
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:31,929


724
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:33,879
demand,

725
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:36,729
and I think there will be more and

726
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:39,609


727
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:42,740


728
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,990
more scenes where j is needed more and more in the future.  When I think about

729
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,430
it,

730
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,660
I don't think it's strange if that way of working is a little less

731
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,330


732
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,850


733
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,770


734
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,780


735
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,660
.

736
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,170


737
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,930
Trying hard to notice various things  I

738
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,360
'm going to do my best and try to make an effort

739
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,090
Wow,

740
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,470
not even one bullet

741
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,850


742
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,920


743
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,050


744
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,630


745
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,419
Kane Spa

746
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:23,960
That's right

747
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,480
, I declared my retirement once, but

748
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,120
if I take it from there, it's better to line up, so

749
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,930
please call pets for about 3

750
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,500


751
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,300


752
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,970
months.

753
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,350


754
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,530
I think the taste is one

755
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,289


756
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:48,450


757
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:51,360


758
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,430


759
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,880
minute.

760
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,890
Hey, I want to say it while drinking a little bit,

761
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,980


762
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,399


763
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,850


764
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,230


765
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,080


766
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,449


767
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:26,630
right?  Hi, it's

768
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,889
by-sama, so

769
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:34,500
what's

770
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,129
going on now?
