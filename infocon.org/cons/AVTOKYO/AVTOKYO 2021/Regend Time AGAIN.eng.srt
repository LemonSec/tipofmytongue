1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,710


2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,100
Well then, I would like to go

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,210


4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,670


5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,260
to the

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,540
sticker corner for the second time today.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,610


8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,250


9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,020


10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,058
This is the logo for England, the United States, and Tokyo

11
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,820
. I think it's the 1003 zetter every year since it was established.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,880


13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,560


14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,750
Actually, I'm also a designer.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,600


16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,560
Yes

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,230
, I would like to hear from you about

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,329


19
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,879


20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,330
the logo of Tokyo on that slightly distant day

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,180


22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,360
.  Aso

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,000


24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,060
: That's right, I'm worried.It doesn't say anything like that.It feels like Mr. Sano Dubai is

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,840


26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,020


27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,380
making it, isn't it?

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,110


29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,830


30
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,439
No, let's go A

31
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,480


32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,950
fact that's not well known

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,090
Well then, I'd like to hear something about Eck It

34
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,970
's this kid's logo, isn't it

35
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,050


36
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,470


37
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,300
?  Well, I think it's something

38
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,270
like oma,

39
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,480
but I think you

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,880
can understand it even if you don't look at it carefully

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,980
.

42
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,410


43
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,500
And since it's Tokyo, it's the Tokyo

44
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,760
Tower motif.

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,520


46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,209


47
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:14,020


48
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,380


49
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,980
It's a motif of the sides, so now I've got that feeling, and I've made

50
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,440
it a

51
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,690
little more realistic

52
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,770
If I don't broadcast it, I'll see the sky tree.

53
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,460


54
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,180


55
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,090


56
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,610
Well, this model is probably

57
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,629
the new one that I made for the online event

58
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,430


59
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,730
last year,

60
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,040
isn't it?

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,850


62
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,290
Um that  It

63
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,660
's been frozen up until now.

64
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,560
Well, I wonder if the 2008, 2011, and 2012

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,710
models

66
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,920
were intermediaries.Is there a design that reminds you of something

67
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,950
?

68
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,020


69
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,800
The one I made,

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,820
8, has a

71
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,840
bit

72
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,720


73
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,910


74
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,260


75
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,709


76
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,459
of color.  When I was waiting, there was someone who was wearing it right now, so I was

77
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,730
working, but the t-

78
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,410
shirt inside was Wolf

79
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,930


80
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,510
.

81
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,189


82
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:48,200


83
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,989


84
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,569


85
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,599
I've already forgotten about this, so I had someone

86
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,120
pick it up for me, but it's probably something by

87
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,190


88
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,840


89
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,730
A.L.I.G.  I can read your dissatisfaction,

90
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,739
but if someone from middle school

91
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,980
and high school says, please

92
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,200
tell me.

93
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,450


94
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,019


95
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,330


96
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,180


97
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,570


98
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,669


99
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:35,160
For example, if you look at the page at the top of the 9th minute, you'll

100
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,449
know that you

101
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,020
can buy Konetz with this design

102
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,950
.  Hey

103
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,740
, I'm thinking that this year's additions will also come out, so I'll be happy with the

104
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,689
sale.

105
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:51,830


106
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,469


107
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,959


108
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,469
At that time, there were many geek books with relatively

109
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,779
masculine designs, but I felt

110
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,269
like I wanted a cute design

111
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:06,529
,

112
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:08,160
so

113
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,200
I made a few T-shirts and books for women at that time.

114
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,600
The pirouette is

115
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,670
doing damage that will make it possible for Sauce Nellie.

116
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,969


117
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:30,509


118
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:31,750


119
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,330


120
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,790


121
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,760


122
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,920
There's one thing you can say that you can choose yourself.

123
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,130


124
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,200


125
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,050


126
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,020


127
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,580
I think

128
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,740
it would have been nice if it was

129
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,099


130
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,389


131
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:09,660


132
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,820


133
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,950
online.  Armor, it

134
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,860
would be nice if I could do this while introducing things

135
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,920
.

136
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,630


137
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,180


138
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,880


139
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,820
Look, it's not even 10 years old,

140
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,960
is it already 10 years

141
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,580


142
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,620
old?

143
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,169


144
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,500


145
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,940


146
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,469
That's right, I brought it with me

147
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:59,270
too, but it's white and blue

148
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,300


149
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,770
.

150
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,890


151
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,930
I think it would be great if I could

152
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,290


153
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,110
do it with everyone. Some people are planning sponsored

154
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,190


155
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,390


156
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,020


157
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,870
goods for fishing.  Someone bought it and

158
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,400
put it together, or

159
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,529


160
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:35,499
rather,

161
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:37,689
it was

162
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:40,620
just in the middle of the day, but yes, now it's time for goods and 2 walls are high, aren't they?

163
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,610
It's a

164
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,990
lot of fun, but it's

165
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,090
only the sponsor goods that are

166
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,620
coming to us.

167
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,139


168
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,000


169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,760


170
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,770


171
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,020
Well then, I've just entered

172
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,940
1003. Thank you very

173
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,889


174
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,310
much.

175
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,190


176
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,220
I

177
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,970
'd like to introduce some of the requests I

178
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,340


179
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,080


180
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,969


181
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,759
've already made.  By the way,

temperature Tokai means nothing

184
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,880
I'm stubborn about the original logo that should be part of the loss,

185
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,400
but after all it's an

186
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,520
easy win here That's about cars such as av

187
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,209


188
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,779


189
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,749


190
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,230

194
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,050
Surfer I planned and made something for you. What's interesting

195
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,600
is that you make that kind of money yourself, but

196
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,520
you need a different soldering iron for that.

197
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,190


198
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,860
From a beginner to an expert in

199
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,020


200
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,580
Tier I wonder if you'll be able to use

201
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,350


202
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,370


203
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,770


204
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,670


205
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,610


206
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,410
it on that day?  As soon as it becomes an original

207
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,920
product, what will be included? After

208
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,650
that, for those who purchased at the booth this time,

209
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,150
there

210
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,880
were a few stickers such as "

211
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,200


212
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,230
Hey, the iron is in that

213
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,470
lath".  I've included what

214
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,740
you'll read, so I hope you'll look forward to the arrival of 8

215
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,450


216
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,190
Come

217
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,270
on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

218
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,090
come

219
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,210
on

220
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,580
.

221
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,420
I think I'd like to end the gm corner. It's 8 cm.

222
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,150


223
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,510


224
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,200


225
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,930


226
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,590


227
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,980
I feel

228
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,180


229
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,720
like this is N country, isn't it Hahn and the

230
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,420
number of

231
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,550


232
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,310


233
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,240


234
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,130
pains?  That

235
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,940
's nice, you can put anything in the basement If you ask me,

236
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,610
it's a blue-eyed thing after all, that av

237
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,740
It would be nice to go to Tokyo

238
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,420
, but it's true that there were other

239
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,330
things ever arobo 6 small items Cables go back cancer

240
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,040
So put this in  And

241
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,020
then, well, it's a normal pen case

242
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,690
, but it's not super cute. That

243
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,370
's nice.

244
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,700


245
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,300


246
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,670


247
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,450
rally

248
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,839
When it arrives, it's bigger, and the real

249
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,210
thing is

250
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,390
cuter.

251
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,460


252
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,329


253
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:56,689


254
00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:00,460
a

255
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,740
This is a

256
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,120


257
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,170


258
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,380
cafe.

259
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,490


260
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,320


261
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,139

263
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,459
That's what I

264
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,518
think,

265
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,970
Honpo Road is much better, and

266
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,060
Anne can get a lot out of things

267
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,880
.

268
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,520


269
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,370


270
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,190
The width is a

271
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,140


272
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,120


273
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,580


274
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,420

279
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,490


280
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,680
little less

281
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,310
than 9 centimeters.  There are different types, but it's

282
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,490
mostly a glass type and a mug cup after

288
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,270
Yes, I think it

289
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,660


290
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,870
's probably something like a

but I don't

295
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,149
think there's a difference.  Beer holder,

, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

303
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,370
Yes, by the way, what kind of raw material is it? The material is

304
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,709
neoprene.

305
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:31,610

309
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,620
I wonder if it went over with a glass to accompany a

310

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,420
It's

323
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,029


324
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,709


325
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,350
about 2 hours.

329
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,190
Well, even though I've been doing that,

330
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,560
I feel like I'm having a little fun

331
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,920


332
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,740

334
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,050
now.  However, it's

335
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,940
this one, but

336
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,300
8 I soldered it myself a little while ago, and it's

337
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,590
glowing now.

338
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,920


339
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,700

343
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,599
This point has an

344
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,669
LED light, so I think

345
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:10,669
you can make it even more shiny.

346
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:13,189


347
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,039


348
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,230
I would appreciate it

349
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,939
if you could share it with me

350
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,799

354
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,890
I wonder if I can wear it while holding it and using it

355
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,250
Do you remember this original language?

356
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,130

That year's

362
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,150
commercial is over, but if I see it,

363
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,810
I'm sure there will be one next year too

370
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,460
Well then, this is Yuru Japan.

371
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,899

379
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,970
I'm doing this one, so

380
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,710
I'm going to lower this one

381
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,670


382
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,289

Ragitan Numbers It's okay It's okay It's

386
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,740
okay

387
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,660
Mr. Himura was having a hard time playing the piano, but

388
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,330
I can't help

389
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,580


390
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,860

393
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:16,580
it.

394
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,190


395
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,159
It's flowing, but it's not flowing right now,

396
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,379
so it's

397
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:25,600
pretty good,

398
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,940
isn't it?

399
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,519

mercer recently

403
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,280
there have been quite a few movies with people from the second division,

404
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,240


405
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,220

they

409
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:57,289
?  But

410
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,179
that kind of hacking doesn't come out

411
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,049


412
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,600


413
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,580

I mean, it's a name, but

417
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,140
it's a p face

418
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,130


419
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,820

441
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,510
like a snake or a security guard going to Mito

Come on, the writer's chant Pick Kevin

453
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,830
Mitnick and his team are already written at that high-pressure party

454
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,880
from the Shimomura side's point of view

455
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,520


456
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,720
.

457
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,880
It's a pattern,

458
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,500


459
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,540
maybe session hijacking.

460
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,320

466
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,510
I thought it was something to think about,

467
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:48,300
but the condition of the sheets seems to be severe.

468
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,090
Well, if this is the case, I'm sure

469
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,660
there's a movie about predicting the tcp sequence number of that racer

470
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,970
.

471
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,990


472
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,250


473
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,980
I was able to predict the tcp sequence

474
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,960


475
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,520

The award that won the prize Hi, my son,

481
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,070
right? It was Uncle Poole's nephew, but it was a misogi

482
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,120
, is

483
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,659
n't

484
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,190
it?

485
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,679


486
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:38,480


487
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,320
Thank you very much

488
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,269

490
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,220
, I wondered why I put it in the tree, I wondered why I was typing this on the beach.

491
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,630


492
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,559

494
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,149
It's

495
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:59,340


496
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,760
kind of weird to say that you

497
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,310
've created an anti-virus yourself, but if you're in Japan, you probably won't be able to do it.

498
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,010


499
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,460


500

100 Shocker I

504
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,490
don't know, but

505
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,679
I think it's probably interesting to read it now, isn't it?

506
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:27,590


507
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,059
It's full, isn't it

508
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:32,290
?  That's cool, isn't it?

509
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,030


510
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,510


511
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,020


512
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,460


513
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,049


514
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:51,440
It's

515
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,710
probably the most popular hacker in the 1990s.

516
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,080


517
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,140


518
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,509

520
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:08,049


521
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:11,659


522
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:13,729
It's quite interesting to see that there

523
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:15,650
's

524
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,740
a hacker coming, so I

525
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,560
'm going to set up a Panipot.

526
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,720


527
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,500


528
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,850
It feels like I'm staring at Wake

529
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,800


530
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,860


531
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,810


532
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,820


533
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,780


534
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,690


535
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,180
.  I still wonder if it would be better if I went

536
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,940


537
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,210


538
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,270
there, yes, yes, but that's right

539
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,860


540
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,440


541
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,360
.  You said Person of

542
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,340
Interest, you liked it,

543
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,910
didn't you?

544
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,900


545
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,370


546
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,239


547
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:19,550


548
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,230


549
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,610
There are a lot

550
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,920
of new ai characters in Mel,

551
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,010
yes, there's a skill banner with the title of love, is

552
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,049


553
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:36,669
n't

554
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:39,460


555
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,789


556
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:45,210
it?  From the mining of raku school data,

557
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,359
or something like that, if a certain

558
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,149


559
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:52,840
flag was raised for this person,

560
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,840
that person's name would come up, and that person's name, or social

561
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,559
security number, would be about a year

562
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,610
, and that person was the culprit.

563
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,520
I don't know if it's a person or a victim.

564
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,220


565
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,070


566
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,860


567
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,400


568
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,559


569
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,669


570
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:22,150
Ai and

571
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,490
eai seem to be

572
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,420
good.

573
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,040
You're working on machine learning hacking and other themes at the time of the event,

574
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,410


575
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,930
aren't

576
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,650


577
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,650


578
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,130


579
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,700
you?  ]

580
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,419
If you go to that type of

581
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,690


582
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,290


583
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,590


584
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,710


585
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,909
thing, at the same time, a book that became the basis of that number called Lucky Driveman was published in Japan,

586
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,279
and various things were done with mathematical models.  Try whispering in a whisper to a person who seems to be the solution to

587
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,300
many

588
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,200
I'm busy using

589
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,870
it, so I'm watching soccer, but Bach The amount of trash has

590
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,950
decreased dramatically, and

591
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,320
people haven't even looked at it

592
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,210
So, you've already finished the Numbers, are

593
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,490
n't you?

594
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,940
At first

595
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,540
, it's 9 o'clock after

596
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,230


597
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,940


598
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,920


599
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,269


600
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:43,940
Cannes, isn't it?  Well, the

601
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,970
first series really isn't. It

602
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,879
introduced various theories of mathematics and used those

603
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:51,680
theories for

604
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,920
various operations.

605
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,660


606
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,030


607
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,760


608
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,920
Because it's

609
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,890


610
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,130
not done, it's more

611
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:15,370
like physics than Lili-sama

612
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,940
.

613
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,990
Corn

614
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,559
That's interesting, but Nekarieo

615
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,690
dj is still troubleshooting Troubleshooting

616
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,830
seems to be sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

617
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,460


618
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,710


619
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,870


620
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,250


621
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,659


622
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:37,559


623
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,389


624
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:42,539
I'm going to go to the distribution site, but I

625
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:46,739
don't have anything to do, so I've assembled it for 15 minutes.

626
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:48,130


627
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,170


628
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,820


629
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,070


630
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,250


631
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,470
I'm sorry to those of you who don't know why, but I'm sorry, but you're the one with legs

632
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,400
.

633
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,030


634
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,980


635
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,919


636
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,799


637
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,989


638
00:31:11,989 --> 00:31:14,210
I'm coming  I was talking about the Son

639
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,290
of Interest earlier

640
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,630
, but this was actually the usual thing, but

641
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,660
it's pretty

642
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,820
good.

643
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,850


644
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,430
I don't have any, but it seems like I have a bit of a will, but it's

645
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,810
not like

646
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,970
I

647
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,800


648
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,900
've awakened

649
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,810
to my ego

650
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,610
.

651
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,520
And does that AI have a personality?

652
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,680


653
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,980


654
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,180


655
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,630


656
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,220


657
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,490
I felt

658
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,039
like I was using a lot of different theories for each of them, and it

659
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,559
was a heat wave.

660
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,650


661
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,600


662
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,970


663
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,080


664
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,690
Jammed

665
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,140
threat intelligence

666
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,200
Gunji-kun's Machina record at that company

667
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,760


668
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,280
.

669
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,640


670
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,880


671
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:38,950


672
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,500


673
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,580


674
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,990


675
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,840


676
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,150


677
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,700


678
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,640
Hey, that's right, I didn't mention it earlier, but that's it. One putter is nice

679
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,460


680
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,240


681
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,800


682
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,290
, but

683
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,500


684
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,440
it's different.  Yes,

685
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,890
Nirvana has appeared.

686
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,020
Esilburner is that Nirvana

687
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,120
Arthur chateau, but it's a

688
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,029
powered substitute lever

689
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,160


690
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,030


691
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,710


692
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,500
.

693
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,570
Well, this was pretty interesting.Is it

694
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,270
something you'd use in the production

695
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,990


696
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,240
?

697
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,740


698
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,160


699
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,350
I've been

700
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,370
there

701
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:52,179
before, so I'll only use aluminum.

702
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:53,919


703
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,760


704
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,300


705
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,670


706
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,380
Actually, I used to be a criminal investigator of that kind of lineage, but

707
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,930
somehow it turned out to be a bad person, and

708
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,990
when I was wondering

709
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,830
why, the distant

710
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,460
brothers suddenly joined the

711
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,159
military commander.  I suddenly entered and couldn't get my head around it I started using my

712
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,070
strength or analog computer

713
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,780
Why do I start solving various things?

714
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,040


715
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,580


716
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,270


717
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,159


718
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,949
No, really, I should just go with my friends and break in and

719
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,560
touch them.

720
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,130


721
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,929


722
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:44,060


723
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,600


724
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,210


725
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,030
It's just a song, but I

726
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,379
