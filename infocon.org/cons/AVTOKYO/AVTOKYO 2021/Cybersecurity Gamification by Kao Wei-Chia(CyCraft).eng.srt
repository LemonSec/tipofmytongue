00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,160
hello everyone thank you for listening

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,359
to this talk

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,080
and since we have only 30 minutes let's

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,440
start quickly

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,840
okay my topic today is cyber security

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,559
gamification and training i will share

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,760
with you how and why we decided to

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,240
design a board game under the theme of

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,359
cyber defense metrics

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,680
my name is panyabo i'm

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,160
currently working as a digital marketing

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,880
at scicraft technology also i came out

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,120
with the idea and organized the deaf

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,280
teams for cyberkin sport games

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,920
here you can see the outline of my talk

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,120
today

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,960
before we start the talk

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,760
since i know that the slogan of av tokyo

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
is no doing no hack right i prepared

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,160
this

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,680
mask

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,509
[Music]

23
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,310
is

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,389
[Music]

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,200
first of all i want to share some common

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
issues we observe and are trying to

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
solve through this board game

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,960
like have you ever been suffered by

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,840
one as cyber security issues and its

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,320
severity start receiving more attention

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,680
than before

32
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,360
more enterprises showed their

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,439
willingness to establish some stronger

34
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,840
defense measures and strategies

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,079
however most of the companies are

36
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,640
lacking in blue team expertises and

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
security analysts

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,759
sometimes

39
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,000
the company's i.t engineers without

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,079
related experiences

41
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,320
are forced to concurrently handle the

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
cyber security issues and incidents for

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,840
their company

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,318
we but we all know that this is really a

45
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,878
dangerous thing because they might not

46
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,680
have enough abilities and experience to

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
deal with the complicated

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
cyber attacks nowadays

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,160
and next not only the employees who are

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,800
not familiar with cyber security also

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,040
the company executives such as their

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
bosses

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
there are so many kinds of defense

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
products in the market now for people to

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,080
choose from

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
those decisions makers who don't

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
understand cyber security techniques

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
well might find it difficult to

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
distinguish the difference between those

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,840
products

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,319
and find out what is really needed and

62
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,720
necessary when making a decision for

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,840
their company

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,599
besides

65
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,560
after interviewing some students and our

66
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,159
company's interns

67
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,959
we noticed that many students who have

68
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,440
learned a tech techniques and even

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,400
participated

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,720
in some competitions such as

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,959
ctf contests

72
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,480
that are confused

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
since the focus and the whole

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,120
environment in ctf competitions are

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,599
different from the real business world

76
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,680
although they have practiced how to

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,640
launch an attack how to attack a website

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,239
how to dig out a new vulnerabilities

79
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,560
they have really strong technical skills

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,720
however they don't really know what

81
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,360
companies need and what ability is

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,519
necessary for them to bring them into

83
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,319
this industry

84
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,680
so here's why we start making a game

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,920
first we want to enrich the training

86
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,319
courses and make it less boring with

87
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,519
interactive activities as the board game

88
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,239
and like vr game to raise people's

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,040
villains to learn or know more about

90
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,319
cyber security concepts

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,439
second as we all know

92
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,920
cyber security is very difficult and

93
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,239
abstract we want to transform the

94
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,720
technology skills and knowledge into

95
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,519
game content to make it far easier for

96
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,080
people to get an initial understanding

97
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,120
of it

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,680
and in our game players could simulate

99
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,918
and experience how to establish

100
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,400
appropriate bluetooth strategies under

101
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,159
their company's circumstances

102
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,560
third

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,199
as an employees in this industry we

104
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
definitely want to promote the

105
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,520
importance of cyber security to the

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,400
public

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
in fact while more and more smart

108
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,280
devices and iot devices are being

109
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,479
utilized in people's daily lives such as

110
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,199
smartphones smart watches smart

111
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,759
refrigerators and you know like other

112
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,240
smart home appliances

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
being hacked by malicious attackers is

114
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,759
no longer an issue that only enterprises

115
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,560
or celebrities needs to be aware of

116
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,440
so

117
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,160
we somehow provide

118
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
fully arranged training courses of

119
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,199
suitable difficulties for students for

120
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,840
free

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,120
and so far we have made four games

122
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,479
on two of them

123
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,680
are visual reality interactive products

124
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,560
and two of them are offline games

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,320
including a gate card game that

126
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,199
collaborated with miter tech framework

127
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,039
and a board game under the scene of

128
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,039
cyber defense matrix which i will

129
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,400
introduce more to you today

130
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
okay then let's go straight into the

131
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,160
game

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,800
the game's name is cyberkins cyber

133
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,320
security life story it was inspired by

134
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,120
monopoly which i see like

135
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,199
everyone here has played at least once

136
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,639
right

137
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,479
before uh in monopoly you buy lands and

138
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,199
houses and earn money by renting your

139
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,600
properties to other players

140
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,880
and in our game you buy defense measures

141
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,759
and

142
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,080
to trying to respond to and fight

143
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
against the attacks you encounter

144
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,319
similar logic right

145
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,600
like the main purpose i mentioned before

146
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
we want players to experience how to

147
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,720
establish an effective and appropriate

148
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,039
defense strategy for their company

149
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,360
while choosing what to purchase so we

150
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,680
select cyber defense mattress as the

151
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,319
core concept presented in the game

152
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,120
we create quite simple rules for this

153
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,919
game in order to let players focus more

154
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,319
on the training contents and the game's

155
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,919
contents while playing

156
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,000
and we want anyone to enjoy the game no

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
matter they have learned

158
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,039
technique

159
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,680
cyber security techniques or not and

160
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
even without technical backgrounds they

161
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,080
can have fun in this game so as we

162
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,800
consider a lot a lot about the

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
difficulties of game content to lower

164
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,599
the technical threshold for related

165
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,039
training events

166
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,960
and courses

167
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,000
at the end

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
at the end of the day learning how to

169
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,199
inventory existing defense measures and

170
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,360
having abilities to make profitable

171
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,759
decisions is the most important thing we

172
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,840
want players to bring home with them

173
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
as for the development team there are

174
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
some security researchers involved in

175
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,240
this project as technical guidance

176
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,039
to ensure that we provide only correct

177
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,960
information for our player which is

178
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
really really serious for me

179
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,319
in addition we also invite award-winning

180
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,639
professional game artists to make

181
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,880
excellent illustrations for the game and

182
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,919
we want to enhance the sophistication

183
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,560
for this game

184
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,120
cyber defense metrics shown on the slide

185
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
now is a framework to help people

186
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,319
navigate their cybersecurity landscape

187
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,479
and find out what they need through a

188
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,039
logical construct the construct starts

189
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,120
with two dimensions

190
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,680
here every column represents a function

191
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,800
in this framework we also describe it as

192
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,520
stages of an attack in the game

193
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
every row here represents a kind of

194
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,560
asset

195
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,840
that might be targeted by the attackers

196
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,479
therefore we can place any defense

197
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,879
measures on the mattress in an organized

198
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,199
weight to check whether we're having the

199
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,520
right and effective defense strategies

200
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,719
or not and to realize where on the

201
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,120
mattress is still empathy says we need

202
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,560
to be more careful of

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,919
we choose cyber defense matrix as the

204
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,640
core concept because it is severe if

205
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,800
decision makers couldn't distinguish the

206
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,519
pros and cons of products they want to

207
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,560
buy

208
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,360
and couldn't take inventories of current

209
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
equipment and measures

210
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,920
that means the decisions maker without

211
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
those knowledge

212
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,240
might probably buy repeated products

213
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,040
like you know waste money waste time on

214
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,320
something unnecessary

215
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,120
this is the map of cyber cans

216
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
you can find greasing four main colors

217
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,080
and which represents four different main

218
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
actions in the game

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,399
step on an orange grid you should draw a

220
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,480
news card which affects all players

221
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,959
step on the green greed you should draw

222
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,199
an incident cards which only affects you

223
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,000
step on the blue grid you can choose one

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,080
defense card from the market place in

225
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
the center of this map to buy

226
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,399
and step on the red read

227
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,640
draw an attack card and you and your

228
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,160
company are under attack

229
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,080
going around the circle once represents

230
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,880
a year in the game and the amount of

231
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
attack damage will be doubled in the

232
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
second year to reflect that every two or

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,040
four years taiwan is under more attacks

234
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,599
than other times because of the election

235
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
these are the news card and the incident

236
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
cards you can see descriptions and

237
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,399
special effects on the card

238
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,240
and these two

239
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,279
are the attack coin in red and defense

240
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,640
card in blue

241
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
let's explain you more about these two

242
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,600
kind of cards

243
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,480
here on the top of attack card you can

244
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,200
check which assets does this attack

245
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,560
targeted

246
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,880
and below are the relevant loss amount

247
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,480
on different stages

248
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,560
here on the defense card you can check

249
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,959
its probabilities of stopping an attack

250
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,800
by the dice point

251
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,440
and the attributes mapping to cyber

252
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
defense matches and the price of the

253
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,160
card

254
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,680
so how do we do offense and defense in

255
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,160
this game for example

256
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,360
when you are under dos attack

257
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,839
since it is an attack targeting network

258
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,880
assets

259
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,959
check if you have any corresponding

260
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,240
defense card from the identify stage if

261
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,440
not go to the next stage so from network

262
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,839
identify network protect they were

263
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,600
detect never respond to network recovery

264
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,399
okay so in this case on the slide assume

265
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,279
that we only have antivirus card now

266
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,360
which means we don't have any cards that

267
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,320
could protect our network we will

268
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,399
lose directly three thousand and five

269
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,120
hundred dollars

270
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,279
otherwise assume that we have firewall

271
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,680
defense card now it's a network project

272
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,959
card so when we check the protect stage

273
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,440
we can begin the defense by rolling the

274
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,160
dice once

275
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,279
if the point is smaller or equal to the

276
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,959
stopping probabilities point on the

277
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,760
firewall card will successfully stop the

278
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,120
attack on protect stage

279
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,079
thus reducing the loss amount to 500

280
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,040
okay one of the core concepts we want to

281
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,160
bring to our players and why we set up

282
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,800
stopping probabilities for defense cards

283
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,839
is that actually there is no 100 safety

284
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,279
in the real world

285
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,519
if anyone tells you that their products

286
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,959
can 100 block all of the unknown threats

287
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,120
it must be a lie

288
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,240
therefore

289
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,959
in order to prevent defending failure we

290
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,440
need defense measures for other stages

291
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,120
on the cdn

292
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,920
matches to fully cover all kinds of

293
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,120
situations

294
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,519
and actually we take real product prices

295
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,200
as reference when we're deciding the

296
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,920
card's price

297
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,079
you'll find some cards that have a

298
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,959
delete sign on the lost amount

299
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,639
this reflects that

300
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,880
there's some attacks which couldn't be

301
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,560
stopped on some particular stage

302
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,120
in the incident cards and used cards

303
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,160
which we since to the time limit we

304
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,240
couldn't explain too much

305
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,959
um they're really interesting

306
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,240
the incident cards actually reflects the

307
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,440
security incidents happens really

308
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,680
suddenly and immediately

309
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,000
and the new scars reflects those

310
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,480
large-scale incidents which affects

311
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,040
wider such as famous severe

312
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,760
vulnerabilities including

313
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,880
heartbleed internal blue shell sharks

314
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,279
vector meltdown and xero logo

315
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,839
okay following let's talk about the art

316
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,800
design of our game

317
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
maybe you will think that it's not even

318
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,199
a cyber security issue why we are

319
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,760
talking about art design but hold on let

320
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,000
me tell you why our design is so

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,560
important

322
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,360
we all know that the key points leads to

323
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,680
a product success is the function and

324
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,959
its quality

325
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,680
however i think what gives people the

326
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,279
first impressions

327
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,360
and attracts them to discover more from

328
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,480
the product is the visualization

329
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,720
this is also one of the most important

330
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,360
things that sometimes will be ignored

331
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,360
when engineers make a new product

332
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,600
actually

333
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,320
great visualizations not only raises

334
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,760
people's interests but also help to lead

335
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
people's thoughts to where we want them

336
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,720
to

337
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,600
so it is so important to improve the

338
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,440
visualization quality

339
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,320
especially for cybersecurity products

340
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,360
turning mass data into clear graphics

341
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,480
may be a huge advantage for analysts

342
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
while they investigate a security

343
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,079
incident

344
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,000
and led them to

345
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,720
grasp grasp the full picture of the

346
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,480
cyber landscape quickly and precisely

347
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,839
so for cyber cans we decided to adopt a

348
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,560
hand-drawn art style along with pastel

349
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,760
color tone to make it memorable and also

350
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,519
shorten the distance between cyber

351
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,760
security and public as you can see on

352
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
the slide is

353
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
from from my opinion it's cute and

354
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,800
colorful which will bring a relaxing and

355
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,319
joint move to our players

356
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,519
in the game we design characters and

357
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,839
define symbolic meanings for each

358
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,680
character

359
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,320
for example the robot named crafty

360
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,560
represents the defense side the

361
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,880
suspicious guy in a red hoodie is the

362
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
hacker who represents the offense side

363
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,480
the white human is a normal person such

364
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,800
as non-i.t related employees in your

365
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,279
company and the white human with both

366
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,240
have is a bad guy or a stupid decision

367
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,959
maker

368
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,600
in addition we use a lot of repeated

369
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,440
elements in the game to create

370
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
cohesiveness

371
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,839
like the little virus the chain the lock

372
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,160
the injector and the fission tools

373
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,680
in total we made over i think over 70

374
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
cards in this board game

375
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,160
every single card has their own special

376
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,040
design factors and behind stories

377
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,000
we put many many efforts into combining

378
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,720
illustrations and card effects and

379
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,800
real-world cybersecurity situations

380
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
together

381
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
for example the stuxnet malware is

382
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
famous because it's an attack targeting

383
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,959
nuclear power station

384
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,720
so we put some nuclear site on the

385
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,279
illustration image when you see the red

386
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,759
team assessment card echoing the

387
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,519
character design philosophy i just

388
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,160
mentioned there are three robots wearing

389
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
red hoodies and having attack tools with

390
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,519
them

391
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,519
it looks like they are doing something

392
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,160
bad and it looks like some attacks are

393
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,639
happening but you will immediately

394
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,120
notice that they are good guys for sure

395
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,560
they are maybe

396
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,360
trying to imitate malicious attackers

397
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,359
since you know robots in this game

398
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,119
represents the defense side

399
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,559
okay last this is the conclusion chapter

400
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,079
so far we've supported students courses

401
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,880
games events to teach them how to play

402
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,160
this board game

403
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,959
and the knowledge inside the game and we

404
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,679
also hold four training courses for

405
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,559
enterprises as well most of the players

406
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,640
have positive comments toward the game

407
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,120
to keep high quality and ensure the

408
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,679
players learn something from the game we

409
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,320
insist that every table should be

410
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,720
matched with one coach from us

411
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,320
who must be familiar with both again

412
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
and the related techniques mentioned in

413
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,559
the game

414
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
in a recent event

415
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,320
um we did pre-test and post-test which

416
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,280
with about 54 students

417
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
where only 20 of them have learned cyber

418
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,520
security before

419
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,799
his course became obviously better after

420
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,520
the course notice that almost no one

421
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,240
could answer questions like which row

422
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,440
and column is antivirus placed on cdn

423
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,799
before the course

424
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,000
they're filling answers like um no idea

425
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,799
i don't know haha

426
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,840
well zzz something like that

427
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,960
however

428
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,120
after playing the game

429
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,960
the correct rate of this kind of

430
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,720
questions raised to about 11

431
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,440
and the students started to

432
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,679
wrote out what they thought the answer

433
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,480
was

434
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,440
and explain why

435
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,320
on the other hand for similar multiple

436
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,039
choice questions such as which is not

437
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,480
the kind of function at cdn and which is

438
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,760
not an asset on cdn

439
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,480
the correct rate increased sharply

440
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,919
which shows

441
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,160
you can see this is the pre-test and

442
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,320
preparation is the answer and this is

443
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,679
the posthead system is the answer

444
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,400
so as you can see this shows the effect

445
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,480
of letting students get initial

446
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,880
understandings toward the cyber defense

447
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,280
mattress means the game

448
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,240
really did work

449
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,360
okay uh above is all of my sharing

450
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
and the last thing i would like to share

451
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,840

eight brand new character cards

455
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,679
will be added into the game with

456
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,799
respective special effects

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,919
oh besides uh we made a japanese version

463
