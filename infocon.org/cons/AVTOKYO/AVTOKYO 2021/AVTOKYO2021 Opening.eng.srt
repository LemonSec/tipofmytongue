186
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,179
I think there are a lot of people who are having trouble figuring out what kind of countermeasures they should take,

187
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,140
so today, people say that, and it's fine

188
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,179
.

189
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,059


190
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,219
I'm going to talk about the hardships of those who are working hard to take countermeasures,

191
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,470


192
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,779
so today is Part 1.

193
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,820


194
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,390
Well, Mr. Kala talked about

195
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,690
it, and the next thing is, well, I

196
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,310
didn't talk frankly for 30 minutes,

197
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,530
including myself.  For the first 10 minutes or

198
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,630
so, we talked about a lot of things

199
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,400


200
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,930


201
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,690


202
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,920
.  Let's all get together and

203
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,050
talk a little bit about actions.

204
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,820
Rather than part 1, the tool is probably black, and it's an

205
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,000
interesting story.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,519


207
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,800


208
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,570
I'm so

209
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,700
busy, but I want to do my best, so I'm looking forward to working

210
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,620
with you again this year.

211
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,580


212
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,400


213
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,820
ーー

214
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,490
I'll do two good things, just in case Fishing

215
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,260
Special zone text

216
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,360
The url of the zoom distribution is posted on the text channel,

217
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,970
so please access from there and the distribution

218
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,440
will

219
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,270
not be like this basically.  The video distribution will be done with zoom

220
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,580
, so I hope you can watch

221
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,440
it. Yes, please check the implementation

222
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,930
page, discord, etc.

223
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,400


224
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,990
There is a live schedule part-time job called Lever on the web page of Tokyo

225
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,330
.

226
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,270
It

227
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,960
's

228
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,220
machine learning, but Mr. Arai, my garbage

229
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,930


230
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,089
depends on the strength, but it seems that Mr. bouvet and the clones will do various things with their

231
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:36,920
own themes

232
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,680


233
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,579
.

234
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,109


235
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,050
What

236
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,120
is it, but in the main work,

237
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,610
Mr. Jiburin, who is eating in the talk,

238
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,070


239
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,240
is a group of people who don't have a cup

240
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,480


241
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,920


242
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,510
.

243
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,250


244
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,260


245
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm thinking about talking about various things about this venue.In the

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,820
30-minute frame, I'll talk about

247
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,290
how embedded linux

248
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,100


249
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,500
works.  I'm thinking of going so far as to talk about what kind of troubles there were and how

250
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,570
the

251
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,790
firmware worked

252
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,610
if I did this or that.  We have prepared a variety of other content, such

253
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,540
as a workshop on how to use a soldering iron, as part of a polite study group,

254
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,600


255
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,220


256
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,139
so please join us.

257
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:55,750


258
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,380


259
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,180


260
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,770


261
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,380
There are some people who can shoot one more time if you ask them to talk a little

262
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,270
with their discord or something like

263
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,110


264
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,490
that.

265
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,590


266
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,780


267
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,970


268
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,420


269
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,670


270
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,440


271
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,270
I'm Kentaro walking on google.

272
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,840


273
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,550
The most cool way of life is

274
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,610
approaching q I wonder if it's

275
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,860
Shibuya or a

276
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,870
villa-like mute nurse Departing from

277
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,110
that place for a while I wonder if Baby-kun is in that place

278
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,370


279
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,460


280
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,230
The next morning at 8:00 am

281
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,940


282
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,250
, there's no view over there.

283
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,120


284
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,390


285
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,090


286
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,340


287
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,220


288
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,430


289
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,980
So, when I asked, no one was there, but

290
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,120


291
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,529
tjr Opinion There's no announcements like this

292
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,329
today, but I'm

293
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,410


294
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,420
eating at the bar

295
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,199


296
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,730


297
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,720


298
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,399


299
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,500
I

300
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,139


301
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,589
've just passed 23 kilograms, so more than half of them have

302

come.

303
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,150

311
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,869


312
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:02,240


313
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,630


314
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,080


315
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,600
I

316
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,380
'm tired of being in the corps Come

I haven't eaten for a while now, so everyone is making a

341
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,109
mistake,

A 3-on-1 year-old class

361
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,860
fan introduced me to a card game I played,

362
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,940


363
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,080
so I'll do

364
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,510
it because I made a ring badge, that av Tokyo

365
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,640
badge, so I'll introduce it later

366
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,690
.

367
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,200
But then again, Natake Nasuke from Inter, who made it for Baby Tokyo two years ago, made

368
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,610


369
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,040
another version this year, so

370
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920


371
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,889
there's a category called Do that supports Nakasone online, so there are various things to do while playing.

372
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,540
I'm thinking about doing some soldering,

373
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,130
so please try participating in

374
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,339


375
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:29,600


376
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,139


377
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:34,380


378
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,190


379
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,220
Matofa.

380
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,940


381
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,400


382
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,360


383
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,600


384
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,940
Let's go with the drink hack of [music]

385
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,449
