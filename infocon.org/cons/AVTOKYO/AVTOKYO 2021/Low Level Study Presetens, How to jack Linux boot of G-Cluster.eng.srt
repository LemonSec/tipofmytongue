1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,230


2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,300
Okay, I'd like to ask you to show a study group at that level

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,600


4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,430


5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,490


6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,860
.

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,020
I'm sorry, I

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,280


9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,750
didn't get to know people right away, so

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,039
this is all of a sudden.

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,490


12
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,970


13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,000
They make things and have fun with them, and so on.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,809


15
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:39,010
Well, every week, or maybe even every month,

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,830
we hold regular study

17
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,850


18
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,960
sessions, and then we

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,500
hold

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,150
sessions and workshops.

21
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,550
I've been losing weight every time in the form of a meeting,

22
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,300


23
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,880
so what I'm going to do this time

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,100
is bell starry sessions and

25
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,500
workshops on the discord road, and running.

26
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,559


27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,500
By the way, this is right. It's

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,000
just that the key has arrived and

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,680
I've been doing it for a while.

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,579


31
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:11,540


32
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,110


33
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,350


34
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,400


35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,530
Hirabe: I'm doing something like a high-level order,

36
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,380


37
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,930
and I'm thinking that I'll talk about the things I made a presentation about that this time.

38
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,060


39
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,670


40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,310
We will hold a workshop to actually make a soldering iron.

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,619


42
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,810


43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,149


44
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:44,409


45
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,299


46
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,280
A link will be prepared so that you can purchase it immediately,

47
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,259
so please come and join

48
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:53,500
us. From 6 o'clock, we will broadcast the program remotely with

49
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,049
a body study session underlined as a usb memory hack,

50
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,440


51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,780
so please take a

52
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,980
look.  I'm sorry to inform you that the

53
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,360
session was quite abrupt, but this time

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,730


55
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,949
, I think I'll talk about the announcement of the t cluster.

56
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,660


57
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,260


58
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,780


59
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,530
I'll adjust the placement

60
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,860
Yes, so I think we should talk about it

61
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,870


62
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,230


63
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,450


64
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,120


65
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,980
.  I'd like to see only what's on the screen

66
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,030
, please

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,030
Share it, maybe

68
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,860
it should be cool

69
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,320
Maybe I'm not in a state where I can see it on discord

70
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,510


71
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,829


72
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,780


73
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,400


74
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,489
I

75
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,140


76
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,140


77
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,619


78
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,090


79
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,220
'm having a bit of a delivery problem right now.

80
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,440


81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,240


82
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,550
I would like to talk about myself.I am a

83
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,460
Studio Ghibli.This is a regular study session, so I would like to

84
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,030
talk about

85
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,160


86
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,940
it.  My name is Yamada,

87
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,800
and I would be very happy if you could cut it for me at a low temperature

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,270
.

89
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,120


90
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,030


91
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,220


92
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,320
I'm a person, for

93
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,030
example, I'm on this Amazon

94
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,490


95
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,310
Dash button.

96
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,560


97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,790
It's called a

98
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,290
pqi air card,

99
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,810
but it's actually a small card that's working, and I

100
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,979
asked it

101
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,100
to be a system for playing karaoke animations,

102
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,610
and changed the video internally in the sd card.

103
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,560
I was doing things like making new videos, and I

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,030
was doing something like new this time,

105
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,830
this is the g cluster I'm talking about,

106
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,120
but this

107
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,850


108
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,580
one too.

109
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,380
So I thought it would be really fun to analyze it, so I thought I'd

110
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,389
just let you do this for a moment

111
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,400
. Thank you again

112
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,419
.

113
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,340


114
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,770
Even if you say

115
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,380
It's not just the surroundings, for example,

116
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,990


117
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,480
the silver plate behind the silver plate that was said to be a

118
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,400


119
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,530


120
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,260
fan of changing the game here and there.  Or you can

121
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,230
adjust the angle, restore the settings of this

122
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,900


123
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,240
button, and do other things like

124
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,250
repairing toys like this

125
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,650
.  I'm glad that

126
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,810
you can understand that

127
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,180
I'm a person who really likes low-level

128
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,940


129
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,320
music in this way.

130
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,110
It

131
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,600
's a big theme that I want people to feel familiar with.

132
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,090
To be honest, it's a little difficult story, and it's a

133
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,740


134
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,290
story that I don't really understand.

135
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,020


136
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,030


137
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,130
If you want to have fun with hardware hacking, I think it's a success

138
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,350


139
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,820


140
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,620


141
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,420


142
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,610
.

143
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,200


144
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,510


145
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,940
I'm going to talk about what I'm going to announce

146
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,230


147
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,030


148
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,860
because I've been living with Jack

149
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,510
linux booting.  I'm

150
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,150
going to talk about the crafter. First,

151
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,409
I'll explain what a chi-cluster is. I

152
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:26,629
'll also explain what a g-cluster is.

153
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,099


154
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,019


155
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,360


156
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,269


157
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,610


158
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,259
However, I

159
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,719
don't think you

160
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:44,400
know what kind of things to put in and

161
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,229
refer to when remodeling.

162
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:46,860


163
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,380
After that, I

164
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,060
will talk about relaxing with Betty Sono in the next demonstration. How does

165
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,130
that embed linux

166
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,289
boot?  I thought it would be a little difficult to understand if I didn't know how to go through the high

167
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,210
maneuvering procedure,

168
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,220


169
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,710
so at the end I'll

170
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,900
talk about the number of new boot c case built-

171
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,720
in nax boot oh oh oh oh oh oh

172
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,730
In the

173
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,010
demonstration section, I

174
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,710
will first explain how to develop a plaster shell.

175
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,889


176
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:20,060


177
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,969


178
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,789


179
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:28,759


180
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,919
I've found a way to execute the approval code with the raw Sieg Duster, so I'll talk about it.

181
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,419


182
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,140


183
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,580
I

184
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,650


185
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,140
would like to talk about this. This time it will be a 30-minute talk, but I

186
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,550
would be happy if you could stay with me until the end

187
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,800


188
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,020


189
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,030
.

190
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,400
In the first place, what is a cluster

191
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,270
? If

192
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,120
you look at the official page from g,

193
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,400
it says it's a cloud gaming device

194
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,190
. Recently, it

195
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,050
was nvidia now.

196
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,669


197
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:08,410


198
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,370


199
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,500
Well, what kind of games are actually out there?

200
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,100
Let's take a look

201
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,140


202
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,020


203
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,990
.  What is this? It's

204
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,700
like a simulation game. It looks really

205
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,300
interesting.

206
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,480
[Music]

207
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,299
Everyone, this game is all two generations

208
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,700


209
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,220


210
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,070


211
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,530
.  But to be honest, I honestly think it

212
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,300
's a little weird to use this as gaming hardware right now

213
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,760


214
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,470


215
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,910
.

216
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,930


217
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,960
I have 256 mb memory

218
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Arch has 256 mb storage

219
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,120
512 mb memory

220
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,070
And wi-fi, usb, Rie, it's a

221
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,110
good basic preference, and it

222
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,589
's all listed, but this is the most

223
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:11,050
important thing.

224
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,950


225
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,290


226
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,420


227
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,970
But really, I think they're

228
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,639
still selling at a price that you can probably buy for a few hundred yen,

229
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:24,550
so everyone, please take a look

230
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,519


231
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,529


232
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,379
.  It

233
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:35,139
seems that in the past it was given out for free at a certain place, so this

234
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:38,050
time, I think that Sieg Daistar

235
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,990
is not just a

236
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,779
game, but a cheap

237
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,910
linux board, so

238
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,180
I think I'll take a look at it this time.

239
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,089
Well then, we're actually going to remodel this, but

240
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,300
the pins for remodeling are properly growing,

241
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,880
right?

242
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,850


243
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,310
It's

244
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,190
ready to use, so once you use

245
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,170
it, you can easily start

246
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,790
remodeling.Hinata, let's have fun!

247
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,310


248
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,520


249
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,390


250
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,210
Well, I'll explain in a little more detail about the actual remodeling story at that time,

251
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,160


252
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,310
so please enjoy it.

253
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,020


254
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,880


255
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,550
Let

256
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,700
's talk about the gpl source code, which is important when remodeling

257
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,560


258
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,110
Yes gpl source code features

259
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,470
gpa Which source code has three

260
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,250


261
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,610
?  And

262
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,850


263
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,149
you can see the fact that trade secret code and documents can sometimes be set on fire, and

264
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,190


265
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,600
you can see that it's a fairly chaotic society.

266
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,850


267
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,930
First of all, it is said that you can look at the

268
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,660
business source code production

269
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,110
Ford

270
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,899


271
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,690


272
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,880


273
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,000


274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,740
.  source code  As written here, there are various conditions such as what

275
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,839


276
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,519


277
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,649
is good and

278
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,350
what is bad.

279
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,320
This is why if you

280
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,720


281
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,300


282
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,730
modify the source code, there is a rule in this gpa source code that you must disclose the source code

283
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,760
.

284
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,610


285
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,270


286
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,010
Of course, we provide the source code of 0 Cheek Big Star,

287
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,280
but also Nintendo, and really

288
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,680
Sony

289
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,690


290
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,970


291
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,370


292
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,920
.  What I'm trying to say is that

293
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,750
this is the gpa source code.

294
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,300
Of course, only the part that uses

295
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,639
gpn is made public, but in

296
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,500
the case of environment pit embedded linux, the

297
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,110
relax kernel itself is gpl

298
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,870
. Start inax.  The

299
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,360
most famous bootloader used to

300
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,339
do this

301
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,779
is uboot, but uboot is also licensed under gpn, and

302
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:31,419
all other os ace

303
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,399
projects are also licensed under gpgate.

304
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,249


305
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,099
Well, not all, but many

306
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:41,409
of the regular nightscape projects are all

307
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,629
graded as jeep, so

308
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,509
what does that mean?

309
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:49,550


310
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,770
Then, since almost

311
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,779
everything is made of GPL source code, you can

312
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,150
know

313
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,940
almost all the source code of all products

314
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,790
by looking at the source code of

315
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,980


316
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,140


317
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,350


318
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,080
GPL.  Nekoko, please take a look at the definition

319
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,990
. This sounds like Japanese. I

320
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,660
can't do a forced translation of Pedia into English

321
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,920


322
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,320


323
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,020
.

324
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,330


325
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,250
You can check

326
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,240


327
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,900
the behavior and behavior of the program written here

328
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,680
and modify it.  It

329
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,840
is

330
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,630
written here as a rough condition

331
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,139
of this GPL that you can do it.

332
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,359


333
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:46,649


334
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,239


335
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,399
It says

336
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,019
must be license In other

337
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,379
words

338
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,389
, it's my first

339
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,819


340
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,699
time

341
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:05,379
to publish reverse

342
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,680
engineering.  The strength

343
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,569
of this gpa is that the source code can be

344
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:12,810


345
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,750


346
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,520


347
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,980
remodeled on that day.  This is

348
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,930
the source code for Zeek Star,

349
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,600
but this source actually

350
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,640
contains a lot of

351
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,800
documents like this

352
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,540


353
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,830
, isn't it?

354
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,870
There are other things like this, and there's also

355
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,170


356
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,200
production code that's really interesting, but I think I

357
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,660
'll omit talking about cats here.

358
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,420


359
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,150
Why

360
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,920
don't you take a look at the gpr source code?

361
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,880


362
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,190


363
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,820


364
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,640


365
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,990
If you look here

366
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,350
, this is the NES on the right and the

367
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,470
Mega Drive on the right. Actually

368
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,140
, both share the same code, and if

369
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,750
you look at the source code that has a lot of atmosphere with the manufacturer,

370
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,010
well, it's the

371
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,530
same as the Pon for Famicom Day.  There were times when the code for the keymap of the other layer was included.Well,

372
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,900


373
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,190


374
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,860
the layers are a really chaotic

375
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,510
society.If you look at the linux kernel,

376
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,610
you'll understand, but the codes of various companies

377
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,150
are peaceful.  You can

378
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,270
also see the code of companies that you really don't get tired of.

379
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,940


380
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,220


381
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,110
If

382
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,329


383
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:48,579
you look at the linux industry tail and the industry, there are source codes that you can read even if you are motivated,

384
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,499
so please take a

385
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,379
look.

386
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,869


387
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:58,449
So, everyone, please take a

388
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:02,290
look at this. I learned about the modification story and

389
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,180
the dragon-like story of the

390
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,190


391
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,490


392
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,800
key map.

393
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,690
Booting linux

394
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,010
Up to this point.

395
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,050
First, I talked about

396
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,420
what a g-cluster is and

397
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,430
what the gpl source code

398
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,800
is.

399
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,260


400
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,720


401
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,330
I'm going to talk about whether it's going to

402
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,550


403
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,250


404
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,470


405
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,779
start up or

406
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:42,649
not.

407
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,500
It's

408
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,450
called booting, but it doesn't start until it starts, but

409
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,209
after stepping on several other small boot loaders

410
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,570
, the linux kernel comes and

411
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,360
what to

412
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,400


413
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,500
do.  But this time, I think

414
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,330
it's a good idea to say that the configuration of the cluster is like this

415
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,970
. In a

416
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,089
cluster, the first step is

417
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,459
the boot process.

418
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,560


419
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,388


420
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:18,759
It's called spl, and this

421
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:21,429
spl selects tpa degree and tpr

422
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:22,990
calls linux.

423
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,029


424
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:27,990


425
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,900
The very first stage groove code is a

426
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,210
secondary program Calling order spl

427
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,980
from spi flash

428
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,030
What is this

429
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,130


430
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,340


431
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,010
?  It

432
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,160


433
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,290


434
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,950
's the code of the child who read the early stage code to boot the tiny u boot

435
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,200
As for how to call it,

436
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,080
other peripherals, such as this memory,

437
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,080
have not yet been initialized, so they are called neck dams

438
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,180


439
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,890
.

440
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,740
If there

441
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,510


442
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,810
are 4 bootloaders in the initial stage, then

443
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,730


444
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,950
what does the loader do on that day?

445
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,500


446
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,530
It is initialized to a state and then it is said this number of

447
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,770
times.The car is

448
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,200
a storage device with 250 bytes as

449
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,250
I said earlier.The boot loader called u boot that is in there

450
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,060
is expanded on

451
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,390
memory.

452
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,260
If you expand the boot loader called u boot on the top, this dragon

453
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,380
boot will also have the linux kernel

454
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,350
and the root

455
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,850
file system necessary

456
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,810
to boot it.

457
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,220


458
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,200
So here's uboot, which has

459
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,000
quite advanced functions.

460
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,059


461
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,190


462
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,820


463
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,059
There is also

464
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,750
a function to verify whether the end is written properly, and depending on the item,

465
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,720
it can also expand highly compressed dondon, and also

466
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,870
perform things like encryption and decryption

467
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,480
.

468
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,059


469
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,500
However, if I try to boot this dragon boot as it is, it wo

470
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,419
n't boot well, so I

471
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:33,940
'll rewrite the settings to make it a little better.

472
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,110


473
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,320


474
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,200
It

475
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,289
is the most important boot loader for booting Dogugi, Nax's mother and sister

476
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:46,990


477
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,520


478
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,960


479
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,659
.

480
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,299


481
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,309
I would be grateful if you could think that I am talking about the groove of

482
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:00,529


483
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:02,330


484
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,160


485
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,990


486
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,330


487
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,880
uboot.  First of all, Sieg Duster

488
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,130
looks good.  It's a sound gaming device cloud

489
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,250
gaming device, but this time

490
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,130


491
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,410
I think I'll use it as a relaxing device as a data Kusu Chiba City

492
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,130


493
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,479
and the gps pr total code

494
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,700
can be seen as the source code of the product

495
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,549
and reverse engineered

496
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,540
Well, you

497
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,630


498
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,580
can think of it as permission for remodeling, so you can feel

499
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,420
safe while maintaining psychological safety while

500
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,000
remodeling this time.

501
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,430
The bootloader is

502
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,050


503
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,300
divided into 3 sound stages It is divided into orbital stages

504
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,280
, so if you

505
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,100
want to boot boot linux, you do

506
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,610
n't need to make a dom, and this part is

507
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,770
a dom for booting with uv and .

508
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,510
So, yes

509
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,400
, that's all, so far so far, so I've talked about it in the lecture section

510
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,240
, but this time I'm going to start the

511
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,140
demonstration section,

512
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,230
so I'm going to talk about actually remodeling the g class.

513
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,200
First of all

514
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,300
, let's

515
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,149
talk about creating a

516
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:21,399


517
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:24,429


518
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,489
shell for g-cluster

519
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:29,510
.

520
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,580
When it comes to the shell area, even if it's a

521
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,920
home or a text base,

522
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,630
if you type in a local area, it just comes

523
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,910


524
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,400


525
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,480
back, isn't it?

526
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,420


527
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,820


528
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,340
gCraft's TV spree is in the form of sending dose values ​​to

529
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,800
a pipeline made up of rebow, gold, and copper,

530
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,240
and sending them to a high-resolution pipe.

531
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,440


532
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,750
But it's not designed to directly run the gui here

533
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,480
. It's not like the powerful x

534
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,340
window system is

535
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,500
running, but an

536
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,150
embedded

537
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,320
system called direct fb is running.

538
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,380
I can't do anything else like send a picture of this as it

539
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,049
is, so this time, I thought I'd

540
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:26,200
use this pipeline well to display the text.

541
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,110


542
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,480
Then

543
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,790
I looked at a lot of gba source code, and then

544
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,910
there was this kind of screw hole in the text.

545
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,670


546
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,280


547
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,559


548
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,290
Okay, so now the character string display is

549
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,650
OK.

550
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,780


551
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,940


552
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,990


553
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,840


554
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,630


555
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,820
I have no choice but to make it myself

556
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,100
First of all, the serial data is

557
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,200
falling to the place called event 1 in the code section, and I found out that the

558
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,330
keyboard value was somehow acquired.

559
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,760


560
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,920
If you want to see it, you want to take a bath

561
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,040


562
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,010
. First of all, when you press a

563
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,380
button, the key code for that button is displayed as

564
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,060


565
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,400
text.  I

566
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,660


567
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,950


568
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,680


569
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,710
was able to complete a shell in which commands are actually displayed when characters are entered, so I was able to make it by myself.

570
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,130


571
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,020
It's up to the application, but

572
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,539
I'd like to put it in a state where it can actually boot

573
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:49,809


574
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:52,929
.

575
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:55,000


576
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,059
So

577
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,860


578
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,250


579
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,919
, I bought 100 of them at the North School, so I soldered them to each issue, and I'm going to do this.

580
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,890


581
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,640


582
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,950
I can't do anything that I want to

583
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,180


584
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,730
modify using this pin, isn't

585
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,860
it?

586
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,890


587
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,510
I

588
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,640
was trying to find a way to run the code

589
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,160
.

590
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,690


591
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,120


592
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,290


593
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,050


594
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,570


595
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,760
Then I found this code  First of all,

596
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,140


597
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,150
from the point of view of the cameo factory factory and the image, there

598
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,610
was something like this firmware or image that was

599
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,950


600
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,750
used to

601
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,240
upgrade the firmware

602
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,760


603
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,950
with a command.

604
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,630
It

605
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,360
was written in the code that the image can be called a firmware or an image.I thought that

606
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,210
if I used it well in the archive, I wouldn't be able to

607
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,460
write custom firmware with just a usb

608
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,940


609
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,429
.

610
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,970
I

611
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,760
was able to run an image that can be used with u boot in Oiso City,

612
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,890
but this

613
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,600
failed at the security process.

614
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,799


615
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,900


616
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,870
Well, this

617
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,950
is not the place

618
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,600
to go. Now that we understand that we need to be able to execute code with a high number of members

619
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,300
, we will start the security process from here.

620
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,160


621
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,410


622
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,270


623
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,370
Well, again, I heard about the gpl source code

624
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,790
, so I didn't know the source this time, so I

625
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,370
'll read the binary

626
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,650
as it is and read it after reverse engineering.

627
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,330


628
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,910


629
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,950


630
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,500
Well, now that we're able to have applications, we're supposed to be able to do it at Mety Meiji, so we'll

631
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,290


632
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,410
develop this into an image, and from

633
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,770
there we'll bring something called this up.

634
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,200


635
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,870


636
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,460
I found an implementation

637
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,470
that executes up .

638
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,020


639
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,260


640
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,030
Come on farm and image

641
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,500
I was working with dew and permissions

642
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,830


643
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,370


644
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,140


645
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,500
.  I was asked to change the settings of the

646
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,950
groove and let it run, so I thought

647
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,970
about it.

648
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,920
This is what you should do after

649
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,810
that, and the command at the time of the envelope on the boot side

650
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,050


651
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,700
is

652
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,610
just as it is.

653
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,200
I rewrote the method I was told

654
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,019


655
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:14,500
to try something like booting in a good

656
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,260
and secure method, and I thought that if I did it, I would be able to do it

657
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,230


658
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,909


659
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:22,720
.  I

660
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,659
've made it so that when you run this, telnet will also work behind the scenes,

661
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:28,220
so

662
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,210
if you use this, you'll

663
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,039
be able to teak and tweak it yourself

664
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,299


665
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:37,399


666
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:39,739
.  However,

667
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:41,600
even if it's just an extract,

668
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,119
there's no use for it without a big application

669
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,999
, is

670
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,100


671
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,890
n't it

672
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,800
?  At the study meeting, actually,

673
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,330
there is a site called

674
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,880
Scrapfox here, where g-cluster analyzes poisons

675
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,460
are put together by everyone.

676
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,160


677
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,230


678
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,260


679
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,140
What should I do to make the sound flow

680
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,480


681
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,010
? There is an animation like g cluster fluffy at boot time, but I've been investigating

682
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,580
various hack methods such as how to do it twice

683
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,850


684
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,230
.

685
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,690


686
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,820


687
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,700


688
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,710
There are events where everyone tries to create a ruckus with linux, not just the g-down,

689
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,730


690
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,880
and other low-level related things.

691
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,710


692
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,890
So if you

693
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,900
are interested in this kind of development, I

694
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,450
would like you to participate

695
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,179


696
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:52,130
in the study session.

697
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,399
That's why

698
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,040


699
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,250
we'll have a session after collaborating

700
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,850
with AV,

701
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,509


702
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,100


703
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,260


704
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,830
starting at 4:00.  usb

705
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,410
memory hack  So, I think

706
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,860


707
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,510


708
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,980
that there is a USB memory that will come out if you insert it even though it is only 8 GB, for example, but

709
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,390


710
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,539
it is a low-level question of how to make it.

711
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:28,460


712
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,530
Thank you all for listening this time.

713
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,050
If you read the gpl source code,

714
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,360
you can do anything.Hardware

715
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,610
hacking is a lot of fun.

716
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,580
I'm sure it's for Hanyu.

717
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,340
I've taken the sauce I'm using this time

718
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,750
and bought it in my car, so

719
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,670
everyone please stand up.

720
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,320


721
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,300


722
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,419
