Actually, the amazing

107
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,310
thing about the inkstone is that you can choose the color of suicide yourself,

108

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,730


182
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,490
ask you early.

183
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,870


184
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,420
Well, at the booth, um, from now on, um, it's

185
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,880
perfect as I told

186
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,329
you earlier.

187
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:29,819
In addition to this, we

188
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,749


189
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:33,239
are planning to sell some of the dead stock type products

190
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,339
on a limited basis, so

191
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,679
I would like to introduce them later

192
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,960


193
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,070


194
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,470
.  I

195
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,050
'm sorry, but I

196
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,279
bought one at the time

197
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,899
and Perry put it out based on this

198
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,720


199
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,149


200
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,089
.

201
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:08,240
I'm thinking of tapping

202
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,779


203
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,650


204
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,339


205
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,310
Honraku.

206
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,260


207
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,630


208
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,690


209
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,269
There are some things that are

210
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:43,660
thicker, so

211
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,580
I'm going to ask you

212
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,310


213
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,440
a little bit

214
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,660
.  When I looked for it,

215
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,820
I found a little difficulty, so this time

216
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,480
I think it's a little special for me.

217
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,690


218
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,150


219
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,340


220
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,470


221
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,730


222
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,740
