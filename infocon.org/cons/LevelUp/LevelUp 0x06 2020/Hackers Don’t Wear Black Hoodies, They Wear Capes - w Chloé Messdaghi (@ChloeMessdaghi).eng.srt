trying to get done as a community and

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,559
and the need for clarity and

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,420
understanding at the interface between

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,820
hackers and the organization's they're

18

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,290
security and when I'm not doing that I'm

51
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,300
an ethical hacker advocate meaning I'm

52
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,730
trying to fight for rights for the

53
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,250
community in ways of bringing diversity

54
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,860
inclusion to also making sure that we

55
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,380
have new legislation and to update our

56
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,140
press or marketing in other words the

57
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,799
media what exactly is a hacker when I'm

58
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:59,269
not doing that I'm the president and

59
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:01,190
co-founder of wou SEC which is a woman

60
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,780
of security we have chapters all over

61
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,730
the world I'm also the founder of women

62
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,880
hackers and actually this month is our

63
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,549
one-year anniversary so basically it's

64
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:12,350
non-binary and women around the world

65
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,390
hack at all levels and we're all

66
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,850
together running the show it's a lot of

67
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,010
fun when I'm not that on the podcast

68
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,019
therefore I TSP maizing the uncommon

69
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:23,090
journey with Phil Wiley you probably

70
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,610
know of him and Alyssa Miller and when

71
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,410
I'm not doing that I run at a hacker

72
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,140
book club that meets every Tuesday at

73
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,459
5:00 p.m. and right now we are covering

74
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,910
connected cars from Allison night so

75
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,739
yeah so every month we read a book that

76
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,840
was written by a hacker in the commune

77
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,640
and the hacker commutes up it's a lot of

78
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,470
fun and they actually have the author's

79
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,350
joined us feel free to follow me on

80
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,400
Twitter and Instagram

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,290
I just went back on Instagram recently

82
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,799
so feel free to so I'm going to tell you

83
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,880
a little bit about what we're going to

84
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,220
be doing today so

85
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,660
the agenda is the following we're gonna

86
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,980
dive a little bit into the current

87
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,340
landscape also why so scared in other

88
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,010
words why is everyone scared and then

89
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,980
how we can influence the public the role

90
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,290
that media arts and legislation plays

91
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,238
and then some next steps and yes that is

92
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:25,160
Sherlock oh hold on one sec all right so

93
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,290
the current landscape let's just first

94
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,560
talk about Equifax okay I'm creatures

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,900
for some of you guys it impacted you at

96
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,990
a certain point or someone was impacted

97
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,640
by it but overall six months before it

98
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,950
came out in the news of the breach it

99
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,750
was actually secured researcher that

100
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,040
notified the company about the

101
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,920
vulnerability but Equifax team Patchett

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,290
only after the massive breach made

103
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:57,050
headlines that's when they did and then

104
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,290
we have Capital One case so basically

105
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,120
what happened was that according to the

106
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,680
federal complaint this breach took place

107
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,590
in stages across March and April 2019

108
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,020
but Capital One only became aware the

109
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,169
problem on July 17th when a security

110
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:13,880
researcher tipped the company to a

111
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,740
public github page that was displaying

112
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,540
something that looked awfully like

113
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,250
private capital one data but let's be

114
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,140
honest what happened if no one actually

115
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,270
reported it and you might find that

116
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,490
person in the corner familiar that's to

117
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,380
meet Eleazar Ishii was kind of like the

118
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,290
first person that really got me

119
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,000
interested in knowing about safe harbor

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,280
but also about the data that she

121
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,350
collected about security researchers and

122
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,370
why they weren't reporting

123
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,060
vulnerabilities and honestly the reason

124
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,060
60 percent don't report models is this

125
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,780
fear of being prosecuted so we're gonna

126
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,650
talk a little bit about that so why are

127
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,730
hackers scared

128
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,050
besides prosecution that's and you know

129
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,910
looking for contact information reading

130
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,310
policies have been a burnin troop

131
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,120
Bonz and this is one of those cases and

132
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,150
I'd love to talk about this one for

133
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,090
example if you might know DJI but they

134
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,330
do drones and so they decided they

135
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,650
wanted to create their own bug bounty

136
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,640
program and when they did they they

137
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,690
didn't really know what they were doing

138
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,350
either so basically what happened was

139
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,730
this person that you see on the screen

140
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,670
Kevin Kevin basically message them

141
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,150
asking to confirm the scope and it took

142
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,340
two weeks for them to respawn and when

143
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,620
they respond he knows that the Vanar

144
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,270
really that he wants to report was

145
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,580
something within scope so he reported

146
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,550
the vulnerability and believe it or not

147
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,830
he was actually provided $30,000 for the

148
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,220
funding however the agreement of

149
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,620
receiving it the the funds offered no

150
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,020
legal protection for him so he walked

151
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:06,170
away what happened then was that believe

152
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,800
it or not

153
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,570
DJI basically were Maschine internally

154
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,880
that this guy's a threat for their PR

155
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,750
and that they need to sue him and so the

156
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,250
thing is they didn't understand was that

157
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,800
when they responded to him that was part

158
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,600
of the change that he was able to see

159
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,500
all those messages and so he did receive

160
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,380
a lawsuit tied to the Computer Fraud and

161
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,480
Abuse Act claiming that he went out of

162
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,700
scope and regardless in fact that he

163
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,830
actually made sure to confirm what was

164
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,800
the scope before reporting so at this

165
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,270
point he was like won't forget this you

166
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,740
know what I'm just gonna post everything

167
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,460
so he shared all these emails even this

168
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,040
letter on his blog post showing and

169
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,380
detailing what went down for someone who

170
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:57,950
went within scope now the thing to note

171
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,250
is is that we're in a weird situation

172
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,520
and it's a weird situation because even

173
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,830
when we are within scope but can still

174
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,530
be concerned about being prosecuted and

175
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,480
it's not just that but even though

176
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,220
government agencies are starting to

177
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,320
trust hackers by having hacked the

178
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,020
Pentagon had the army had the Navy and

179
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,449
so on the problem is that there's

180
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,460
legislation changes that have happened

181
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,699
yet that actually supports ethical

182
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:28,430
hackers but also there's a lot of

183
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,990
companies out there that are really

184
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,479
afraid of doing a vulnerability

185
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,639
disclosure program or even putting down

186
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,889
their contact information for someone to

187
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,839
report vulnerability because they just

188
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,870
they're scared so the big takeaway on

189
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,019
this is that everyone is scared

190
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,100
organizations are scared of hackers

191
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,769
reporting anything

192
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:50,300
government is scared of hackers because

193
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,029
they might do something and overall it's

194
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,880
it's kind of sad because we are in this

195
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,160
situation basically driven by fear and

196
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,860
nothing's changing because it's fear so

197
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,970
we're going to dive a little bit into

198
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,070
this fear base and why is that but I

199
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,350
know this is a scary subject so here's

200
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,870
some puppies to lift your spirit and I

201
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,850
did place a cap for cat lovers as well

202
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,889
you know because we need a practice

203
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,720
inclusion can you spot the cat I know

204
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,699
it's a little tricky sometimes

205
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:27,800
all right next slide so I want to talk

206
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,930
about a little bit about how do we

207
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,690
process this fear well if you see over

208
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,130
here ethical hackers are not malicious

209
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,170
actors yet they're being seen in truth

210
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,380
as such and because of this it reduces

211
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,540
the chance of report of raw ability and

212
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,250
can cause hackers to go to the dark side

213
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,250
because they're seen as the same so to

214
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,019
the left is what you see when typing in

215
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,730
criminal hackers and to the right is

216
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,769
what you see when you type in ethical

217
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:57,680
hackers once again hoody and darkness

218
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,529
and it doesn't just stop there at the

219
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:04,190
imagery it's also the language use in

220
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,769
the media so when I say media remember

221
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:10,339
it's marketing and press so we're also

222
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,410
dealing with the situation with certain

223
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,069
words are being used and also images of

224
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:19,310
of what a hacker looks like and now

225
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,029
these are not correct so how does this

226
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,370
imagery and language impact us well

227
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,139
first of all it does continue to feed

228
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:29,630
the fear and the stereotypes and biases

229
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,470
that exist through social construction

230
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,380
but really how does that work so we're

231
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,000
gonna dive a little bit quickly on your

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,010
brain and for those that know and see my

233
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,690
talks I usually always mention the brain

234
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,230
because I'm obsessed with it um and also

235
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,490
it's good to know if you're a social

236
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,740
engineer alright so I want you to look

237
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,590
at this lovely diagram here and I want

238
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,110
you to focus on my green shade area the

239
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,910
temporal lobe so the temporal lobe is

240
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,940
where you basically stem your memories

241
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,130
your emotions are connected to these

242
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,890
memories these visual cues but also

243
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,020
within the temporal lobe it is the

244
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,210
hippocampus and amygdala them so the

245
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,390
hippocampus takes in short-term memories

246
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,460
and makes it long-term memories and your

247
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,470
amygdala is a fight versus flight

248
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,770
mechanism now the amygdala is one that

249
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,240
is really important to understand

250
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,070
because that is where your emotions are

251
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,080
usually controlled and is usually

252
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,840
subconscious so the amygdala is an

253
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,400
almond-shaped section of the nervous

254
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,260
tissue located in the temporal side lobe

255
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,790
of the brain which is responsible for

256
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,260
your emotion survival instincts and

257
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,750
memories but just note that you cannot

258
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,490
control it because this is completely

259
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,270
subconscious only the prefrontal can so

260
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,650
I want to talk a little bit about how

261
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,010
does this work well think about it this

262
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,120
way you see an image of someone with

263
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,340
pink hair and I'm sorry if you have pink

264
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,550
hair

265
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,870
there's nothing guess you having pink

266
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,430
hair it's just as an example I tend to

267
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,900
use so imagine you see somewhat pink

268
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,920
hair now I want you to think of say for

269
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,170
example when you were a little kid you

270
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,360
had a teacher and a dolt even in the

271
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,700
news and the media you saw that people

272
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,770
with kink hair are dangerous individuals

273
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,690
they steal they do all these terrible

274
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,170
things and so now you're been programmed

275
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,870
basically to fearless this is what's

276
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,850
called a socially constructed belief

277
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,100
it's something that we've been told and

278
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,490
we now are programmed in our brain that

279
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,060
that is the way life works so what

280
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,800
happens is that when you do see someone

281
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,320
pink hair you might you know hold your

282
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,910
bag a little bit closer to you might

283
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,620
cross the street to avoid the person

284
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,330
won't care because you think that they

285
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,810
are a huge threat so what do you think

286
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,270
about this the personal impede care

287
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,250
that's how other people are seeing

288
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,779
hackers when they find out that their

289
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:52,089
hackers they're really scared I don't

290
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:53,560
know if you noticed but anytime you say

291
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,390
I am a hacker or I work with hackers

292
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,420
usually the other party their eyes bulge

293
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,820
out a little bit they take a step back

294
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,550
their mouth might drop I mean it's very

295
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,560
awkward suddenly because now they're

296
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,910
like I don't know if I can trust you

297
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,430
aren't you a criminal then so it's very

298
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,560
interesting to deal with that but the

299
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,899
thing is is that the main takeaway is

300
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,520
that socially constructive beliefs can

301
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,190
always be challenged so if you go to the

302
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,770
pink side of the brains on the left side

303
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,660
right there the frontal lobe I want you

304
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,700
to pay attention to that that is where

305
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,310
the prefrontal cortex plays so basically

306
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,580
when someone sees a threat the amygdala

307
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,440
sends a message to the prefrontal cortex

308
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,110
of your brain alerting it warning

309
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,529
warning person is near you who is

310
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:42,459
dangerous so are you going to act on

311
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,589
this and so the prefrontal cortex of

312
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,450
your brain acts like the CEO it tells it

313
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,310
whether or not it can keep going forward

314
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,640
with the threat or to reduce it so the

315
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,770
good news is that like I said socially

316
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,690
constructed beliefs can always be

317
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,020
questioned and so what basically what we

318
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,750
need to do is try to convince the public

319
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,630
to understand that we are no longer a

320
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,779
threat but we're there as you know the

321
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,839
everyday super ear protecting them so

322
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:13,149
now the rest of the conversation I want

323
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:15,850
to have is how do we go about doing that

324
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,730
how do we change public opinion because

325
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,890
right now we are in a situation that

326
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,450
needs to change immediately because

327
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,270
what's happened is that 93% of Forbes

328
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,010
Global 2000 still don't have a

329
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,220
vulnerability disclosure policy 60% of

330
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,810
hackers do not report any

331
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,180
vulnerabilities and that's usually out

332
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,339
of fear of prosecution and laws that

333
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:42,690
prevent good hacking like CFA and DMCA

334
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,060
those things exist and we are still

335
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,670
prosecuting ethical hackers which is the

336
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,200
saddest part because even if they're

337
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,610
within scope they still have to be

338
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,709
concerned about this and being alive

339
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,860
with insomnia - and last night at least

340
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,779
this is

341
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,040
increasing the number of malicious

342
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,660
hackers and I don't like seeing

343
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,600
malicious hackers I would just say

344
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,019
blackhat actors or attackers but overall

345
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,209
what I you're probably actually

346
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,980
wondering about that whole thing about

347
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,779
how does that increase the number well

348
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,939
let me tell you from interviewing

349
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:16,589
blackhat hackers one of the reasons they

350
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,569
decide to move away from ethical hacking

351
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,089
is the pay and that constant worry of

352
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:22,949
being prosecuted regardless if they did

353
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,959
something legal this is also said

354
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,730
similarly for those that switch from

355
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,649
being a black hat hacker to ethical

356
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,420
hacker the reason they switch was the

357
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,939
insomnia of being arrested because there

358
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:34,980
are cases when organizations prosecute

359
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,660
ethical hackers regardless if they were

360
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,490
in scope so that is why we're still

361
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,819
dealing with that today but an overall I

362
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,559
want to take away from this slide is

363
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,779
it's the mindset set by society by

364
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,490
people in the media that's keeping us

365
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,470
unsafe and preventing hackers what they

366
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,100
do well so now I want to talk a little

367
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,170
bit about worldwide legislation you can

368
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,199
find this in every country pretty much

369
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,569
and yes this is us-centric the CFA and

370
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:04,259
DMCA but just note that those two you

371
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,269
can find in your own country is also if

372
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,009
you're in Canada I guess what it's not

373
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,149
called the Digital Millennium Copyright

374
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:10,970
Act it's just called the Copyright Act

375
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,350
but let me talk a little bit about these

376
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,740
so what exactly is a anti-hacking law

377
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,949
well anti-hacking law is basically a law

378
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:21,389
that prohibits accessing a computer

379
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:24,269
without authorization or in excess of

380
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:26,339
authorization and this is usually used

381
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,689
when the researcher goes out of scope

382
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,790
this is the act used to prosecute

383
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,370
hacking a really cool fact that I

384
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,889
actually found out from Casey Ellis who

385
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:37,920
did my wonderful intro he basically you

386
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,199
shared with me that one of the things is

387
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,529
that the CFA came about because Ronald

388
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:45,870
Reagan and watchful wargames and he

389
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,370
basically kind of freaked out it was

390
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,929
like we gotta do something about these

391
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:50,339
hackers they're gonna do terrible things

392
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,079
to us so yeah it's a great fact you know

393
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,699
now what is the anti-circumvention law

394
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,769
so anti-circumvention laws are basically

395
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,870
the rights repair so reverse engineering

396
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,519
is seen as a breach of property to some

397
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,109
companies now who here in a room has

398
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,730
ever

399
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,890
the turns and condition for an apple

400
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,179
product yeah I'm thinking crickets right

401
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:16,669
now because let's be real I tried I got

402
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,530
bored I decided to watch a movie instead

403
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,069
it probably was wargames but in general

404
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,869
they could be long and too much verbage

405
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,939
it can confuse anyone specially English

406
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:27,679
is not their first language this can

407
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,390
lead to some serious miscommunication

408
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,190
issues for ethical hackers that don't

409
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,160
really speak English but overall I want

410
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,720
the main takeaway to be from the slide

411
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,850
is that clearly these laws are old and

412
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,799
out-of-date and honestly were created

413
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,380
out of fear not empathy by taking the

414
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,150
time to understand what is needed and

415
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,480
why law should only prosecute malicious

416
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,340
actors aka criminals and not good

417
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,650
hackers overall there are laws out there

418
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,840
right now and the laws are preventing

419
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,130
good hack in the same way that they're

420
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,960
preventing bad hacking and we need good

421
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,090
hacking so how are we gonna do that

422
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,980
remember I was talking about the brain

423
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,360
that we need to change things yeah

424
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,370
because what we really need right away

425
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,500
is improvements to legislation because

426
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,210
with improvements to legislation we can

427
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,730
change the previous slide but in order

428
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,080
to do that we must dive into three

429
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,270
categories in which we kind of touched

430
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,100
on because we need to work together to

431
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,710
bring about public change so how do we

432
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,090
influence the public well that is the

433
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,640
question that everyone has but in order

434
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,500
to have rights for hackers we need to

435
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,440
get the public on board in order to do

436
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,970
so we need to dive into three categories

437
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,179
organization media legislation you need

438
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,980
the press to push for public to become

439
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,750
aware in other words we need to change

440
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,460
the language and imagery of a hacker and

441
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,380
start to use cyber criminals for those

442
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,960
that commit unethical hacking overall

443
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,520
really separate the two and I tend to do

444
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,110
this office so if I see someone on

445
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,480
LinkedIn post something about hackers

446
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,280
and when they really mean cyber

447
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,740
criminals I do correct them and you

448
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,630
should do it too because it's fun and

449
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,120
that's the only way we're gonna learn

450
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,610
also in order to help the press we need

451
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,890
organizations to get on board with

452
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,570
bilateral trust with having

453
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,320
vulnerability disclosure programs

454
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,179
that they support hackers the public

455
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:24,669
changes their view in general and if you

456
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:26,139
want what are organizations these are

457
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,009
companies these are nonprofits and so on

458
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:32,649
and lastly to have organizations and

459
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,509
public opinion to push and motivate

460
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:36,730
Capitol Hill to get on board and update

461
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,049
current legislation that will protect

462
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,720
ethical hackers that is going to be the

463
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,190
hardest but the only way we're going to

464
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,049
get legislation to change is really gain

465
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,049
the media and organizations on board so

466
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,059
we need media to report the real things

467
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,470
don't use hackers when you mean

468
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,440
attackers we need organizations to have

469
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,149
on a really disclosure programs because

470
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:57,250
that's the only way we're gonna build

471
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,549
trust and I'll sort of prevent from them

472
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:01,750
not finding out that they have a vonner

473
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,429
Billy later down the road because some

474
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:06,429
massive breach so overall we need all

475
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:10,690
three of these to have hacker rights so

476
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,570
the five needs is we just overall need a

477
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,220
push for awareness about the climbers

478
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,210
and the five needs here is how how we

479
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,860
could get there these are the things we

480
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,049
need to make sure we do so the first

481
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,179
step together is I created this petition

482
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:30,519
at the end of February and it's broken

483
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,230
down into three different parts so

484
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,409
basically what we talked about today for

485
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,450
organizations I'm asking for them when

486
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,860
they sign this that they implement

487
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,690
policies that clearly define What's in

488
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,029
scope if any what kind of rewards

489
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:45,639
contact information I don't know about

490
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:47,889
you but sometimes it takes hours days

491
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:49,659
weeks to find someone's contact

492
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:51,129
information when you want to report

493
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:52,509
something and then you get to the point

494
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,639
where it's like should I should I take

495
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:58,720
this risk still also having communicate

496
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,580
updates on the submission I know many of

497
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,679
you guys I do bug daddy sometimes it it

498
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,269
drives me up the wall but you're like so

499
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:06,070
how they fixed it what's going on what's

500
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,629
going on with the submission I want to

501
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:10,629
know so I feel the only updates will be

502
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:12,759
great I also have an extension of

503
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,379
bilateral trust to include non

504
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:16,840
retribution which is the most important

505
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,820
thing because we need to build that

506
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,009
bilateral trust and it's gonna take both

507
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:24,730
of us to trust each other and for that I

508
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,620
really recommend checking out disclose

509
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,600
that I oh it is definitely down in the

510
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,610
notes down below on that front now

511
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,799
also asking politicians to get to know

512
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,330
ethical hackers instead of seeing them

513
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,400
as cyber criminals and to support them

514
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,559
by pushing for new legislation

515
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,460
protective additions to current

516
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,309
legislation that won't penalize them so

517
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,490
this is one of those important things

518
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,470
because we really do need politicians to

519
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,240
know more about the InfoSec community

520
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,809
because many of them don't unfortunately

521
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:57,299
and what they do is politicians watch

522
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,150
the news and so we need to change once

523
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,070
again we need press to actually report

524
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,860
differently on the imagery and the terms

525
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,650
that they use this will help us out in

526
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,740
the end and like I said we also need the

527
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,450
media to be in there so to stop

528
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,980
portraying ethical hackers as malicious

529
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,520
actors such change the imagery because

530
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,470
that's the problem because I don't know

531
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,090
about you but it's really annoying when

532
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,700
you see those cutout ski masks images

533
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,530
because the only thing that goes through

534
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,809
my mind is I have sensitive skin if I'm

535
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:29,370
wearing a ski mask I'm gonna be itching

536
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,610
like crazy underneath that and the most

537
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,590
annoying part about that is like that's

538
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,679
not gonna help me on my focusing at all

539
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,809
so it's one of those things that you

540
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,460
wish for these things to change because

541
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,080
they don't make sense also you can

542
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,280
always cover your camera on your

543
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,780
computer so you really don't need to

544
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,309
show this anymore it doesn't make sense

545
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:50,580
anyway that's enough of my rant on that

546
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,549
front but let's go into what else now

547
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:55,590
the most important thing to take away

548
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,950
from here I need you guys to do

549
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,020
something for me which is I need you

550
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,690
guys to sign this saying that you

551
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,790
promise to stay within scope and not

552
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,830
exploit yes I know there are ties are

553
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,200
you mistakenly go out of scope and

554
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,230
that's alright but just note that please

555
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,330
don't exploit because I have people

556
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,280
contacting me saying hey I found this

557
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,230
vulnerability and like next question I

558
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,260
ask is like did you exploit it and then

559
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,500
they're like yes and that's problem so

560
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,390
don't do that because that is what a

561
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,370
company you start losing trust in the

562
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,900
hacker community and that's when they're

563
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,070
like you know I'm going to take down

564
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,169
this contact information so then they

565
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:36,169
don't come and contact me anymore

566
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:39,780
to make sure to know this that when

567
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,610
Trust is broken with one of us it breaks

568
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,210
the trust with all of us and yes please

569
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,549
sign of it

570
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:49,769
so the main takeaways on this is ethical

571
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,570
hackers deserve protection rights you

572
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,850
guys deserve protection and rights

573
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,890
because what you're doing is fabulous

574
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,260
work you're protecting people you're

575
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,440
protecting a parent you're protecting

576
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,600
your kids in the future you're

577
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,000
protecting other people's kids in the

578
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,340
future you're also protecting everyone

579
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,500
right now the people that are trying to

580
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,029
make a difference in this world

581
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:14,909
they need you more than ever and all we

582
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:17,850
can ask for is for protection and rights

583
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,549
we also work together on changing the

584
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:21,990
current imagery and language that's

585
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,570
being used to mislead the public and we

586
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,740
need to work together to change the

587
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,120
public's perception by updating

588
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,149
legislation media and organizations and

589
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:31,860
lastly at least please sign and share

590
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,100
that petition is really important and

591
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,500
also check out disclosed at i/o it's

592

it's a really good thing it's you note

593
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,700
that there's a bunch of people that are

594
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,490
working together to try to showcase that

595
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,230
these companies are starting to trust

596
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,940
the hacker community more than ever

597
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,690
before

598
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,789
and those are the ones that if I were

599
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,039
you I would want to hack on to be honest

600
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,980
because I know that they they respect me

601
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,260
in other words and feel free to share in

602
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,830

want to say that change starts with you

604

605
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,799
looking at ourselves and understanding

606
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,570
what am i doing that's making the

607
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,299
situation better or worse and then

608
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,149
asking questions on how to improve it so

609
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,159
asking how can I make this better

610
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,500
is gonna be a really fundamental for us

611
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,690

this is really important to note these

627
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,070
are some really good resources for those

628
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,210
that are dealing with co19 system and I

629
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,279
know it can be really hard on mental

630
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,779
health but just note that these are

631
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,059

00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,720
actually save someone's life and I just

yourself ever it's a good note to end it

649
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,370
on thank you so much Chloe so we do have

650
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,000
a and and Sherlock potentially still

651
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:07,649
there there's like give me some food so

652
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:09,090
a question that came in out so how do we

653
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,100
make positive changes to legislation and

654
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,190
what can we do to improve education

655
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,220
among decision makers this is a good

656
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,820
question

657
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,070
so one thing is that I've been trying to

658
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,929
do is talking with politicians to see

659
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:24,389
how can we change this and really it's

660
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:26,100
more of all of us pushing out there

661
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,389
we're talking to our friends and our

662
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:29,639
family people outside of InfoSec because

663
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:31,440
this is never gonna go or like

664
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,570
politicians are not gonna pay attention

665
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,039
if we just talk about this in the

666
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,509
community we need to go outside the

667
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:38,549
community so having those conversations

668
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:41,460
at your work having these conversations

669
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,179
with your friends family it's gonna be

670
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,889
really important because we need all

671
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:49,259
people to participate in this because

672
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:50,940
there's not too many people in the

673
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,559
InfoSec community so it's hard to get

674
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,820
that message across to so yes and then

675
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,570
also on the the petition itself you

676
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,059
actually every time that it's sent it

677
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,279
goes to certain assembly members as well

678
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,039
so that's the good news

679
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,710
the other thing is that once I get

680
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,929
a thousand signatures I can definitely

681
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:13,700
push or what changes are used to work in

682
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,950
politics so when you get a thousand

683
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,600
signatures then you get more people's

684
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,640
attention you get to you like go visit

685
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,500
the Congress people and their offices

686
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,649
are you guys some virtual meetings but

687
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:26,120
that's the one thing is that we need

688
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,130
more and more people sign this and we

689
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,230
need more organizations to know about it

690
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,909
then we can get it going but the

691
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:33,289
petition is definitely the first step

692
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:35,779
that's awesome that's awesome I would

693
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:38,360
add to that that you know as some of the

694
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,830
some of the work that's our eye on the

695
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,590
cavalry are doing so you know Bo and and

696
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,470
those folk in DC especially the hackers

697
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,240
on the hill initiative basically what

698
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,039
they do not sure what the plan is for

699
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,559
the superior Wesley because DEFCON is

700
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,320
cancelled just got canceled and it's now

701
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,679
actually canceled for real I just

702
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,130
confused myself with that they get out

703
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,600
they get it and get out there and and do

704
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,490
basically planned meetings with with

705
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,029
local state representatives from from

706
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:13,340
the house and they go through basically

707
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,020
a primer on like how to Capitol Hill

708
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,590
good as the hacker and really the idea

709
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,120
of that is for it to be accessible to

710
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,380
anyone like you shouldn't necessarily

711
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,570
need to be a you know a seasoned

712
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,980
political activist or someone who

713
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,539
understands constitutional law to be

714
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,010
able to make an impact in this like if

715
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,140
you're a citizen of a country that's

716
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,730
thinking about this stuff you know we're

717
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,809
talking a lot about America right now

718
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:39,260
but this applies everywhere legislation

719
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,179
other countries will follow that's

720
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,340
usually how it goes is one country takes

721
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,960
the initiative and then it puts pressure

722
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,200
on other countries just need one country

723
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,820
to care about us that is all it'll take

724
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,220
to showcase that there are people

725
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,309
listening and I guess on a capital hell

726
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:59,690
if you're in the US or another I don't

727
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,600
know other Hills in other countries

728
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,070
there are other Hills so maybe we should

729
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,110
try to take those as well maybe we we

730
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,700
can turn this into a giant kind of

731
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,669
capture the flag of which group of

732
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:12,409
hackers can be the first to can it's the

733
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,860
country to jump in the path as a closing

734
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,710
on so thank you so much Chloe and Luke

735
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,340
I'll hand it off to you

736
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:33,789
