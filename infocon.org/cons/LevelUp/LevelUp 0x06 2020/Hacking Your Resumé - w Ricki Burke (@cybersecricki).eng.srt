[Music]

2
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:13,860
on that note I think we move to the next

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,890
talk it's more about things like how to

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,859
get a damn job it's pretty awesome we're

enjoyed that and so you've given me

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,660
something to try and follow up with this

33
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,380
oh no pressure

34
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,610

asking me to do this hack your resume so

36
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,690
hopefully very relevant to try and

37
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,930
leveling up the people's careers

38
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,199
so probably SML thank you for the

39
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:23,940
introduction and recruitment company sub

40
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,770
security recruitment we support

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,230
customers across a pack and now starting

42
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,650
to look at the US as well I do like to

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,700
be involved in the community I'm

44
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,620
extremely passionate about this industry

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,930
I love it and I'm very fortunate to be

46
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,310
involved in quite a few different things

47
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,530
from talking at besides events to

48
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,410
running a mentoring program with co

49
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,560
dingo running the meet up with prod GES

50
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,780
ml and lots of other cool things it's

51
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,600
just an amazing industry to be in and

52
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,190
hopefully I can share some stuff along

53
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,310
the way that I pick up on a daily basis

54
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,709
talking to leaders out there and also

55
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,900
just stuff we see in process to help

56
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,100
help people out with their careers so we

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,940
put together some simulated jobs what

58
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,590
we'll do is run through some feedback

59
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,519
based on what we saw the good the bad &

60
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,019
etc I reach out to quite a number of

61
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,410
CEOs and hiring managers to ask them

62
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,240
their feedback these these are the guys

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,980
and girls that are actually reviewing

64
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,770
the Seabees hiring people and so I have

65
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,110
an opinion based on someone who sees a

66
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,540
lot of profiles and CVS but also I

67
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,160
wanted to share their feedback on the

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,200
actual hiring managers themselves so

69
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,730
hopefully we're gonna help you level up

70
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,160
your application so I dropped the the

71
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,140
name there as well and then show you an

72
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,480
example CV that we thought I put

73
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,460
together as well that I think if I saw

74
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,170
it I would appreciate it massively all

75
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,900
right so fake jobs

76
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,340
simulated jobs we put together three

77
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,590
roles so junior suck analyst a

78
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,000
penetration tester and security engineer

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,680
these are the results from those

80
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,630
applications and I just say first of all

81
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,580
thank you so much to all the people that

82
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,400
took the time to do that and so you

83
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,320
certainly didn't have to participate in

84
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,549
this process this will

85
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,660
I think more thing that myself and the

86
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,610
guys in bugcrowd were hoping for and it

87
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,440
came off so thank you to everyone that

88
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,940
basically put some time in to help us

89
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,480
out and hopefully help you out as well

90
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,370
so there's definitely some mixture of

91
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,050
profiles some good ones and ones that

92
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,760
need improving and that's what this is

93
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,290
all about so this is where the profiles

94
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,180
or the applications actually went so we

95
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,820
saw for me not surprisingly the vast

96
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,980
majority going to the pen testing role

97
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,890
what was surprising is that it was only

98
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,230
47% normally when we have these

99
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,180
conversations particularly Co dingo and

100
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,090
i it feels like 90 plus percent of

101
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,550
people actually want to be a pen tester

102
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,570
so is interesting to see more of a

103
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,300
balance there but again not too

104
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,680
surprising that majority are interesting

105
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,750
so this is for those people that didn't

106
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,340
go through this process this is what you

107
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,050
come across you followed a link and then

108
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,640
you came across this mock job

109
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,890
description so the typical sort of thing

110
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,450
you would see if you're applying for a

111
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,630
role on line so roles responsibilities

112
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,810
requirements and desirable skills put

113
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,820
your details in and upload your CV and

114
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,550
where you go and again thank you to the

115
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,380
I think it's plus 50 people that

116
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,960
participate it says awesome now this

117
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,980
small thing here this area the cover

118
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,550
letter or free free type this me

119
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,879
e is Mastiff and it was more but Ethel

120
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,810
when their boy for all they have the

121
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,360
opportunity to basically upload

122
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,129
something so a cover letter something

123
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,819
accompanying your profile this is the

124
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,909
percentage of people that did do a cover

125
00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:02,360
letter so 35% so honestly well done to

126
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,509
those people that did so the first

127
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,970
reason why I ilanic come letter and

128
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,379
maybe it's a bit of an old school thing

129
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,090
but um thing is because it's your first

130
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,310
opportunity to make an impression it's

131
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,330
the first opportunity to really

132
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,400
highlight your skills and you can

133
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,460
actually tailor it to the role so a lot

134
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,409
of people have a generic CV that they'll

135
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:26,419
attach to every single job application

136
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,569
but with a cover letter you can make it

137
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:30,650
personalized you can tailor your

138
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,370
approach so this is an example of one of

139
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,199
those cover letters that we receive so

140
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,580
I've highlighted in yellow so this was a

141
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,199
cover letter for one of the engineering

142
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,469
roles or the engineering role and the

143
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,389
yellow bits there they've specifically

144
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,750
highlight at least the first paragraph

145
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,460
information that relates to the role so

146
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,130
the smart thing to do is to look at the

147
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,840
job description and those key

148
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,729
experiences those key requirements if

149
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,550
you can then show that in the cover

150
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,860
letter the person very quickly going to

151
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,419
identify you actually have some written

152
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:12,889
skills I'm gonna keep reading I want to

153
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:14,840
get to know this person and the other

154
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,159
things I've highlighted it's down below

155
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,900
and yellow volunteering and

156
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,599
communication presentation skills

157
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,479
whether we like it or not most roles in

158
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,430
IT and security these days they do

159
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,710
require communication skills they need

160
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,380
you to communicate internally externally

161
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,810
or whoever it is so even if you're and

162
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,479
again relating to a raised last talk

163
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,440
about the reports you know the quality

164
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,349
of a report matters whatever you're

165
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:43,819
doing and then also the volunteering

166
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:46,460
people like people contributing back to

167
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,080
the community

168
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,599
Oh cover letter first impression you can

169
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,129
gain a competitive advantage

170
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:59,479
so those a 35% of people it did add the

171
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,030
cover letter they then had the chance to

172
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,830
make a first impression and also tell

173
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,060
the reader again why they're relevant

174
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,979
for the role what skills they have and

175
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:10,990
that is without the other people the 65%

176
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,580
having had the opportunity to even get

177
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,039
to know them yet so help you still stand

178
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:18,710
out and again as somebody who received a

179
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,750
lot of profiles and stuff like that I

180
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,969
really recommend it so an interesting

181
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,889
question and I've done some research on

182
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:30,680
this and thanks google how long do we

183
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,149
actually have when it comes to reviewing

184
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:36,260
CDs so apparently according to Google

185
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,649
it's between 6 and 8 seconds

186
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:41,570
that's how long people CDs are reviewed

187
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,360
for I'm surprised if it's that short but

188
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,160
I wouldn't be surprised if it's much

189
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,450
longer maybe 30 seconds or maximum 60 so

190
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,980
really you need to capture someone's

191
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,470
interest their imagination the quick you

192
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,699
can do that again they're going to read

193
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:57,220
on they're gonna want to get to know you

194
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,880
and how many pages should a CV be so

195
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,500
this is the result from those

196
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,839
applications that we had so over 10

197
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,459
percent of those were four pages plus

198
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:10,399
nearly 40% with three pages and as we

199
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,690
can see one and two pages around 50%

200
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,420
based on all the conversations I have I

201
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,279
think maximum should be around two pages

202
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,949
and if you are quite junior or not

203
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,110
experienced then you don't need more

204
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,949
than a page and I have seen once I did

205
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:29,810
see a white paper that was 120 pages

206
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,500
long so come and use that as their CV no

207
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,930
one is going to read this stuff think of

208
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,550
a series of gateways your personal

209
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,589
marketing material you just wants to

210
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,420
capture someone's interests enough to

211
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,709
show the air you can do the role and

212
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,029
they want to get to know you better

213
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:46,339
they can dig into the details in terms

214
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,260
of the technicals and stuff like that in

215
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,220
the interview itself

216
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,339
and one person did attach a file that we

217
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:57,790
couldn't even read so yeah at least

218
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,819
attach a profile or a version through

219
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:03,879
that someone can actually assess so if

220
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,740
someone has to take extra steps to try

221
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,449
and read your CV then again if you're

222
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:11,410
one of X number of applications you want

223
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,970
to save some time make it easy for the

224
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,189
reader they don't have to go through

225
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:16,689
extra things or download anything else

226
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:20,139
to actually read your CV and I'm glad to

227
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:22,389
say I didn't see this on these CDs but I

228
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,279
have seen people put passport

229
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,559
information even their family's passport

230
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,920
details and things like that on a CV

231
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,740
which is just ridiculous and these are

232
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,629
people working in security as well so

233
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,490
obviously you don't need that stuff most

234
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,870
people probably this wouldn't do that

235
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,459
but there are people in the world that

236
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:42,249
would do this crazy stuff also you don't

237
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:43,540
need your date of birth you don't even

238
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,949
need but some people still put their

239
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:47,110
address you don't need that put your

240
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,629
nearest city or put your suburb you

241
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,309
don't need to reveal that much personal

242
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:52,990
information but at least maybe show

243
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:59,350
location this is part of so on simon cv

244
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,389
i've always recommend having a summer

245
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:04,120
ring so some people jump straight into

246
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,309
having their experience I think have you

247
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,769
your name etc and then have you like a

248
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,809
profile summary about yourself again

249
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,939
this could be an a version of a cover

250
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:16,509
letter but it's a very short way to tell

251
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,730
someone who you are what you're about to

252
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,170
what experience you have and why you're

253
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,360
right for this for this role and this

254
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,860
person for me I've really enjoyed

255
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,250
reading the first part the second part

256
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,069
no offence if you're seeing this but you

257
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:31,269
can do a few tweaks and you have a

258
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:33,309
really good cover letter but the first

259
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,350
part I loved it gives us an insight in

260
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,970
terms of why security and I think a lot

261
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,870
of people can relate to

262
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,269
they got hacked and this shows that

263
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,589
they've got a curious nature they've

264
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:45,189
picked up some technical skills I can't

265
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:47,139
see why a hiring manager would not like

266
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,749
this information here it's a good story

267
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:51,610
the second part of highlights here not

268
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,279
so good this is my opinion but again my

269
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,839
opinions based on the many conversations

270
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,290
I have with hiring managers so I'm three

271
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,879
times faster than a normal person and

272
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,500
thinking more

273
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,810
people want they want systemic skilled

274
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,910
people they want smart people but they

275
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,320
also want people that also humble as

276
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,900
well you know if you're claiming to be

277
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,730
the smartest person in the room the

278
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,800
fastest person in the room the the most

279
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,930
technical person or whatever it is then

280
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,000
you better back it up and if you can't

281
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,110
back it up then you can only look like

282
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,130
an idiot and even if you can back it up

283
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,420
you're not really showing that you're

284
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,580
the most humble person and more more

285
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,350
companies these days out there they're

286
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,450
they're not looking for yes they're on

287
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,340
the technical person but also want a

288
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,020
team player so unless you're hiring a

289
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,140
freelancer who's coming just to do a a

290
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,850
test or something and a very specific

291
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,290
piece of projects they're going to come

292
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,780
and go but if you're looking for a job a

293
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,920
role with a company they want people

294
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,480
that are going to be part of a team part

295
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,390
of a culture and a lot of companies talk

296
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,400
about the no [ __ ] policy and it's

297
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,710
yeah it's true for Sony comes I speak

298
00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:00,770
with so I spoke to a lot of ceased

299
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,860
social and hiring managers on a clay 'td

300
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,210
collect a lot of the information shared

301
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,010
their bullet points and a way out what I

302
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,990
did ask them was what are your top three

303
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,500
to five

304
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,350
and tips on hiring reviewing CVS and

305
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,640
things like this so I've managed to put

306
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,910
a lot of information together and again

307
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,100
is stuff I know but it's nice to see it

308
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,380
reiterated through these senior people

309
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,940
that are hiring and reviewing people on

310
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,420
a daily basis so that first point an

311
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,580
icebreaker yes it is it's nice break

312
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,710
it's make your first impression make it

313
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,140
count and that's where again having a

314
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,970
good cover letter having a really good

315
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,000
profile summary is massive so you're

316
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,890
gonna help yourself stand out and again

317
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,500
when you've only got maybe let's pretend

318
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,630
it is six seconds let's pretend is 60

319
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,950
seconds whatever it is you've got a

320
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,960
small amount of time to make that first

321
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,910
impression and make a positive positive

322
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,750
one as well

323
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,370
you know you don't want to keep the real

324
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,500
juicy information there's the stuff that

325
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,350
they need to know about down the page -

326
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,200
or down at the bottom so make it

327
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,270
relevant and make it stand out as quick

328
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,350
as possible

329
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,470
most of those hiring managers said the

330
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,180
same thing no spelling errors so yeah

331
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,680
simple as it is we've got all these

332
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,240
tools and stuff for these days and it's

333
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,830
easy to make mistakes and run things

334
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,350
quickly but you know whether you're

335
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,120
using grammarly whether you're doing

336
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,170
spellcheck whether you're getting

337
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,120
someone else to read it do something no

338
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,320
spelling errors there's no excuse no

339
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,060
longer Seavey's no one's got time for

340
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,200
that so no one's gonna read a CV that's

341
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,360
word-for-word eight ten twelve pages

342
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,660
long I love this comment here so don't

343
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,120
have lots of words beautiful words best

344
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,430
words so that was someone quoting

345
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:50,260
process there yes true and again get to

346
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,380
the point and the last one and I did

347
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,970
this I run a workshop a few weeks ago

348
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,150
for another conference and did the same

349
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,230
sort of thing asked lots of hiring

350
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,880
managers about the things and one of the

351
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,350
things they always wanted to see was

352
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,420
outcomes so describe what was

353
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,550
accomplished you can use metrics metrics

354
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,150
fantastic but you want outcomes you know

355
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,680
where you can show you person made a

356
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,200
difference that's that's what it's about

357
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,480
because you can have the same job you

358
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,089
could some could be frog and sake a

359
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,760
penetration tester or sis sis engineer

360
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,339
or sysadmin or system engineer whatever

361
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:24,819
it is they

362
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:27,160
the same job title to three different

363
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,350
companies but the role per company can

364
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,629
differ so much so it's not about the

365
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,339
roles and responsibilities but it's

366
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,049
about what you achieved in that role so

367
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:36,519
if you can help highlight what you

368
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,679
personally did and it's going to help

369
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:42,789
you stand out more people like problem

370
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:46,089
solvers and well offensive people of so

371
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,220
offensive security people were very much

372
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,499
part of that so you know demonstrate

373
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:52,829
that for examples and experiences

374
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:55,299
someone else suggesting a CV should be

375
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:58,959
two pages this person was as is a CSO of

376
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,479
a leading company Australia and yeah

377
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,009
they got 25 years in there and they've

378
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:05,739
only got two pages so what what a short

379
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:08,739
CV also does it shows your ability to

380
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:11,289
communicate and articulate content or

381
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:13,089
information and condense it down so

382
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,649
being able to choose and cherry-pick the

383
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:17,079
right information is a skill in itself

384
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:18,699
as well so if you can do that then that

385
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:23,439
goes for you and about data dump here

386
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:27,999
too many CDs I see their 5 6 7 8 pages

387
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:30,999
long someone is experienced they've gone

388
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,399
through I don't know how many jobs in

389
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,749
their career and all they're doing is

390
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,039
every time they get a new job they're

391
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,199
just bolting on the next part they're

392
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:40,029
copying the job description or the roles

393
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:42,819
responsibilities copy and paste copy and

394
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,519
paste and then suddenly you've got lots

395
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,129
of pages and you know not enough people

396
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,109
I think when they're going for a new

397
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,999
role actually take the time to refine

398
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:54,399
this a way because information that you

399
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,489
you put it out there or you a job that

400
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:58,989
you did 10 years ago isn't as relevant

401
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:02,139
as it is now so you can you know still

402
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:04,509
have the role there but maybe just you

403
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:05,769
don't need everything you know choose

404
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:07,269
the information that's relevant for the

405
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:13,990
role that you're going for I love this

406
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,509
is so true you know even if you're

407
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,619
entry-level don't have much experience

408
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,209
you've got plenty to offer you can

409
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,519
demonstrate things so again being

410
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,250
involved in the event like this going to

411
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,830
other meetups conferences these are

412
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,480
things that should be on your CV they're

413
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,250
not enough people actually put this

414
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,350
stuff on there I helped someone out

415
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,600
recently who

416
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,710
don't give away too much improvise from

417
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,240
it let's just say they're very involved

418
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,430
in the security community and when I saw

419
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,900
their CV they weren't and they were not

420
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,390
doing themselves justice we tweaked a

421
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,090
few things and after that the CB looks

422
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,570
fantastic and again it's all about

423
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,040
information this is an information

424
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,650
sharing exercise so make sure that you

425
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,120
again you're doing yourself justice as

426
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,950
well especially if you're involved in

427
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,460
events mates helps you've had CV ease

428
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,170
published or whatever it is now this

429
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:12,110
stuff needs to be shared again spelling

430
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,510
errors please please please it can't be

431
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,120
mentioned enough check it because I see

432
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,220
too many CDs from smart people that have

433
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,190
those those issues so it's easy for me

434
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,690
to tidy up and I'll do that for people

435
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,130
when we're putting a CV forward but if

436
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,660
you're applying for role directly and

437
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,850
you haven't done that final check it's

438
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,870
gonna be there unfortunately

439
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,430
I like the last one so about tailoring

440
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,280
your approach basically so a lot of

441
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,120
people if they're desperately looking or

442
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,440
just really easily looking for role

443
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,670
they'll apply for lots of different jobs

444
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,140
and they'll not always tell you their

445
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,050
approach so you can not just tailor the

446
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,860
summary so summery but tailor the actual

447
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,680
approach itself now are you applying for

448
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,750
the right jobs the right companies have

449
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,850
you read the job descriptions are you

450
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,950
contacting the companies directly for

451
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,330
this information so you can be very

452
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,490
specific about how you do things rather

453
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,040
than a shotgun approach where people

454
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,740
will complain that applied for 50 roles

455
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,750
they've got no feedback but sometimes

456
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,740
they're not always applying for the

457
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,050
right role massive the

458
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,210
at the top so read the Job Description

459
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,910
ensure you've actually if you're

460
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,130
matching the requirements here then this

461
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,720
is your opportunity to go back to that

462
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,400
cover letter go back to that profile

463
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,440
summary and tell them you know if

464
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,780
they're looking for XYZ and you've got

465
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,130
these experiences then you can show that

466
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,650
and if someone can see that in their

467
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,530
first 15 20 seconds 30 seconds of seeing

468
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,200
a CV or the cover letter they know that

469
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,730
you're interesting for the role and

470
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,700
they'll want to get to know you did a

471
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,310
develop and sell your brand which sounds

472
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,410
like a sucky thing to say but you know

473
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,540
whether you call it brand or whatever it

474
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,610
is we've all got a reputation as such

475
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,640
and again some people might not always

476
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,920
do themselves justice they might do some

477
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,630
amazing research but they don't talk

478
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,720
about it enough and yes we know a lot of

479
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,400
people were guessing IT or security can

480
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,170
be a bit introvert and don't want to put

481
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,210
themselves out there sometimes you need

482
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,310
to you know I'm going to call you out on

483
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,820
this coding go in a positive way but if

484
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,890
it wasn't for the stuff he's done in the

485
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,710
community if it wasn't for the things

486
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,190
that he shared on his on his github and

487
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,690
the things he's been involved with I

488
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,300
don't think he'd be where he is today

489
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,440
you know it's one thing having the

490
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,450
technical skills and abilities it's

491
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,060
another thing showing that and

492
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,650
demonstrating it because if people can

493
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,720
see that that you become elevated in the

494
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,000
community it can be a crowded space if

495
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,670
you can help yourself stand out it can

496
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,280
only be good for your career networking

497
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,350
is massive maybe a bit harder to do in

498
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,360
person these days but again a lot of

499
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,470
people wouldn't be where they are in

500
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,120
their career about the networking side

501
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,110
of things so yeah like whether it's

502
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,910
online whether it's offline in the

503
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,040
future really important to build those

504
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,990
relationships and you know the the

505
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,730
people that you see today that are very

506
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,280
senior in their roles again chances are

507
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,450
they wouldn't be where they are without

508
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,820
the networks and relationships whether

509
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,320
it's mentoring whether it's advice

510
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,930
whether it's you knowing someone who

511
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,280
could actually then refer you for

512
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,370
another role there's so many ways so

513
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,110
it's one thing you know let's

514
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,940
fast-forward six months to 12 months and

515
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,190
we actually get to go to conferences

516
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,320
around the world again it's one thing

517
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,600
going to an event or a local meetup it's

518
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,870
another thing

519
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,180
talking to the people yet there because

520
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,070
you could go to 1015 meetups or

521
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,870
conferences in a year if you don't talk

522
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,850
to anyone then you're missing out these

523
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,530
opportunities because that there are

524
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,840
lots of great there's content out there

525
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,640
the thing is the content at the

526
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,170
conference is a lot of it can be watched

527
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,120
online anyway and not to say don't go

528
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,220
and see talks but don't miss out on the

529
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,140
opportunity to go and physically talk to

530
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,750
people build some relationships because

531
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,100
that you just don't know where they can

532
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,590
taking you your career you know it's

533
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,950
crazy like I ran a resume workshop at

534
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,330
besides Melbourne last year and one of

535
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,920
the guys that I met I actually end up

536
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,460
placing in a role because I just got to

537
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,620
know him and I knew he'd be immediately

538
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,929
of a really good match for one of my

539
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:17,190
customers they were looking for someone

540
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,010
more senior but I knew that he was a

541
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,510
good fit for their culture and he heard

542
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,340
of near enough of a background of what

543
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,679
they'd be looking for not only that and

544
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,260
the year before he met his now

545
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,690
girlfriend at a conference you know it's

546
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,220
just just weird like you just never know

547
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,690
how life is going to take you sometimes

548
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,920
when it comes to interviewing make sure

549
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,670
you're doing your homework

550
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,040
so research the company's research the

551
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,870
role research the people you're going to

552
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:48,360
meet because yeah again or not it's an

553
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,040
information exchange this situation here

554
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,840
and again if you can show that you are

555
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,830
someone who takes the time and you've

556
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,820
basically you've actually put the effort

557
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,250
in to show well yeah I want to get to

558
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,660
know you and you might have mutual

559
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,250
connections or you can demonstrate that

560
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,890
you know this person spoke at conference

561
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,440
X number of years ago or they built this

562
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,900
tour whatever it was then they can show

563
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,610
that you actually do care and that's

564
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,540
what people want to see as well also so

565
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,710
that someone didn't mention a thank-you

566
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,990
letter so maybe not a letter but maybe

567
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,660
email

568
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,830
rarely this happens and I've got a

569
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,300
podcast coming out on Monday where I'm

570
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,280
talking to someone in talent acquisition

571
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,980
at a big tech company and this is one of

572
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,350
the things that we discussed very very

573
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,330
minimal number of people will do it sort

574
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,610
of follow up cut thank-you email and

575
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,130
it's not a chasing email to say like

576
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,160
where's my feedback but more thanks you

577
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,840
time great to meet you just a very

578
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,490
polite thing and it's a great reminder

579
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,080
and it's courteous and it's it's just

580
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,610
again that's another thing to help you

581
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,410
stand out all these small things is

582
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,930
about giving you a competitive advantage

583
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:00,140
in your career and smile and be

584
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,750
authentic for interviews yeah at least

585
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:09,470
writing and this is goes back to doing

586
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,060
your research

587
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,560
the last part being there about a little

588
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,050
flattery so you know a personal message

589
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,750
now let's put yourself fit in a hiring

590
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,240
managers position let's pretend you you

591
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,980
did some research a few years ago that

592
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,090
went down pretty well in the community

593
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,640
or maybe you again built a tool or

594
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,070
whatever it was and someone took the

595
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,660
time to send you a message to say hey

596
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,300
such-and-such you know I applied for

597
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,800
this role looking forward to my response

598
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,990
and I'll by the way I saw this thing

599
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,460
that you built a couple years ago really

600
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,260
cool work you know thanks what you've

601
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,150
done for the community you know it might

602
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,150
sound cheesy but again it it's another

603
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,130
small thing to make you stand out and

604
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,660
hopefully in my open ups and

605
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:58,450
conversations yeah I really feel this so

606
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,880
experienced method

607
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,110
more than knowledge-based exams I get

608
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,060
this question so often what

609
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,340
certification should I take to get a job

610
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,850
and honestly I just say 4os CP which

611
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,020
I've only think guarantees you a job

612
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,850
these days but it will it will get you

613
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,580
an interview this is a competitive space

614
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,180
like it's a really weird industry where

615
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,920
if you're trying to break into it it's

616
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,140
bloody hard once you're six months into

617
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,390
it you've got a job then stuff comes to

618
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,310
you the opportunities will come to you

619
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,710
or if you're looking to change direction

620
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,300
in your careers where people might want

621
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,800
to pivot to one thing go somewhere else

622
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,050
the most important thing is learning the

623
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,630
skills so yes

624
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,930
you know it's helpful to learn

625
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,550
certifications but if I'm honest I

626
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,530
wouldn't recommend most of those because

627
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,550
I think a lot of them were a waste of

628
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,370
time and I think rather than spending

629
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,990
money on that let go and learn the

630
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,790
skills that you actually need for a job

631
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,130
itself so if you know what you want to

632
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,960
do so if you want to be a pen sess if

633
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,940
you want to be a soccer analyst you want

634
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,350
to be an architect you want to be

635
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,050
whatever it is a simple thing you can do

636
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,660
is go and talk to 10-15 people but

637
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,520
actually do the job and ask them what do

638
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,740
you do what are the skills that I should

639
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,630
use on a daily basis and then

640
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,160
reverse-engineer it learn those skills

641
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,930
and then when you're applying for these

642
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,970
roles you can then say to these hiring

643
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,680
managers in your cover letter or your

644
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,430
profile summary right now I'm a syst

645
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,440
admin but I want to become a penetration

646
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,210
tester and these the actions that I'm

647
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,800
doing about it so sort of about

648
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,320
demonstrating one that you've actually

649
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,060
got a good attitude but you're literally

650
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,010
learning these things because the closer

651
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,440
you are to basically doing the job or

652
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,170
having the skills the closer closer you

653
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,680
are to actually getting the job itself

654
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,290
so it's something I'm very very

655
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,580
passionate about to be honest because I

656
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,790
see so much wastage out there as so much

657
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,940
quite frankly [ __ ] on certifications

658
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,760
there you don't always need them I think

659
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,230
it's more important about the specific

660
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,910
skills for the job itself

661
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,940
so this is my my summary of CV advice or

662
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,820
resume advice so you need a clear

663
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,310
relevant opening make a concise make it

664
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,110
informative tell the reader who you are

665
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,770
what you're about et cetera it's all

666
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,150
about the information so this is the

667
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,070
information exchange I was talking about

668
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,500
if you can show examples if you can show

669
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,960
outcomes then that's massive show

670
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,780
business outcomes because that's what

671
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,150
business is care about you know what

672
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,030
impact did you make to an organization

673
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,560
and that can be IND in many different

674
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,320
ways you don't need along a CV once two

675
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,930
pages which is honestly I know it's hard

676
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,800
to do and I hate hate for mating see

677
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,410
bees they're they're a pain but we need

678
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,550
them it's our personal marketing

679
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,070
material and quite frankly unless you're

680
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,830
a known person and some ones are

681
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,880
approaching you for a role then you need

682
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,970
to get this done there's a couple of

683
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,570
really good tools that I've seen so novo

684
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,490
resume if I'm honest I haven't used it

685
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,350
but I've seen a few people use it and

686
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,450
the Seabees come through and I think

687
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,020
they look good

688
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,440
so yeah happy to recommend that one that

689
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,810
I've used and I'll share a CV of an

690
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,080
example that I do myself is canva

691
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,700
they've got absolutely loads of

692
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,820
templates and it's a really easy way

693
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,990
once you get your head around how to use

694
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,300
it a really great way to actually make

695
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,210
your CV stand out and please please

696
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,330
please check your grammar or at least

697
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,460
get someone else to do so it's easy to

698
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,500
do this stuff if you have the experience

699
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,540
let's pretend you're a student or let's

700
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,430
pretend you're trying to pivot from one

701
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,900
role to another and you don't have maybe

702
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,280
much experience it's relevant for the

703
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,960
role there's still plenty of stuff you

704
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,280
can do to add to your resume so there's

705
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,350
I know loads of students that have

706
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,450
landed their first job good roles in

707
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,520
pentesting companies because they've

708
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,690
done these sort of things

709
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,940
so not enough people highlight the

710
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,100
interesting stuff they've been up to so

711
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,870
whether it's you've done security

712
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,370
research whether it's your blogs that

713
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,260
you have whether it's again your github

714
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,090
account and you've contributed to loads

715
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,160
of repositories or you built some stuff

716
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,650
and put it on yourself your bug Crabb

717
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,230
profile you

718
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,550
these are things that you could be

719
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,950
putting on your CV this demonstrates

720
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,850
that your self learning the vast

721
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,530
majority and I can't even think of many

722
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,600
people but most hiring managers what

723
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,000
they want from their future employees

724
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,190
are curious people self learners people

725
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,650
with a good attitude because the reality

726
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,720
is the technology that we know now is

727
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,010
going to look very different in two or

728
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,420
three years time so the stuff that

729
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,500
you've been messing around with will

730
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,050
change and if you can show that you've

731
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,600
got experience and you've got the

732
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,730
ability to actually adapt learn and

733
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,050
you're actually passionate about this

734
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,670
stuff you're doing it yourself not

735
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,130
because your boss wants you to do or

736
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,180
because it's part of your job but

737
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,770
because you actually want to those

738
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,980
things are the differentiators a cool

739
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,320
reminder and thank you Sheeran from MD

740
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,540
SiC in the UK is about reports from CTS

741
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,240
so this is something you have to do no

742
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,590
it's not but it's another thing to help

743
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,300
you stand out so if you can demonstrate

744
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,040
let's pretend to you want to be a pen

745
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,820
tester if you can demonstrate to you

746
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,830
know if you there's a rod Lee applied

747
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,680
for a dependent testing company you sent

748
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,950
your CV and you've put one or two

749
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,060
reports in that you've put together on

750
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,540
CTF this is the thing like pen testing

751
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,740
companies they've really care about

752
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,570
technical skills and the ability to

753
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,330
articulate information this is where the

754
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,020
value is for pen testing companies and

755
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,720
their customers it's the report if you

756
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,950
can demonstrate you've got the skills

757
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,810
and ability to do that then again you're

758
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,100
demonstrating that you're very close to

759
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,370
actually doing the job itself and if you

760
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,570
don't have much experience you don't

761
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,220
need more than a page CV so this is a

762
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,490
dummy CV that I are not get up through

763
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,800
canvas so this is me as a student

764
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:12,380
oops let's go sorry all right so I have

765
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,350
no actual experience in this CV but

766
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,080
there's a crapload of information so

767
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,890
I've got that I'm involved in the CTFs

768
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,020
at the University I'm showing some

769
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,540
technical skills that I've got I put my

770
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,990
github profile on there

771
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,450
some courses that I've been doing my

772
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,200
education conferences and meetups

773
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,269
outside of education because look

774
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:40,399
whether you're a rookie or whether

775
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,619
you're an experienced person the stuff

776
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:45,289
you do outside of your work or education

777
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:47,299
is massive and this is an not enough

778
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,009
people actually put this this

779
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:51,409
information on their resume so please

780
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,090
think about some of these things that

781
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,799
you're doing because it will help show

782
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,350
the reader how involved you are in the

783
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,889
community how seriously you take

784
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:01,999
security or the industry and how

785
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:03,889
passionate you are because if you're

786
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,690
showing that you go to these conferences

787
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,299
or meetups or whatever it is you're

788
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:10,009
actually investing your own time now

789
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:12,169
this is massive it's know you can't

790
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:14,269
determine through your company that you

791
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:17,179
work for or through the education that

792
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:20,869
you have or the university you have what

793
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:22,580
you're learning or what you're working

794
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,769
on but it's outside of work that shows

795
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:26,929
where your interests are so if you can

796
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:28,190
share that that's really valuable

797
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,769
information and again I've got a bit of

798
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:33,919
a sort of personal profile there nothing

799
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,110
too spectacular but this this would be

800
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,970
enough for me to be very interested in

801
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,289
and have a conversation with someone

802
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,940
don't lie

803
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,850
please don't liar it happens people can

804
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,570
exaggerate I've heard it happen many

805
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,700
times and you sometimes you need to call

806
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,799
people out on it sometimes people don't

807
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,600
get caught called out on it but the

808
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,870
other person will know so this is an

809
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,789
exact quote that someone sent me which I

810
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:08,580
thought I would maximize and really

811
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,240
really make a point there but I hear

812
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,380
about I've seen that this is not

813
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,789
everybody but sometimes people feel

814
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:16,259
maybe desperate maybe they feel they

815
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:18,450
need to demonstrate more than what they

816
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,149
do but companies much prefer someone

817
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:23,669
who's honest and transparent you know

818
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,070
instead of trying to exaggerate an

819
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,750
answer and make something up on the spot

820
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,009
because the reality is you're dealing

821
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,440
with some smart people out there it's

822
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,690
much better to separate I don't know but

823
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,450
I'm gonna find out that answer or how

824
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,830
would you do about it I ask a question

825
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,720
be curious because if you can show that

826
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,940
mindset it's much more appreciated

827
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,049
someone who's going to lie that it's

828
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:45,779
going to lose trust and based on that

829
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:49,460
quote I think this is relevant

830
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:02,019
and that's me so Ricky that's my handle

831
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:06,200
love it I I guess I should back up some

832
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,109
of what you're saying given our history

833
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:10,339
for context

834
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,339
I spoke to Ricky when I was looking at

835
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:14,929
transitioning to a pen tester I'd just

836
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:17,000
been told by a different recruiter hey

837
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,500
it's gonna take you five years you've

838
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,329
got to do this sensor and you've got to

839
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:23,000
do this and all of that despite having a

840
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,460
really active github despite being quite

841
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,829
well ranked in bug bounties and having

842
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:30,429
proof points that I could do the job and

843
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,839
Ricky helped me to get in front of the

844
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,389
right people and the marker the

845
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:36,770
recruiter told me it would take me to

846
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,030
get a pen tester is still in the future

847
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,339
and I'm now the global head of security

848
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:42,679
operations at bugcrowd so I really yeah

849
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,010
I mean yes sir five years so yeah they

850
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,809
told me five years to go through the

851
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:49,489
hoops of it all which was ridiculous and

852
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:51,319
to reinforce what Ricky's saying here it

853
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:53,149
was github that largely drove the

854
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:55,429
conversation when I was interviewing

855
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,960
because tools that I'd written were

856
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,790
being referenced and used by pen testers

857
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,130
on the bench so that was pretty awesome

858
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,760
but also as someone who now hires if

859
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,410
someone tells me hey I contributed to

860
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,730
this I'm gonna look at that contribution

861
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,799
which feeds back to the do not lie part

862
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:12,710
like if you come and you say hey like I

863
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,260
contributed to spider foot I go look at

864
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,089
spider foot and it's this pretty benign

865
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:18,559
thing like you know you've just put a

866
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:20,030
couple of full stops on something so you

867
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,260
could say you contributed that's

868
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,430
actually going to go against you not

869
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,609
with you so contributions matter make

870
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:28,579
sure they're quality yeah I think we've

871
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,650
got some questions James if you want to

872
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,290
jump in with that yeah so one that came

873
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,000
through from the from the discord chat

874
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,650
Ricky was what are your thoughts about

875
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,290
putting certification badge images on

876
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,869
your resume so are they distracting or

877
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:45,760
good way to draw attention or the badges

878
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,440
yeah so like yeah but I hates it to be

879
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,250
honest yeah I just thinks it's it takes

880
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,329
up unnecessary space and I do see a lot

881
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:01,730
of Seavey's where people have all the

882
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,339
letters off their name or it just looks

883
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:06,570
like a big alphabet on their CV

884
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,630
I think have a section for it I think

885
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,110
highlight the stuff but don't don't

886
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,810
don't lead with that information

887
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,400
basically you don't want people to think

888
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,200
you're just someone who's gathering

889
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,980
certifications the sake of it yeah that

890
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,850
certainly makes sense yeah if it helps

891
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,920
really great and I think it's also you

892
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,180
know you don't need certificates I

893
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,590
didn't have any certificates when I

894
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,390
became a pen tester certificates of

895
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,520
customers what you know and how you

896
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,400
prove it is to get the job you do you

897
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,080
know you you will be expected to get the

898
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,550
certificate so when they talk to a

899
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,110
customer they can say all of our people

900
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,790
are Crest certified or all of our people

901
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,280
have our CV but that's not the barrier

902
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,200
to getting the job and if there's a key

903
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,030
mistake I see people make time and time

904
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,490
again it's they spend so long prepping

905
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,530
for the OS CP and not getting started

906
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,690
and they also see that as the barrier to

907
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,950
them actually getting into the industry

908
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,170
and it's far far better to go okay I'm

909
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,700
gonna network I'm gonna go to these

910
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,750
meetups I'm going to go to these

911
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,760
conferences and start seeing where you

912
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,560
really land based on what you know so

913
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,050
you can brown yourself out better yeah I

914
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,200
agree

915
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,850
great so we're probably going to tie it

916
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,930
up there there's a heap of other

917
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,420
questions we had here we are on time so

918
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,510
Ricky will be in the discord feel free

919
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,760
to to pepper in there is always someone

920
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,190
who's got a lot to love to bring to the

921
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,170
table on this subject and really

922
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,250
exciting I think we've got time for one

923
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,470
more actually if you want to James you

924
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,720
had one more that yeah I did I was sorry

925
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,430
I was just admitting our next talk her

926
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,820
into the into the room so I might just

927
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,220
have to scroll for a moment and fill in

928
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,300
the dead air

929
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,510
I love KC's background by the way it's

930
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:04,200
been changing every top so one question

931
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,750
we do actually have though is you

932
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,340
mentioned on on personal branding

933
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,700
earlier so that would certainly be

934
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,580
related to a social media presence how

935
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,490
do you see that playing out in getting

936
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,470
and getting a role maybe your first role

937
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,190
was at a positive

938
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,200
or is it a negative thing typically or

939
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,300
how you conduct on cell phone social

940
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,819
media I guess is is the the important

941
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:29,940
point there yeah I guess you've actually

942
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,560
sort of mentioned that was there how you

943
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,450
conduct yourself because you could have

944
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,890
a presence but if you're a dick

945
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,319
then you know people will not want to

946
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:40,190
hire you but if you come across as a

947
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,960
informative and helpful person then yeah

948
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,930
of course it helps you know the thing is

949
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,599
and to be honest like this is the same

950
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,990
for me as well like I I have to put

951
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,069
myself out there a lot because I I need

952
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:57,210
competitive advantage for myself in my

953
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,280
business do I want to do it to be honest

954
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,010
not really the stuff I like doing is I

955
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,710
like being at conferences I like meeting

956
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,880
people and actually doing stuff that's

957
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,520
not I guess in the open in public forum

958
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,010
and stuff but it's good for business and

959
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,800
it's good for people personally to know

960
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,630
that I guess a number of people will not

961
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,430
just do presentations to share knowledge

962
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,500
but thing is it does enhance your career

963
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,260
because the more the people know you the

964
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,960
more people that feel like you have

965
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,920
something to offer and you have

966
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,990
something to share then it just makes

967
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,230
you more approachable you know you could

968
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,359
you could be the best at something in

969
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,920
the world but if no one knows about it

970
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,530
then no one knows about it and it's just

971
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,910
one of those things it's about awareness

972
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,240
I think

973
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:54,310
