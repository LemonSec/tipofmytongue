1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:10,730
[Music]

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,160
we're gonna move over to our next

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,570
speaker and in this case it's she is a

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,779
newcomer I don't want to [ __ ] the known

5
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,660
up no so for base a newcomer and in the

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,449
same but it not not a beginner when it

7
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,120
comes to deep deep deep studies and

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,270
knowledge it's Katy in Katy packs of

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,450
fear inside a PhD which I think she

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,600
started doing bounties back in 2019 and

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,270
being really smashing it over for the

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,420
community with the amazing content

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,070
coming out for beginners and people

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,100
there is getting into the scene so

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,610
without further ado I'm just gonna do a

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,399
little bit of explanation what the talk

17
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,530
is about because you need to do a little

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,640
presentation on that as well and so this

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,340
is what it says Katie's a PhD student in

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,439
machine learning in cyber sick during

21
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,180
her free time she's a top-notch bug

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,130
bounty hunter and cybersecurity youtuber

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,710
her talk is about something that we all

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,409
struggle with here is choosing this

25
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,009
target target and stay motivated welcome

26
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,540
Katie wow thanks thanks the introduction

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,450
I prefer occasional bug bounty hunter I

28
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:44,130
did starting 2019 um okay cool is Mike

29
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,399
can you see my slides absolutely good oh

30
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,390
great

31
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,759
cuz I don't know anything about how

32
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,290
computers work so uh my talk is called

33
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,880
sticking with that how to choose a

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,829
target and stay motivated slug me on

35
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,659
Twitter you might notice these slides

36
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,299
ever so slightly different and that's

37
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,640
because I watched the previous talk and

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,098
I was like my slides have like zero

39
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,649
buying back branding so very quickly I

40
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,530
did some quality branding so you can't

41
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:13,900
say

42
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,099
you haven't learned anything so right

43
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,590
let's talk about me if you don't know

44
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,409
who I am my name is Katie I'm called

45
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,360
inside a PhD on like Twitter and YouTube

46
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,269
but you can just call me Katie it's

47
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:30,790
shockingly enough my name I'm a PhD

48
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,319
student doing machine learning and

49
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,870
cybersecurity so that's my day job I'm

50
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,269
also a bug bounty hunter I call myself

51
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,459
an occasional bug bounty hunter doing a

52
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,500
PhD is quite intense of a job to do so I

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,599
don't have the kind of dedication that I

54
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,250
can do if I was working like an

55
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,310
all-night fight but I'm also a youtuber

56
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,230
and the new videos I make are all about

57
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,870
how to get started and specifically bug

58
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,739
bounty hunting you see a lot on youtube

59
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,930
like osep stuff and like how to get

60
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,239
certain how to do kind of pentesting

61
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,700
stuff but there's very little content

62
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,579
that's about bug hunting in particular

63
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:11,980
and I kind of noticed once you kind of

64
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,739
get like you start off oh I learn how to

65
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,680
use burp install that get it working the

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,049
knowledge saw drops off there until you

67
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,120
get to like DEFCON talks and it's like

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,970
here's how I did like three million

69
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,190
different things and how you really

70
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,409
can't do that so I wanted to kind of

71
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,900
give something in there for beginners

72
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,329
who really just want to find their first

73
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:37,449
book shockingly enough may like main

74
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,269
series is called finding your first bug

75
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,180
quality branding so if you want to check

76
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,010
out my videos they're a mixture between

77
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,109
you know specific verbs that cats like

78
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:51,250
idols or XSS or now I'm doing more

79
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,069
advanced videos like blind XSS but also

80
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,930
about kind of what you might think as

81
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,449
professional skills that are

82
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,280
specifically unique to people who want

83
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,510
to do bug bounty rather than like

84
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,180
offensive security stuff so I'm really

85
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,650
self-taught scared you have a bachelor's

86
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,150
in computer science

87
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,859
my previous experience was a data

88
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:14,859
scientist I can make some lovely graphs

89
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:17,349
but I didn't really know before I got

90
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:20,048
into security of June last year how to

91
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:24,880
find books so I should say hold my hands

92
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,530
up I don't have any formal education I

93
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,930
developer first so that's a bit about me

94
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,940
and I hope I've convinced you that I'm

95
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,040
worth listening to but if I'm if I

96
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,050
happen then the rest of the talk to go

97
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,440
so just hold on there so let's talk

98
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,990
about this talk this is the crux of my

99
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,710
talk um it's really easy and Bud bounty

100
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,870
to choose a program and then when you

101
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,870
finally do choose a program you kind of

102
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,060
get a bit seduced through you like

103
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,070
sitting there be like have I found a bug

104
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,360
in this and I've been trying for at

105
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,600
least ten minutes and then you just look

106
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,660
at the next program you're like hmmmm

107
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,919
and then you jump ship and book hunting

108
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,730
shockingly enough takes a long time you

109
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,730
won't find a bug in ten minutes or even

110
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,600
ten days it can take weeks to find a bug

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,820
in a program so you have to keep on

112
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,690
going but what I really want to cover in

113
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,660
this is motivation and giving up because

114
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,360
I'm gonna be honest with you you should

115
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,640
give up sometimes there is not a point

116
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,900
where you just keep trying and trying

117
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,370
and trying and trying trying and nothing

118
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,310
works that's just going to kill the

119
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,470
whole idea of bug bounty hunting for you

120
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,660
so in this talk I'm really gonna cover

121
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,960
these three big aspects of choosing a

122
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,120
target one is the actual process of

123
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,090
choosing a target one is motivation and

124
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,390
the final one is going to be giving up

125
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,430
and these are really quite

126
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,020
interconnected in the sense that you

127
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,080
know if you can't find a bug you feel

128
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,360
demotivated you feel demotivated you

129
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,680
want to move to something else you give

130
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,350
up and quite a lot of people might give

131
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,360
up bug bounties entirely just because

132
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,030
they feel demotivated and i guess really

133
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,850
what i want to kind of show in the talk

134
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,370
and I kind of wanna prove to you almost

135
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,070
is that there's a right time to give up

136
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,100
there's a wrong time to give up and

137
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,440
motivation is important so let's start

138
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,150
talking about motivation in particular

139
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,360
what is motivation what motivates us we

140
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,120
often use phrases like oh I feel so de

141
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,810
motivated or I feel really unmotivated

142
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,360
but actually what is motivation well

143
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,210
let's start with a question and

144
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,289
you don't actually have to provide an

145
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:43,250
answer with this because this can be

146
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,229
quite personal well I want you to think

147
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:47,539
about this idea of what motivates you

148
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,430
what are the things that you really

149
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,990
enjoy whether it's buttbounce you're

150
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,419
outside bug bounty what motivates you

151
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,360
and if you can't find an answer for that

152
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,430
question that's fine don't worry if you

153
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,319
can't find an answer yet but I want you

154
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,169
just think as I talked about this idea

155
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:05,270
of motivation I need to continue

156
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,580
thinking about motive like what

157
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,830
motivates you and I want to know if your

158
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,520
answer changes really so let's talk

159
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,199
about my favorite video this is my

160
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,270
favorite video on YouTube it was filmed

161
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,030
on a potato but it's a very very good

162
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,690
content and it's an RSA animate video so

163
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,360
this was a lecture delivered for RSA

164
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,860
that was then turned into this animated

165
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,070
video and kind of cut into bits and it's

166
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,380
cool it's by a guy called Dan pink and

167
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,000
it's called dry the surprising truth

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,550
about what motivates us now Dan pink

169
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,440
author wrote a book on this and he's got

170
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,580
like a lot of full-length lectures but I

171
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,470
think this is a good way to get into

172
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,940
kind of what he was saying he's quite

173
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,009
corporate he talks about it in terms of

174
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,110
like corporate incentives for getting

175
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,270
salespeople motivated that kind of thing

176
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,710
but I actually think it applies really

177
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,440
well to the idea of bug bounties um so

178
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,000
in case you don't want to watch it and I

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,039
just don't think it's a it's a video

180
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,740
that's quite corporate I'm gonna just

181
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,550
dilute it for you

182
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,340
so money only works as a motivator to

183
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,800
take the issue of money off the table

184
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,599
that is you get paid enough to pay your

185
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,990
rent you bills like discretionary

186
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,380
spending once you're happy shiny $2,000

187
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,930
MacBook you kind of aren't necessarily

188
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,849
motivated by money in the same way as

189
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:30,409
when you were share when you were saving

190
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,299
for that matter and you just took an

191
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,159
apples website scrolling and checking

192
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,070
out all their configuration options so

193
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,599
that's the first issue money doesn't

194
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,309
work if you don't need money and money

195
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,020
as a motivator doesn't work when you are

196
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,720
someone to do complex cognitive tasks so

197
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,190
what does that mean that means tasks

198
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,990
that involve creativity

199
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,180
it means tasks that involve multiple

200
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,430
skills

201
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,290
involves getting better at something all

202
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,050
these kind of complex ideas and wouldn't

203
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,149
you know it

204
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,580
Blood bounties are often sort of seen as

205
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,520
a kind of an easy way to get money and

206
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,710
they're often a lot of people think

207
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,350
they're easy ways to get money and I'm

208
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,930
gonna be dead honest with you right now

209
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,899
money can't be your only motivator for

210
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,270
getting into bug bounties it won't last

211
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,670
I promise you you will either get the

212
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,490
get it get your money or like your

213
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,140
income - enough of a state where you

214
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,709
don't need to make money or you kind of

215
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,510
get to an issue where you know what

216
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,670
you'd rather get a job essentially like

217
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,250
a regular nine-to-five job so it can't

218
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,510
be your only motivation for getting this

219
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,240
bug bounties it's a great reward it's

220
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,279
fantastic because when you get when you

221
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,870
spent like ten hours on something and

222
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,930
you get that a little bit of like even

223
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,560
five hundred dollars like a very small

224
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,029
amount compared to something that people

225
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:54,970
post on Twitter it shows that what you

226
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,680
found was impactful it makes you feel

227
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,779
valued makes you feel good you get all

228
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:00,670
the warm fuzzies and you're like yeah I

229
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,120
contribute to society but it's a great

230
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,690
ward terrible motivator and it's not

231
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,660
only because bug bounties are like hot

232
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,870
right they're not easy things to do like

233
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,970
a lot of people post on Twitter

234
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,190
I just got three million dollars for

235
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,640
this bug and what you don't really see

236
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,180
in that is the 3,000 hours it took of

237
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,279
hacking to get there you know you don't

238
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,959
see those man-hours if you like and what

239
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,910
bounties are hard but more importantly

240
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,670
they're like cognitively complex so this

241
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,279
is kind of the crux here money doesn't

242
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,130
work as a motivator okay Katie I believe

243
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,190
you what does please please tell me

244
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,029
because I'm getting bored so these are

245
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:52,149
our three good motivators we have

246
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,620
autonomy mastery and purpose what does

247
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,540
that mean it's all about autonomy not

248
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,510
autonomous cars because that's actually

249
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,730
the opposite of autonomy because it just

250
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,579
follows rules and when we mean autonomy

251
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,290
we mean this idea

252
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,360
being autonomous being able to work on

253
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,000
what you want when you want how you want

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,589
with who you want as long as you're

255
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,630
getting results right and this applies

256
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,850
much greater to like traditional

257
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,100
nine-to-five jobs or trishul pentesting

258
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,579
jobs where you don't necessarily get to

259
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:26,620
work on what you want or when you want

260
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,199
you have core hours or how you want you

261
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,089
got methodologies as long as you getting

262
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,720
results so maybe this doesn't apply

263
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,670
great to bug bounties but let's take it

264
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,339
from kind of a beginner sort of context

265
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:41,019
and when you're a beginner you're often

266
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,269
asking kind of a top bounty hunters

267
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,779
watch methodology how do you do it and

268
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,220
when you follow someone's strict

269
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,529
methodology the way it worked for them

270
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:53,649
not necessarily for you but for them you

271
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,569
might not feel motivated because you'll

272
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:57,610
kind of stuck to their idea of doing

273
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,930
things you're kind of stuck in this

274
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,480
regime right you'll stop doing this then

275
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,230
this then this then this but actually

276
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,389
for the most part bug penalties handle

277
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:08,980
this idea of autonomy really well

278
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,889
because you know what you can go to any

279
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:14,980
target right there's there might be like

280
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,779
different websites have different

281
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,180
customers but apart from that like you

282
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,310
don't have to just hack on one program

283
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,740
you can work when you want you don't

284
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,199
have to work 9:00 to 5:00 you couldn't

285
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,120
do whatever you like you kind of have

286
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,230
this quite a lot of autonomy already so

287
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,649
next one is purpose so the purpose is a

288
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:37,180
feeling of contributing to something

289
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,860
greater than yourself it's not this

290
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,680
purpose that is like this you love it a

291
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,449
lot needs it it's about country

292
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:47,079
something greater and but bounty kind of

293
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:48,910
examples of that is like country into

294
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,800
safety of the internet you know if you

295
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,050
use a piece of software already use an

296
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,959
app use a website and you can make that

297
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,990
safer that's a great feeling of purpose

298
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,819
of doing something for something greater

299
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:03,490
than yourself and for some people its

300
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,319
comfort me to the community like I make

301
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:08,380
videos not because I necessarily really

302
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,480
enjoy the concept of making videos I do

303
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,100
it because I want to contribute to the

304
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,779
community and that makes me feel good

305
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:15,970
and that's my purpose my reason of doing

306
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,360
things um or just leaving your mark you

307
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,810
know it's that feeling that you didn't

308
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,350
just have a 95 job and you did what you

309
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,630
were told and you went home you actually

310
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,150
did something greater you left that mark

311
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,520
on me on the security of the Internet

312
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,160
so purpose can be all these different

313
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,740
things but fundamentally it's this

314
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,279
contribution isn't greater than yourself

315
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:44,250
so that's that's autonomy and purpose I

316
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,779
talk about mastery I think mastery is

317
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,890
one of the most important ideas for bug

318
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,680
bounties and it's a feeling getting

319
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,180
better at something so it's not the

320
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,450
master for anybody interested Akhter who

321
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,040
not that kind of math so we're talking

322
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,839
about getting better at something it's

323
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,940
that incremental improvement it's the

324
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,250
improving your skills it's the knowing

325
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,110
looking back and going you know what

326
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,790
three weeks ago I couldn't do that but

327
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,880
now I can it's that feeling that's like

328
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,330
I'm getting better I can see improvement

329
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,380
you're learning and executing new

330
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,300
techniques you found a bug class you've

331
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,370
not found before you've maybe watched a

332
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,730
ton of videos on whatever idols and then

333
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,680
you've got your first Idol you can see

334
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,950
how you've gone from knowing nothing to

335
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,770
actually getting there maybe you've gone

336
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,320
from being you know know nothing to a

337
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,150
beginner to intermediate to advanced

338
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,940
it's that feeling of improvement and

339
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,580
this is knowing that you know we can

340
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,089
really lose if we don't find bugs if we

341
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:47,580
feel like we can't find them this is the

342
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,290
feeling we lose we lose that feeling of

343
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,620
I'm improving you feel it was stagnating

344
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,500
so those are the kind of three ideas of

345
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,420
motivation and so what does this all

346
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,360
tell us we need all three you know we

347
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,780
can't just have even just purpose as a

348
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,760
motivator we can't just sit there and be

349
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,290
like I want to make the internet more

350
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,480
secure because that isn't enough to get

351
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,209
us through the 30 hours of learning

352
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,910
before we're even in a position to

353
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,270
approach a target and if we lose our

354
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,950
drive in one area we kind of lose our

355
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,839
motivation we lose that drive so if we

356
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,610
don't find any bugs we don't feel that

357
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,470
we're progressing we lose master as a

358
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,160
motivator

359
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,470
you don't feel rewarded when you're

360
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,120
finding a bug maybe you get don't get

361
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,020
bound to get a duplicate you

362
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,670
I feel like your contribution was valued

363
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,740
you kind of lose that purpose as a

364
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,190
motivator and not being able to do your

365
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,810
preferred hacking techniques you have

366
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,370
you're working on a small scope and you

367
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,740
really like to do recon you can't really

368
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,330
work in your preferred way right

369
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,150
you lose autonomy as a motivator and

370
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,240
some of these we can fix but some of

371
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,750
these are like big-picture stuff and I'm

372
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,940
gonna be honest with you right now some

373
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,530
of these you might have to do some

374
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,330
soul-searching to figure out what the

375
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,580
solution is for you because this is not

376
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,450
a one-size-fits-all problem it's so many

377
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,590
different problems all into oven so with

378
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,080
all of that with all of the autonomy

379
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,450
mastery purpose stuff you're not sure

380
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,380
again what motivates you and

381
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,150
specifically I kind of want to know I

382
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,550
can't really see chat but if you DM you

383
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,840
later has that changed like for knowing

384
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,420
what kind of the three links of

385
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,550
motivation are has it changed how you

386
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,220
think about motivation I'm gonna ask you

387
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,460
to think on that for a little bit longer

388
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,340
and I really want to you to reflect on

389
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,010
that when we start talk about giving up

390
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,450
so now we understand motivation well you

391
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,080
can now start to choose our target so

392
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,700
what should our considerations be when

393
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,830
choosing a target um

394
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,040
so let's start about what we should

395
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,339
consider you know what's in scope should

396
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,730
I do a large scope or a small scope

397
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,740
public or private how is the team to

398
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,609
work with all of these ideas of you know

399
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,980
are considerations linked back into this

400
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,209
idea of motivation because if we have

401
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,980
the right things in scope we have the

402
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,780
right size scope we're working with a

403
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,780
team will then feel more motivated so

404
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,180
choosing a program can be as simple as

405
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,620
you know just scrolling down and picking

406
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,960
the first one you see on the list but if

407
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,060
we can do it more thoughtfully will feel

408
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,950
more motivated and now we know a little

409
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,230
bit about motivation I hope I can

410
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,690
convince you here that this is worth

411
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,870
considerably so some of the big ideas we

412
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,550
might say are plate

413
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,630
your strengths you already know

414
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,660
something do that where you're more or

415
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,930
less likely to find books if it's a kind

416
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,390
of actually know really well versus when

417
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,790
you don't where there's less competition

418
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,190
you know we do mobile because no one's

419
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,310
hacking on mobile the information

420
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,990
available you know what's in scope what

421
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,910
works they looking for kind of impacts

422
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,290
are looking for you're a beginner

423
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,930
there's no point approaching a kind of

424
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,740
program that once you know your are sees

425
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,060
because you're just not ready to

426
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,760
approach that and then recon you know

427
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,770
whether you can do recon a lot of people

428
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,900
at the moment are really big on kind of

429
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,760
learning recalling more about it and

430
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,280
retrain execute it but if you pick the

431
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,350
wrong kind of program you can't

432
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,320
experience recutting you can't improve

433
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,290
your mastery of recons know about lots

434
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,620
in scope so you could have a lot of

435
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,900
types of assets and scopes you've got

436
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,330
domains like a website or an app or

437
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,980
sometimes it might be a just an empty

438
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,550
domain

439
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:53,290
you might have other so that might be in

440
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,720
this case this is AWS infrastructure but

441
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,770
that might be leaked credentials if you

442
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,050
really enjoy recon of Google talking or

443
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,910
it's like you want to learn that might

444
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,290
be something to consider when you choose

445
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,640
a program looking at something that

446
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,520
accepts these other scopes Android Play

447
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,420
Store sometimes or like a mobile app

448
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,640
sometimes it's IPA sometimes apk

449
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,530
sometimes it's a swipe all of these are

450
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,440
just app types if you're interested in

451
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,840
learning mobile if you're interested in

452
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,120
okay actually one of the things that

453
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,160
really motivates me is finding more bugs

454
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,080
and knowing that I can do that it might

455
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,780
be okay let's then look at mobile

456
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,750
because it's like this rarely tested and

457
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,760
we've got source code again if you're a

458
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,500
developer may be coming in to bug

459
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,360
bounties that we select to look at or

460
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,300
against kills you know how we you can't

461
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,340
just become this expert above about it

462
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,500
this one little thing you can't just be

463
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,350
that guy you have to be this

464
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,090
well-rounded know a little bit about

465
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,610
everything we've got Hardware iron team

466
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,650
we have physical devices as well there's

467
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,540
a tour called car hacking I don't know

468
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,350
anything

469
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,660
about hardware stuff I'm very excited to

470
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,760
learn about hardware stuff but also kind

471
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,620
of spooked out because cars are like

472
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,490
giant metal death machines so that's our

473
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,110
scope and that's right really to

474
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,900
consider when we think about you know

475
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,730
motivation is what can we actually hack

476
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,440
again so let's have a chat more about

477
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,660
scope and it's all about mobile versus

478
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,549
web this is a question I personally get

479
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:27,220
asked a lot so no mobile hacking or web

480
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,669
hacking yes you should Lambos but if you

481
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:32,590
really want to pick some rich prioritize

482
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,330
you know mobile you're looking at less

483
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,940
competition you can use emulation if you

484
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,590
don't have a device it does require some

485
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,169
setup you know that setup is a great

486
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,630
barrier for people who you know maybe

487
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,010
you're a beginner maybe you need some

488
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,350
good low hanging fruit bugs maybe other

489
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,120
people can't be bothered to set up the

490
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,990
emulator

491
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,980
maybe that's free bugs um or wherever

492
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,169
you have like more competition but you

493
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:58,059
actually have more accessibility and

494
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,260
there's plenty bugs to find and where

495
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,210
please don't get me wrong I'm like no

496
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,159
bugs in web applications sorry they're

497
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,390
all gone

498
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,490
actually there's plenty to find there

499
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,400
you just need to know where to look and

500
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,929
again you need to figure out what you

501
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:14,230
need to learn to be able to approach

502
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,340
these targets little about bug types and

503
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,120
impact so we kind of have this kind of

504
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,309
gap pair of technical bugs versus non

505
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:26,049
technical bugs and I don't mean that in

506
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,270
the sense that you know you're a techie

507
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,190
or you're not so tacky

508
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,650
it's about bugs you feel like you can

509
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,890
get sometimes if you see the scope they

510
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,690
might only be looking for specific books

511
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,320
if you're not ready and licking your

512
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,460
progression a bug bounty hunter to

513
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,049
approach and RCE if you're a beginner um

514
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:48,610
then it's not gonna be the right program

515
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,190
for you on the other hand you know

516
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,820
sometimes a SKUs can be quite low in

517
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,909
terms of impact right sometimes on the

518
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:00,130
right kind of app actually idles

519
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,049
information disclosure of business logic

520
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,280
errors are going to be way more

521
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,130
impressive if you think about industries

522
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,320
health care being able to get

523
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,020
information disclosure huge book huge

524
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,480
huge book if you think about suite with

525
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,340
sandbox application

526
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,250
that's designed have code rinette RC is

527
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,810
not a good book so depending on sort of

528
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,060
what you want a hack really again we

529
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,710
come back to master streaks I think

530
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,540
mastery is so important in bug bounty

531
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,260
hunting as we start to approach mastery

532
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,330
were then going okay what bugs ohne

533
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,220
learn about which bugs do I think I can

534
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,910
get you know do I need that is if if I'm

535
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,710
looking at purposed and I want to secure

536
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,840
the internet maybe I want to not focus

537
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,770
on bugs that I can't necessarily find so

538
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,860
that's kind of everything about What's

539
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,540
in scope but let's instead talk about

540
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,260
size of scope so we talk about scope

541
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,910
sights are you talking about things you

542
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,070
could hack against and sometimes this is

543
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,260
called attack surface and when we do

544
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,210
recon we're not actually trying to find

545
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,340
bugs we're actually trying to widen our

546
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,290
attack surface and figure out what we

547
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,050
can hack against if you're really into

548
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,450
recon again looking for a large scope

549
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,210
you know if you have star dot that's

550
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,520
really good if you're into recon but you

551
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,100
might think okay large attack area lots

552
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,890
of low-hanging bugs maybe sometimes

553
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,330
there can be you know a domain gets

554
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,550
forgotten about but actually smaller

555
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,260
scopes can be ignored because people

556
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,910
think large scopes are easier they think

557
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,250
recon you know I'll just use subdomain

558
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,230
enumeration and I'll find like three

559
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,210
different bugs in ten minutes and I'll

560
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,020
do it automatically in terms of what I

561
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,670
think is a good scope to approach the

562
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,200
bat-scope I don't think this is a bad

563
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,360
size scope to approach I think we all

564
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,030
need to figure out what works for us

565
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,580
again from about autonomy what works for

566
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,000
you what the way you want to work if you

567
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,760
want to find you know subdomain

568
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,290
enumeration you should be looking at

569
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,100
large scopes

570
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,320
I think a particularly difficult scope

571
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,090
if you're a beginner can be in two

572
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,460
Auvergne scopes so where you have like

573
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,130
one login to multiple products or like

574
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,140
products that all link together in some

575
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,090
way that can be really difficult to

576
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,590
approach so I would say if you're a

577
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,840
beginner try and avoid that particular

578
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,710
one and but actually again how do you

579
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,690
like to work I can't tell you how you

580
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,960
like to work so

581
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,419
screw public versus private programs I'm

582
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:33,220
gonna be honest doesn't matter what you

583
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,919
pick honestly doesn't matter pick

584
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,590
whatever worked for the way you want a

585
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,440
hack that is autonomy that's how you

586
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,570
stay motivated you won't stay motivated

587
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,390
by jumping ship to every single private

588
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,919
program because you think the next one

589
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,870
will have more bugs in it you'll stay

590
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,510
motivated when you work the way you want

591
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,970
to work so it doesn't matter what you

592
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,730
pick and you know what sometimes people

593
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,539
forget that big companies that run

594
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:05,820
public programs have bugs in them also

595
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,320
often if they run a public program

596
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,270
they'll have that they'll have more

597
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,980
write-ups you can use that to your

598
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,580
advantage so to send those ways those

599
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,370
ways to use that to your advantage and

600
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,600
the next thing I really want to talk

601
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,070
about and I think this is really

602
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,260
important in bug bounties in particular

603
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,179
because we often deal with the other

604
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:30,789
team we're often dealing with people who

605
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:32,799
are internal and something that I

606
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,470
personally think is super important is

607
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,539
how the team is to work with and that

608
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:40,899
will give your purpose motivator that'll

609
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:41,919
make you feel like you're actually

610
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,260
contributing something because somebody

611
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,830
will reply after you send in a report

612
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,940
and the best thing you can do here is

613
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,940
look for program statistics you know the

614
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,529
important wants to know are things like

615
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,950
coverage bounty range and crowd stream

616
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,659
which you can compare against the bounty

617
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:01,210
table get an idea of what severity bugs

618
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,179
are being submitted you can kind of see

619
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:06,909
you know what might be submitted what's

620
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:10,630
paid really well sometimes etc etc and

621
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,970
then vulnerabilities rewarded known

622
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,159
issues you know newer programs might not

623
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,090
have any books all they might have loads

624
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,950
because everyone thinks that they're new

625
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,500
I'll hack them immediately and then

626
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,240
we've got validation within next day so

627
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,250
you can see how active the program is

628
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,929
see that they're working engaging with

629
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:31,779
you really because you don't want to

630
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:33,730
submit a bug and then not hear back that

631
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,020
will kill you purpose motivator and

632
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,159
disclosures and stuff like that can be

633
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,710
really great if you looking at hacking a

634
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,750
target

635
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,450
how they interact with people who

636
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,240
essentially find bugs for them and do

637
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,820
that labor are they super standoffish

638
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,120
are they actually really friendly it can

639
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,130
really give you an insight into this how

640
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,740
teams are to work with you and maybe if

641
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,590
you've been bug hunting for ages you

642
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,500
don't necessarily need like a triage to

643
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,740
come and hold your hand and help you out

644
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,660
but just be feeling like you've been

645
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,150
rewarded and feeling like somebody cares

646
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,510
about what you found can be really

647
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,490
motivating if it doesn't make even miss

648
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,000
a duplicate just being told not thanks

649
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,530
you know what we really appreciate it

650
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,420
sorry didn't get a bounty but actually

651
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,630
we really appreciate your work if the

652
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,000
team is understanding and professional

653
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,710
they're really great for beginners as

654
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,420
well they might prompt you for more

655
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,730
detailed info if you don't quite explain

656
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,260
something correctly if they're just

657
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,690
gonna reply back and give you a really

658
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,670
kind of sometimes it can be rude to you

659
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,650
would just be like you don't know what

660
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,090
you're talking about

661
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,940
they might not be great for beginners

662
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,440
but be having that insight into how they

663
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,120
work can be great to see how that will

664
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,660
help your motivation so what should I

665
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,450
look for let's talk about this checklist

666
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,600
um so things you should always look for

667
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,640
no matter what the program is no matter

668
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,080
what you're talking about

669
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,840
a friendly unresponsive team that's your

670
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,570
purpose motivator a large enough scope

671
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,970
that you can pivot you know it's really

672
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,310
easy to lose that mastery that feeling

673
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,800
like you're not getting anywhere but if

674
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,080
you can pivot to a different product but

675
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,060
still use that same knowledge you can

676
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,680
actually feel like you're still

677
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,300
progressing you're still improving

678
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,910
you've still got mastery you know you're

679
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,970
going through that process a scope that

680
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,500
isn't completely interconnected so you

681
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,390
just don't get lost you don't get lost

682
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,690
in like everything you have to do a team

683
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,100
that's interesting the types of books

684
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,950
you can find and generate impact with

685
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,690
you really don't as a beginner when it

686
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,520
be looking at a program that looking for

687
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,880
like really complex bugs because you're

688
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,440
not gonna get anywhere you're just gonna

689
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,200
feel stuck essentially and then an

690
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,470
interesting attack surface it really

691
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,360
helps

692
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,340
and specifically for purpose as a

693
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,580
motivator to have an attack app you

694
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,710
already use because you want to secure

695
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,390
it so at the end of the day they have

696
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,270
your data and it would be really awful

697
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,580
if something was to happen to it just

698
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,610
feeding Li so that's why I think you

699
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,900
should always look for when you choose a

700
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,370
program but actually let's talk about

701
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,830
what you can decide assets that place

702
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,890
your strengths um you know if you want

703
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,650
to do where do web obviously don't do

704
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,890
mobile maybe don't pick a web asset just

705
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,710
saying and then a public or a private

706
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,480
program wherever you're more comfortable

707
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,880
with and whatever you think you can

708
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,309
approach and I'm gonna add these extra

709
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,710
ones here does it challenge your skills

710
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,299
are you getting that feeling of

711
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:43,790
improvement is that feeding that mastery

712
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,340
does it let you hack the way you want to

713
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,890
do you have the autonomy to do what you

714
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,260
want how you want and then does it

715
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,660
interest you don't have got an app

716
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,510
you're not interested in because you

717
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,210
don't care what happens to it who cares

718
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,640
if ya another Bitcoin wallet app loses

719
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,830
your data when you don't store Bitcoin

720
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,470
bitcoins in it right pick something that

721
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,330
interest you so this is where I join us

722
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,520
all together we talked about motivation

723
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,350
and I've talked about choosing a target

724
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,559
and I hope I've convinced you that these

725
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:24,410
two are quite interconnected and I want

726
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,090
to talk about something that I don't

727
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,740
think is talked about enough for sure

728
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,450
like I don't think anybody is really

729
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,080
talking about this when do you give up a

730
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,970
lot of the kind of conventional wisdom

731
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,490
and this is never give up never give up

732
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,809
keep trying d'amato try harder you know

733
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:44,179
what sometimes it's okay to give up and

734
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,940
I'm gonna tell you when when shouldn't

735
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,640
you give up let's start with that don't

736
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,190
just give up because it's hard bug

737
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,520
bounties are hard I'm going to and I'm

738
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,260
not saying that to kind of talk down to

739
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,200
a belittle you I'm giving you validation

740
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,110
it's hard to find your first bug it

741
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,510
takes a long time to find your first bug

742
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,130
it can take a long time to find your

743
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,190
4000

744
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,860
look it can take a lot time it can be

745
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,159
really hard to find your 50th bug it's

746
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,169
always gonna be hard it's always gonna

747
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,720
be taking a long time it's okay if it

748
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,360
does you you don't have to give up if

749
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,820
it's just because it's hard and it takes

750
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,240
a long time you also shouldn't get give

751
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,330
up because you're confused like we all

752
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,929
have notebooks notebooks everywhere

753
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:38,690
because we all get confused we all need

754
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,250
to take notes we all need to sit there

755
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,769
and scribble furiously how something

756
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:45,019
works and you shouldn't give up because

757
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:47,269
you don't get a bounty a lot of people

758
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:49,309
tell me I found my first bird no

759
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:51,860
duplicate and it's like would you buy

760
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,320
are you sodding so sad that's amazing

761
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,029
well done congratulations you know if

762
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:01,370
you get a duplicate and you don't get a

763
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,710
bounty that doesn't mean you haven't

764
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,799
found a bug that means somebody found it

765
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,159
first

766
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,009
you absolutely found the bug

767
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:12,139
congratulations well done I'm sorry you

768
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,730
didn't get a bounty I know that can be

769
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,039
demotivating but you know what you've

770
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,360
you come to me and say Kate you have

771
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,679
found my first bug but it was a

772
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:20,269
duplicate you know what I'm gonna say

773
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:21,710
I'm gonna sit there like this and be

774
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,710
like yeah you go rocket that's amazing

775
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,470
congratulations because that is a book

776
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,559
and all of this kind of rolls into this

777
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,440
it's just part of God bounty hunting you

778
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,539
know what you are not the only person

779
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,059
that gets disappointed because you found

780
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,950
a duplicate you're not the only person

781
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,679
who gets duplicates I've got like 30

782
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,039
bucks I think 20 of the produ pockets I

783
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,009
have so many duplicates I think anybody

784
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,779
who does bug bounties but any

785
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,539
considerable period of time has a ton of

786
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:59,929
duplicates so some affirmations

787
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:01,970
you put the writing this down put an

788
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,330
extra bed you will get dupes a hundred

789
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,669
percent you will get them it's a fact of

790
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:08,090
life

791
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,720
I'm sorry it sucks but just because you

792
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,700
lose perhaps money as a motivator

793
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,039
doesn't meet you haven't gotten better

794
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,649
that mastery doesn't mean your

795
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:21,379
contribution to the community wasn't

796
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:24,059
useful your purpose he doesn't mean

797
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,489
but you don't get to hack the way you

798
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:30,210
want you still have that motivation just

799
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,450
keep going you will always get confused

800
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,570
and stuck it happens to us best to the

801
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,239
best of us right and the reason why the

802
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,340
top bounty hunters tend to get over this

803
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,590
sooner is because all they do is they go

804
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,659
ask their friends and then somebody else

805
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,999
comes up with my dear but bounty is

806
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:50,340
collaborative right if you get confused

807
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,649
and stuck even for a beginner join

808
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:55,080
discards like the book crowd discord go

809
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,529
hey can anyone give me some help right

810
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:00,690
involve yourself in that community make

811
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,249
those connections and then use other

812
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,889
people's brains just like offloading

813
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:08,159
power it's like you know a wsy by your

814
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,250
own survey just borrow somebody else's

815
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,629
book hunting is high it takes ages time

816
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:15,899
to book it does it reads sometimes you

817
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,399
might find a bug in five minutes I've

818
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,289
done I found about in five minutes and

819
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:23,159
that was amazing that's not the normal

820
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,159
that is very much not normal

821
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,440
you will spend weeks on some projects

822
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,589
right you might end up you know looking

823
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:35,339
at this massive application and you

824
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,339
spend three weeks looking at it and you

825
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,079
don't find anything and that just

826
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,679
happens it happens to everybody and

827
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,849
feeling like that having those

828
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,099
experience don't make you a failure and

829
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,809
it doesn't mean you should give up you

830
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:50,760
are still valid and welcoming this

831
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,168
community even if you feel like you're

832
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:58,559
don't belong so now I've hopefully

833
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,490
convinced you not to give up so quickly

834
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,690
I'm gonna tell you when you should give

835
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,000
up um and first time I talk about types

836
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,150
of giving up so giving up forever versus

837
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,160
giving up for a little bit when should

838
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,170
you just call it quits and target just

839
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,390
go you know what I've tried I've tried

840
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,299
my best it's not happening and when

841
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:21,900
should you just take your computer close

842
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,539
your computer walk away for an hour and

843
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,510
then come back so I'm first going to

844
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,319
talk about giving up forever so when

845
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:32,940
should you give up when you should you

846
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,440
give up the target when should you give

847
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,000
up on the bug

848
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
when your loss of motivation is directly

849
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,710
linked to the program you're hacking on

850
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,840
the bug bounds platform of about you but

851
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,470
bounties themselves so if you found that

852
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,350
actually that target isn't allowing you

853
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,540
tack the way you want maybe need a beep

854
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,190
yet and right and you don't necessarily

855
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,410
want to be bothered with all the setup

856
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,840
maybe it only has mobile apps and you

857
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,990
know what you can't be bothered today

858
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:05,070
that's fine give up um so I make sure

859
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,620
you don't over recap mastery getting

860
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,290
better at something purpose feeling like

861
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,910
contributes aren't greater than yourself

862
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,390
autonomy doing things the way you want

863
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,170
those are our kind of core ideas because

864
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,730
I'm gonna tell you how to regain your

865
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,130
motivation if you lose one of these look

866
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,590
at mastery so I'm really big on

867
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,200
goal-setting really big on goal-setting

868
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,470
it is the best way to keep mastery as a

869
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,110
motivator and to keep going and to keep

870
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,590
working even though it's hard so when we

871
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,280
make goals

872
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,740
you should make SMART goals and this is

873
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,830
coming across very much like I'm in

874
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,720
University and I'm teaching you study

875
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,960
skills but I promise it's important so

876
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,270
when we talk about SMART goals or smart

877
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,220
objectives we talked about goals that

878
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,950
are specific measurable achievable

879
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,280
realistic and timely and sometimes time

880
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,480
bound so specific what makes a goal

881
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,900
specific it means you can define it well

882
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,810
bad would be I want to learn about

883
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,790
exercise what do you want to learn about

884
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,130
it you want to learn about how it works

885
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,470
how to write good exploit for it do you

886
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,240
wanna know the bypasses there's so many

887
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,510
ideas that get into oven and you might

888
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,060
say my goal is just to learn about XSS

889
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,150
okay split it up make those goals as

890
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,700
specific as possible you want to learn

891
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,790
about excess you wanna learn about XSS

892
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,300
bypasses that sugar do you want to learn

893
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,240
about how to write an exploit that like

894
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,930
uses an IDE or for example that's your

895
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,670
goal your goal isn't to learn about it

896
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,870
it's to break it down

897
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:52,660
and we have measurable now mastery is

898
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,950
the feeling of getting better at

899
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,450
something if you have a goal and you

900
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,940
don't feel like you've improving how on

901
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,790
earth can you feel like you have mastery

902
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,190
as a motivator so then we talk about

903
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,000
something being measurable like your

904
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,630
goal shouldn't be to take my example to

905
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,330
learn about XSS bypasses baby it's to

906
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,510
okay I want to be able to pop a bypass

907
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,670
on this on this on that or maybe it's to

908
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,860
work through some lab exercises whatever

909
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,410
that ideally you could have a checkbox

910
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:28,210
and tick them off achievable don't pick

911
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,710
a goal you can't reach don't have a goal

912
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,050
get an get an ass you when you've been

913
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,920
bug hunting for five days it's not gonna

914
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,030
happen yet that's a long-term goal so

915
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,430
then realistic and timely kind of come

916
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,060
together

917
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,700
so would you mean to be realistic if you

918
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,130
set yourself a time bound goal of I want

919
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,270
to learn how to MIT how to pop an XSS in

920
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,090
three weeks can you actually do that in

921
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,590
three weeks would be the kind of

922
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,740
realistic art element of that and timely

923
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,270
just means you know time bound don't

924
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,780
just let your goals sit there in on your

925
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,850
notebook forever on a post-it note stuck

926
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,740
to your monitor I'll get round to it

927
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,870
eventually no you get round to it now

928
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:19,600
and you just get side so the best way to

929
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,090
regain your mastery is to get control of

930
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,120
these ideas of goals you should have

931
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,920
long term goals and short term goals I

932
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,170
actually have an entire video on goal

933
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,150
setting and how to stay motivated with

934
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,280
goals I recommend watching that one from

935
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,760
far more in depth information about it

936
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,700
loss of purpose is a motivator oh okay

937
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,700
now master is quite easy to explain how

938
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,370
to get it back because it is

939
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,530
goal-setting purpose can involve

940
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,780
soul-searching and one thing I recommend

941
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,180
that everybody does is engage in a

942
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,680
period of self-reflection

943
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,280
every week every day think about how you

944
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,190
feel like how do you feel about what

945
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,470
you've accomplished what do you want to

946
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,430
do next

947
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,440
really engage in that self-reflection

948
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,049
like process and you'll understand what

949
00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:11,650
purpose as a motivator means to you that

950
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,520
could mean for you um feeling like you

951
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,930
want to make the internet more secure

952
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,119
right so if you want to do that that's

953
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,029
really saying you need to search for in

954
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:25,329
terms of like small ideas like working

955
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:27,250
with a program that might be checking

956
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,740
that they actually appreciate you and

957
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,750
that they want to engage with you and

958
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,490
that can be site but it's usually

959
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,210
google-able

960
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,609
but actually self-reflection can be the

961
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:40,000
best way to regain some of this and I

962
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,440
can't tell you what the answer is

963
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,380
because it will be so unique to you you

964
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,599
you just need to fight figure out for

965
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:50,589
yourself so first one very actionable

966
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:52,900
this one bit wishy-washy

967
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,150
look into the distance have a bit of a

968
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,150
think put your thinking cap on and have

969
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,329
a good time talking to yourself so let's

970
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:03,430
talk about autonomy if you lose your

971
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,799
autonomy justly if you can't work the

972
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,630
way you want to work what's the point

973
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,710
right you're working on a target the is

974
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,760
designed for people who really like

975
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,039
recon you don't enjoy refund it's not so

976
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,440
it you want to learn just jump [ __ ] if

977
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,230
you're looking at bugs you don't feel

978
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,690
like you could pop and it's once again

979
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,640
not part of your kind of planned for

980
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,059
your learning and your mastery there's

981
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:30,700
no point doing something if you don't

982
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,880
like it a pet really obvious advice but

983
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,130
if you really do feel like you've lost

984
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,579
your autonomy just jump yet and you

985
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:42,700
might be thinking Kati these all sound

986
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,640
rather interconnected and if you were

987
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,579
thinking that you'd be correct

988
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:51,609
oftentimes our motivation is so linked

989
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,710
together we can't necessarily know how

990
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,170
we feel and again I really recommend

991
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,420
engaging in self-reflection you don't

992
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,069
need to write it down you don't need to

993
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:03,640
tell anyone just cut a part of your day

994
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,049
maybe it's the end of the day mix the

995
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:07,329
end of the week on a Friday and just

996
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:09,190
think about you how are you progressing

997
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,500
in your goals how are you working

998
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,369
towards where you want to be in life and

999
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:16,599
sometimes you might not have an answer

1000
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:17,319
or you might have an

1001
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:21,359
it goes I don't know that's fine

1002
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,170
engaging on that process of

1003
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,719
self-reflection and continually doing it

1004
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:27,459
will help you to understand these

1005
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:31,049
motivation factors better so I'm gonna

1006
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,839
talk about keeping up for a little bit

1007
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,380
and the idea of this is giving up and

1008
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,969
coming back to something being the

1009
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:43,180
motivation boomerang and sometimes as as

1010
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,180
simple as literally you spend all day on

1011
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,160
something your brain is completely fried

1012
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,859
it's full of mush you get off of your

1013
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,680
computer walk away from the computer

1014
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,349
don't come near the computer go have a

1015
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:58,690
shower go do something else

1016
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,519
take a break go have some dinner

1017
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:03,249
whatever and then come back to it give

1018
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:05,469
you brain arrest it's a guarantee as

1019
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:07,930
you're sitting in the shower feeling the

1020
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,900
water kind of come down you'll figure

1021
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,789
out the exploit right you'll figure out

1022
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:15,009
how to do it it's okay to take a break

1023
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,900
to something and come back to it later

1024
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,779
these are roadblocks but you should have

1025
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:21,670
a plan to resolve these roadblocks you

1026
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,739
know even if that's just literally you

1027
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:25,269
don't have to write it down just having

1028
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,039
an idea of what the roadblock is and how

1029
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:31,089
to overcome it so why did you give up a

1030
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:33,400
bubble target on a program is beyond

1031
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,119
your skill level that's fine to just

1032
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,309
finish with that target and move on to

1033
00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:41,499
something else but you should know you

1034
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:43,239
know what you need to learn what does

1035
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:45,160
that tell you about your skills that

1036
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,130
will help you set goals because you'll

1037
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:51,039
know what you need to learn next and

1038
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:52,380
what you want to learn next

1039
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,089
don't lie give up you don't have the

1040
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:58,029
time to commit to a program or bug right

1041
00:43:58,029 --> 00:44:01,029
now you know a lot of people have

1042
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:03,940
hobbies that turnable computer they have

1043
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,309
work they might have a family they might

1044
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:08,619
have childcare they might want to just

1045
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:11,499
do literally anything else and a lot of

1046
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:13,359
the time it can be tempting to just go

1047
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,199
I'll just stop sleeping or I'll just

1048
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,859
have a really quick dinner it's fine to

1049
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:22,749
not have time you can take a break I'm

1050
00:44:22,749 --> 00:44:24,579
gonna give you permission I write you a

1051
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,979
permission slip if you would like and it

1052
00:44:26,979 --> 00:44:29,650
will say yes you can take a break don't

1053
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,500
worry

1054
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,440
but you should know when you will have

1055
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,420
time and plan out what you want to do

1056
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:35,960
next

1057
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,930
actually it can be really useful to kind

1058
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,730
of recap yourself okay

1059
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,440
here's everything I know about target

1060
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,300
and here's how I want to know more about

1061
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,140
target so why give up you need some time

1062
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,750
to think about something you know I'm

1063
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,590
sure I'm not the only one who has got to

1064
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,840
do something else and then had an idea

1065
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,020
about how to exploit something or find

1066
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,800
something one time I was making a video

1067
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,470
I think it was it was a business logic

1068
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,790
speaking out occurring which video it

1069
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,130
was I was making a video writing up the

1070
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,410
slides and I had this epiphany when I

1071
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,420
was reading one of the example reports I

1072
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,800
was like I don't know how to exploit

1073
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,210
that bug and I checked it wasn't

1074
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,560
accepting submissions anymore

1075
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,200
so this happens sometimes you just need

1076
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,660
to let a bug sit with you just keep

1077
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,260
thinking about it just let your brain

1078
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,030
process other things and then so it will

1079
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:36,440
inspire it so why give up you need a

1080
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,839
break

1081
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,970
there is no problem with taking a break

1082
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:42,619
from bug bounties we talked about

1083
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:46,670
burnout a lot in this community and a

1084
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:50,260
lot of people feel extremely burned out

1085
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,910
it's okay to take a break do take a

1086
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,800
break you know what you're not getting

1087
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,160
any joy from bug bounties just don't do

1088
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,020
that for a while do something else as a

1089
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,390
hobby maybe you know you do feel like

1090
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,400
you want to keep improving maybe pick up

1091
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,230
developing for example pick up something

1092
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:11,990
related right so it's okay to give up no

1093
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:15,890
no seriously it really is okay to give

1094
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:19,010
up but you should know and understand

1095
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,619
why you want to give up and explore why

1096
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:24,320
you do you know is it the motivation

1097
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,570
because of this idea of math mastery

1098
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,520
purpose or autonomy then it is a

1099
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,020
temporary roadblock how are you gonna

1100
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,890
deal with that and when should you stick

1101
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,770
with it bug bounty is not as easy as

1102
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,830
Twitter would make it out to be but I'm

1103
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,010
gonna be honest it feels really really

1104
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:43,910
really

1105
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:47,000
good it is amazing it is the best high

1106
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,890
you will ever experience it feels so so

1107
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:55,400
good so if this lack of motivation and

1108
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,900
soul-searching doesn't really apply to

1109
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,410
you don't give up too soon and just

1110
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:03,170
stick with it just keep going because

1111
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,630
sometimes sometimes you do need to try

1112
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,200
harder so I'm gonna leave you with some

1113
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,930
further reading and then a final thought

1114
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,789
so here are two of things that I've

1115
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:17,299
watched and read recently one of them is

1116
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:20,210
this article by Vicki Lee talking about

1117
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,130
while you fail at bug bounties you some

1118
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,200
good inspiration watch that

1119
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,390
I'm sorry read that and then the other

1120
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:29,030
one is Stokes video on mental hacking

1121
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,309
for better bounties which is amazing

1122
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:33,170
because he uses post-it notes and I love

1123
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,089
post-it notes and there was something

1124
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:36,890
very satisfying about seeing post-it

1125
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:40,069
notes being slapped on a lot on a board

1126
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:42,289
they just appealed to me and again

1127
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:44,329
that's talking about kind of the same

1128
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,869
ideas and there's quite a lot of mental

1129
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:49,609
aspects to hacking that don't

1130
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:51,020
necessarily get explored the way they

1131
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,349
should so to end my final thought you

1132
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:59,839
you dear viewer dear listener you are

1133
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:03,470
not a hacking machine okay you are a

1134
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,619
human you can act like a human it's okay

1135
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:09,529
you don't need to be getting bugs all

1136
00:48:09,529 --> 00:48:12,559
the time working constantly even though

1137
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,559
you hate it trying harder you're a human

1138
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,250
treat yourself like one just take that

1139
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:23,089
time to figure out what the human side

1140
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:26,539
of you needs so that is the end of a

1141
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,490
slideshow thank you very much for

1142
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:31,730
listening to me I hope you found this

1143
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:36,920
useful engaging not another presumably

1144
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,690
positive word and I'm quite happy to do

1145
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:48,890
questions that was so awesome Kerry I am

1146
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:52,760
a huge fan of the soft the soft approach

1147
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,089
to such a technical and mind driven

1148
00:48:56,089 --> 00:48:57,650
thing that bounties are for us

1149
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:59,450
you know it's it's an extremely

1150
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,270
competitive space and the way that you

1151
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,700
broke down all the questions that's been

1152
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,710
going through my mind and a lot of other

1153
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,750
people's in such an easy digestible way

1154
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:12,529
was super super super cool and yeah I've

1155
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:15,650
had those lying in bed not being able to

1156
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,230
your ears waking up and realizing that

1157
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,289
holy [ __ ] what's going on door that

1158
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:23,480
epiphany in the shower moment when

1159
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,579
you're like oh oh my god

1160
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:29,839
I just got it so and I think we've got a

1161
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,670
couple of questions for you and I'm just

1162
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,740
gonna fire one of them straight out of

1163
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:38,569
it so I'm ready okay so how long does it

1164
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:41,150
take him how long did it take for you to

1165
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:44,150
find your first bug and it was that a

1166
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,190
dupe

1167
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,440
so my first bug was not a dupe but I do

1168
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,960
have a story around it so I'm very

1169
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,849
fortunate that when I started bug

1170
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:54,529
bounties they weren't something new to

1171
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:55,609
me have some friends in the community

1172
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:58,520
already so one of my friends you knew at

1173
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,230
university is very active in the

1174
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,789
community aspect like I used to run

1175
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:03,920
Computer Society and I used to run

1176
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,720
mentoring sessions and all this kind of

1177
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,480
thing it was like Katie there's a

1178
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,299
there's an event in London this link is

1179
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:14,569
going around some groups apply and I was

1180
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:18,829
like nice I turned down mentoring at a

1181
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:21,529
life hacking event to begin with and

1182
00:50:21,529 --> 00:50:24,710
then I was like you know what he kept

1183
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:26,089
bothering me I was like yeah fine I'll

1184
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,029
do it whatever I just really need to

1185
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:31,190
understand what I had like a lot of

1186
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,450
people really liked about them I'm just

1187
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,640
sitting there like yeah I guess I'll

1188
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,270
have a go

1189
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,980
I wasn't expecting by my first book I

1190
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,170
was really fortunate that I had access

1191
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,900
to some of the best hackers who when I

1192
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,180
found like something interesting they're

1193
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,760
able to go here's the exploit and what

1194
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,470
we're gonna do now is we're gonna take

1195
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:51,799
this like weird thing I found it was

1196
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:54,369
really just a request that looked weird

1197
00:50:54,369 --> 00:50:58,430
and I'll show you how to do an exploit

1198
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,109
and I'll teach you it so I got some help

1199
00:51:00,109 --> 00:51:01,440
in that

1200
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,240
and we've gotten to a point where we

1201
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,180
couldn't exploit it anymore but the

1202
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,160
event was ending so we called over the

1203
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,910
customer representative I like so is

1204
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,490
this a book cuz at this point I never

1205
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:16,230
found a book before I'd been doing it

1206
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:20,130
for like five hours I really didn't know

1207
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,990
what I was doing and the customer was

1208
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:25,349
like I thought we fixed that one which

1209
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:29,520
gave me a great kinda yes I found

1210
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,800
something it was incredible feeling for

1211
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,680
the first time so it could I was very

1212
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,069
fortunate my experience is not what

1213
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:39,630
everybody else gets and that's part of

1214
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,740
the reason why I like to make videos

1215
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,200
because not everybody has access to like

1216
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,760
the mentoring that I was able to get

1217
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,520
access to and so I found during my

1218
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,780
mentoring session the pledge new

1219
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,660
organized it was like you know I want

1220
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,420
you as mentees to be able to mentor new

1221
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,310
hackers and that's something that I

1222
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,160
think I've kept really dear to my heart

1223
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,619
in making my videos interacting with my

1224
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,020
audience answering questions that part

1225
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,319
of your job as a hacker is to help new

1226
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:09,510
hackers like they catch me I want to

1227
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:10,640
help

1228
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:16,200
so that's so good the idea of like being

1229
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,420
able to learn to the point where you're

1230
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,119
where you're able to pass it on not just

1231
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,160
where you're able to use it and actually

1232
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,560
having that be part of your goal as you

1233
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,859
learn just good things happen when you

1234
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:30,720
apply that kind of principle I think in

1235
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,160
general but especially here that's

1236
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,069
that's really cool I think what really

1237
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,290
helped my youtube channel like I don't

1238
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,730
want to say take Hawks didn't really

1239
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,900
like I don't have millions of

1240
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,730
subscribers and millions of views but I

1241
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:42,930
think saying that makes my youtube

1242
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,200
channel kind of unique in another way is

1243
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,589
I'm not an expert you know when I make

1244
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:51,390
my video on a sneeze I didn't actually

1245
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:53,970
know that much about making our C's I

1246
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,490
can sit in the position of being a

1247
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,220
beginner because I am one no I don't

1248
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,940
know everything I thought not an expert

1249
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,710
and that really helps for me to

1250
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,410
understand coming into it what beginners

1251
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,180
gonna struggle with I make videos like

1252
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,190
really early when I've been hacking for

1253
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,950
only a few months but because my new

1254
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,119
wheels like to be a beginner

1255
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,859
I knew what people struggled with I knew

1256
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:19,019
the type of content that needed to be

1257
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:23,160
out there for people I'm doing the same

1258
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,900
thing that's that's what I've been doing

1259
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,180
for C's day one you know I stumble into

1260
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,779
this like oh it's logging and having

1261
00:53:30,779 --> 00:53:33,059
drinks like somebody said like have you

1262
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:39,259
seen burp I'm like who's burp oh yeah

1263
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:42,509
what even is this burp thing what is

1264
00:53:42,509 --> 00:53:47,009
above hey hey just don't yeah

1265
00:53:47,009 --> 00:53:50,969
what is off off we got you Katie there's

1266
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:53,640
a just on that with you YouTube stream

1267
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,839
there's a couple of people that have

1268
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,489
just asked for a reminder on what your

1269
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:59,130
channel is so that we can be ringing the

1270
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,930
bell one make sure that you get a couple

1271
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,089
of opportunities to be calling that out

1272
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:07,410
as well I'm quite proud because now you

1273
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,420
can search inside a phd insider as in

1274
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,269
not inside a I really figure out that

1275
00:54:15,269 --> 00:54:18,690
way of saying that inside inside a PhD

1276
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,369
actually I have got my little whiteboard

1277
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:22,440
hair pencil if it's an American audience

1278
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,059
it it have to be insider th true yeah

1279
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:28,650
but you can look up Katie

1280
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,599
and then I understand if you write

1281
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:35,150
inside a PHP my name also comes up now

1282
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,499
PhD as in the thing you get like a

1283
00:54:37,499 --> 00:54:42,150
doctor because you can connect you can

1284
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,719
connect in it and find Katie's channels

1285
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:47,849
on the LevelUp website so if you go to

1286
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:49,499
level up got SH I think everyone's

1287
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:52,289
pretty familiar with that and you'll at

1288
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,579
least find out Twitter there and from

1289
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:55,589
there you can like do some ocean to find

1290
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:59,190
their YouTube cool scavenger hunt what a

1291
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,200
one thing I'd love to hear more for you

1292
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,900
about to like I love this era that we're

1293
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,309
moving into a vacuum where people are

1294
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:07,109
very openly talking about mental health

1295
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:08,999
and things like that I feel like for

1296
00:55:08,999 --> 00:55:11,579
years in OS CP we've talked really well

1297
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,289
about that context which to the need if

1298
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:14,940
you do the osep you've got it at a break

1299
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,380
but not so much elsewhere you're right

1300
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,029
people hinge on you've got to focus

1301
00:55:18,029 --> 00:55:20,219
you've got a deep dive the other element

1302
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:22,499
to that I think is like how do you

1303
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:24,989
recognize burnouts creeping in and how

1304
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,569
do you decide it's time to take a break

1305
00:55:27,569 --> 00:55:29,019
like what are your kind of

1306
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:30,069
used to yourself where you go you know

1307
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:32,349
what I just need to take a break this is

1308
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:36,489
hitting that point so I think what hits

1309
00:55:36,489 --> 00:55:38,739
me first so I do a PhD it's my day job a

1310
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:42,519
PhD is the ultimate version or burnout

1311
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:45,609
because with research and doing a PhD

1312
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:49,179
you can spend ages doing research you

1313
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,249
can sit there and fine-tune our

1314
00:55:51,249 --> 00:55:53,229
algorithm to the inch of its life you

1315
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:58,329
can chase 0.01% better performance and

1316
00:55:58,329 --> 00:56:01,349
you can really an academia in general

1317
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:06,039
academia ran really really struggle to

1318
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:08,829
burnout and I think coming for an

1319
00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:10,929
environment where burnout is talked

1320
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:13,419
about a lot like in when we talk about

1321
00:56:13,419 --> 00:56:16,029
students we talk about burnout tons

1322
00:56:16,029 --> 00:56:17,649
academia just pull the phone out

1323
00:56:17,649 --> 00:56:19,059
question you ever seen academic Twitter

1324
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:21,099
it's full of people burning out how'd

1325
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:23,769
you recognize burnout this is what

1326
00:56:23,769 --> 00:56:26,049
probably the most important thing and it

1327
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,519
sounds really wish you watch every site

1328
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:30,549
is knowing yourself like for me I know

1329
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:34,539
I'm experiencing burnout when I look in

1330
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:36,849
my email inbox and I see new invites to

1331
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:40,809
private programs and I feel nothing

1332
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:41,559
towards them

1333
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:46,229
I just feel meh I don't care whatever

1334
00:56:46,229 --> 00:56:49,029
and just let them expire that's when I

1335
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:52,630
know that I'm burnt out how you can

1336
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,309
recognize it in yourself is that you you

1337
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:56,079
just have to learn what it means to be

1338
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,019
for you I'm very fortunate one of the

1339
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:00,759
ways I beat burnout is that I do a lot

1340
00:57:00,759 --> 00:57:03,729
of crafting anyone who kind of follows

1341
00:57:03,729 --> 00:57:06,130
me know I wear lucky socks and in case

1342
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,429
you're wondering I've seen them I am

1343
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:11,259
wearing lucky socks right now so if you

1344
00:57:11,259 --> 00:57:14,289
ask me how am I talk went went so well

1345
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:15,999
it's the lucky sock it's always look

1346
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,869
nice look so I knit in my free time and

1347
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:21,759
that really helped me making start with

1348
00:57:21,759 --> 00:57:24,279
my hands for me personally no no sorry

1349
00:57:24,279 --> 00:57:26,949
for you but for me making soap my hands

1350
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:28,779
when we use computers it feels very

1351
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,179
virtual you know you can't take your

1352
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:34,299
computer take it to your mom and go look

1353
00:57:34,299 --> 00:57:37,089
at what I made cuz my mom doesn't care

1354
00:57:37,089 --> 00:57:40,179
my lab has complete indifference to what

1355
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:42,399
I've made on the computer but if I show

1356
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,730
us

1357
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,410
I've made like in real life with

1358
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:47,680
crafting people understand that it feels

1359
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,170
less ephemeral and to me that also feels

1360
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,030
more real and that really helps keep me

1361
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:54,369
motivated I don't know what you you can

1362
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:57,640
learn to get a crochet it's fun

1363
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,350
spread all my bounties on knitting

1364
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,619
supply it's not even joking come that's

1365
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:03,250
awesome

1366
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,200
I've got a question from the Shatt here

1367
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,090
and I see I'm gonna see if I'm able to

1368
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:09,910
just get that out dry so bear with me

1369
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:12,880
though the question is from yeah couch

1370
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,420
and large enough scope slash scope that

1371
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,609
isn't interconnected could you elaborate

1372
00:58:18,609 --> 00:58:21,119
on that with an example if it's possible

1373
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,550
so a really inspected scope is one where

1374
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,619
you might have one login for multiple

1375
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:28,480
products and products that interlink

1376
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,580
with each other let's say you're working

1377
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,619
with a platform that handles a lot of

1378
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:36,070
data you might have a like app that just

1379
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,410
handles ingesting all the data into the

1380
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:39,910
app you might have another app which

1381
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,130
just visualize it as spreadsheet another

1382
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:44,290
one that makes grass so when you start

1383
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,520
to do all those scopes that have a

1384
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,900
socialite the interconnection interwoven

1385
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,270
it can be really difficult to follow the

1386
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:51,690
flow of what an application is doing

1387
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:53,859
because for that though it might be

1388
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:55,420
quite simple you do this then you

1389
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,220
basically do this but actually for some

1390
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,070
of them like it can be way more complex

1391
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,350
than that you can deal with you know you

1392
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:05,380
ingest data and then step two might be

1393
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,940
then you could do some machine learning

1394
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,980
or step two might be and then you can

1395
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,950
visualize it and then you can do so when

1396
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:14,350
I say interconnected scope into woven

1397
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,970
scope I'm talking about those apps that

1398
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,130
just contain everything like Google does

1399
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:20,290
you know you have one login to Google

1400
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,600
Google Drive connects to the Gmail

1401
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,690
connects to your calendar that kind of

1402
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,250
scope can be really difficult to

1403
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,430
approach and I say large enough scope I

1404
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:33,550
mean I don't where you can pivot so you

1405
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,080
might have something like Google where

1406
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,940
every product is quite interconnected or

1407
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,130
you might have something where you know

1408
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:42,280
you have I don't know a single app

1409
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,440
another single app and another single

1410
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,700
app but actually they're in the same

1411
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,550
scope so you can kind of learn a bit

1412
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,410
about what developers are doing from one

1413
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:52,300
app and transfer that knowledge to the

1414
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,369
other one so you might be able to kind

1415
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:56,150
of follow their thought process a little

1416
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:57,440
that's what I mean when I say those two

1417
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,500
things it's awesome

1418
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,980
hey ko the question for you just on the

1419
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,720
machine learning and artificial

1420
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,110
intelligence and all things singularity

1421
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,810
and cyber and the goodness that you've

1422
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:14,960
been waiting in through hurt you PhD

1423
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,630
yes a common question that I think comes

1424
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,540
up especially for for you know folks at

1425
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,330
nua in the inoffensive sob security

1426
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:25,820
about to you hunting it's like is I are

1427
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,310
going to take my job you know we're

1428
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,680
going to end up in a position where like

1429
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,450
this the kind of things that we can

1430
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,840
deliver as value as as individuals and

1431
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,310
even as an industry are going to be

1432
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:40,490
replaced by computers and you kind of

1433
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:41,750
lead off into whatever you want to talk

1434
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,220
about on the m/l side as well but that's

1435
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,960
specific one for the audience I think is

1436
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,780
a really interesting one to riff on okay

1437
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:50,870
cool this is a question that I get asked

1438
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,130
a lot actually because my background is

1439
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:55,040
a data science which is really it's

1440
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,200
machine learning plus statistics plus

1441
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,690
data visualization plus you know

1442
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,420
answering big questions and for espect

1443
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:06,260
'iv AI can really only be used to answer

1444
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,750
questions of data that sounds kind of

1445
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,180
weird so what that might be in terms of

1446
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:13,460
more real is if you run a bug bounty

1447
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,970
program AI will tell you what is the bug

1448
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:19,730
we are most likely to find what is the

1449
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,090
product that may contain the most bugs

1450
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,310
from a bug hunting side you might want

1451
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,530
to say okay what are the indicators and

1452
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:30,230
then you go okay great we have that

1453
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:32,660
question we know our method machine

1454
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:35,810
learning we need our data there are no

1455
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:38,630
data sources for bug bounties so you

1456
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:41,030
need a lot of data to do machine

1457
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,970
learning so much data now if you're

1458
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,310
perhaps running a program and you get

1459
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,590
you know thousands of reports you might

1460
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:51,440
be able to answer that question when it

1461
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,970
revolves around what books are we likely

1462
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:55,610
to find if you're on the other side you

1463
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:59,420
can't really have the data to access it

1464
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,550
a lot of the times those kind of active

1465
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:04,430
scanners they use pattern recognition so

1466
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,490
they're looking for kind of that

1467
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:08,990
basically going through this thing going

1468
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,050
does it have there

1469
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:12,450
it might be vulnerable to that etc etc

1470
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:19,130
so on that side you've got these kind of

1471
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:21,720
rule-based if you like approaches to the

1472
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,650
problem on the other side you have AI

1473
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:28,790
and AI needs data and there is no data

1474
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:31,050
don't worry about taking your jobs

1475
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,420
because they don't have to data to be

1476
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,490
able to do it that's their weakness that

1477
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,200
Skynet's weakness and take away the data

1478
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,410
they can't steal your job I mean that's

1479
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:42,990
if you exclude Twitter you know trying

1480
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,960
to teach us what news is and isn't but

1481
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:52,800
yes otherwise I brought yeah no

1482
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,810
absolutely I agree that was a great

1483
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:55,230
answer

1484
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,760
um follow-on question to that you know

1485
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,020
researchers hackers you know people that

1486
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,700
are in cybersecurity that are wanting

1487
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,860
because from my person and I actually

1488
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,350
had a Twitter exchange on this um the

1489
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,060
other day it's like AI means that does

1490
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:12,120
there's more to hack you know in terms

1491
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,960
of actually learning how to think about

1492
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,430
machine learning and AI as an

1493
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:19,410
opportunity to differentiate as a bounty

1494
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:22,890
hunter what are your thoughts on that oh

1495
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:26,340
my god I have any thoughts on this so we

1496
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,260
makes machine learning kinda interesting

1497
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,470
is as like talk to our bounty

1498
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,690
perspective is that there are a lot of

1499
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:36,060
bugs that just haven't been explored

1500
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,610
completely I take before the machine

1501
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:41,070
learning wise in a lot of data if you

1502
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,870
give it a lot more data you can trick it

1503
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:46,050
essentially and that might have a lot of

1504
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:48,990
security impact if you can give false

1505
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:51,840
data you can produce false results which

1506
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,120
can then go into you know at marketing

1507
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,520
board meeting and that can really damage

1508
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,070
a company's reputation and that's the

1509
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:03,300
type of security impact so if you want

1510
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,940
to learn more and there's definitely

1511
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,710
stuff to look there's so much to learn

1512
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,860
especially because data size doesn't

1513
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,570
necessarily get the same scrutiny as

1514
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:14,670
developers do yet

1515
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:17,250
we get away with a lot more but if you

1516
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,020
want to learn it I really recommend data

1517
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:23,790
cap so data camp is kind of it's the pen

1518
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,500
yes the lab pro for data science

1519
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,940
practical exercises that get you working

1520
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,160
with the algorithms they get you

1521
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,960
understanding the results and actually

1522
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,850
teaching you how to interpret results if

1523
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:37,920
you're interested in machine learning I

1524
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,470
highly recommend doing that although bug

1525
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,510
I'm gonna be doing some videos on it

1526
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:45,030
because I think it's interesting and

1527
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,800
it's my youtube channel and I could do

1528
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,280
what I want

1529
01:04:51,570 --> 01:05:03,419
