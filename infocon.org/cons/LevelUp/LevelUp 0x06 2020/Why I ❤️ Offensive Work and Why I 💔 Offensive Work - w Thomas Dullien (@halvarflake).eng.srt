[Music]

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,940
and you know I'll take I'll take this is

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,559
the opportunity to introduce the next

4
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,650
talk which is I'm honored to have this

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,429
this guy as a part of level up you have

6
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,259
been been following him and his work for

7
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:27,470
for a long time you know Tomas DeLeon or

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,720
halvah flake is he's he's known in the

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,410
in the cybers has an incredible history

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,719
in insecurity right across the board

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,239
he's worked on the offensive side he's

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,949
worked on the offensive decent defense

13
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:41,690
side in project zero

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,269
he's now actually doing a pretty amazing

15
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:47,109
startup that just got funded around

16
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:49,010
infrastructure and all sorts of fun

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,929
things like that but he's got an

18
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:53,739
incredible view he's done some amazing

19
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,879
pwnage over the years he's got an

20
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,469
incredible viewpoint on security and his

21
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:59,570
talk today is it's really about his

22
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,480
experience and his view on that overall

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,819
space so I think without further ado

24
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,380
what do you reckon guys let's let's kick

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,680
this thing off super excited hit it

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,300
let's go thank you very much Thomas

27
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,270
direction and great been here I guess

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,310
I'll start sharing the screen and show

29
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,280
some slides here all right good day

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,700
everybody

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,300
yeah so this is a bit of a strange

32
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,340
strange table for me to give because

33
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,100
they're doing security for quite a while

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,970
now it's been 20 plus years 23 on the

35
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,860
order off and 1/2 years ago I decided to

36
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,660
do something else for a change which I

37
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,700
was surprisingly successful at and then

38
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,950
I haven't actually done any security

39
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,870
work or thought about security work in

40
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,210
the technical sense in 1/2 years so it's

41
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,040
a similar strange experience to give a

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,040
talk to a security audience while

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,990
actively avoiding thinking about

44
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,510
security during my day and the talk

45
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,610
itself is titled why I love offensive

46
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,380
work and why I don't love offensive work

47
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,690
and with the subtitle of confessions of

48
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,490
a recovering bones earth and I think the

49
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,008
summary is if you do something for a

50
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,470
very long time you get to know what

51
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,610
you're doing

52
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,770
quite some detail and you develop all

53
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,420
sorts of very well profound thoughts and

54
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,850
emotions around the topic and this talk

55
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,920
tries to summarize my my thoughts and

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,840
emotions around security which I love

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,310
which I sometimes don't love so I'll get

58
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,160
started here am how you get there yeah

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,750
you got it I was just gonna call out the

60
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,620
window left okay so yeah the thing

61
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,430
really is that I talked about in this

62
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,230
talk is a bit what I would ramble about

63
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,570
over beers with friends and at some

64
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,220
point I decide to just put that into a

65
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,810
presentation because rambling with

66
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,270
friends doesn't really scale and I guess

67
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,830
this will be the closest approximation I

68
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,630
think it'd be with me and listen to me

69
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,160
ramble for a while so to begin the talk

70
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,709
it's actually important to know a little

71
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,959
bit about my personality a friend I

72
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,239
worked with for a long time at one point

73
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,020
asked me I Thomas isn't really stressed

74
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,540
to have a love/hate relationship with

75
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,049
quite literally everything and while

76
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,820
this isn't precisely true there's a few

77
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,440
things that are on ambiguously like and

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,459
there's a few things that are on them

79
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,080
because we just like it is true that

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,430
I've got a complex relationship with

81
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,709
quite a few topics and security

82
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,630
particularly offensive where I go both

83
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,370
really both offensive and defensive work

84
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,620
is a complex topic and I've got very

85
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,100
complex feelings about it and I'll recap

86
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,350
with complex feelings but given that

87
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,200
this is a very subjective very personal

88
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,540
view I'm sure people will disagree and I

89
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,519
well I don't blame you if you don't

90
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,799
agree with the things I'm saying all

91
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,980
right so let me start with I think it's

92
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,570
about 10 reasons why I really love

93
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,140
offensive work and there's many of them

94
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,519
there's technical reasons there's

95
00:03:58,519 --> 00:03:59,810
economic reasons and there's emotional

96
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,120
reasons and I'll go through them one by

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,600
one there may be more than these ten but

98
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,450
10 a such nice number so the first

99
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,790
reason why I really love offensive work

100
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,060
is if there's ever been any job in in

101
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,339
computing that is really full stack but

102
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,630
people talk about full second to hearing

103
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,279
and so forth but the only job that's

104
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,029
really full stack

105
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,520
is almost the only job is security

106
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,220
security offensive research spends all

107
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,680
layers of security from the very low low

108
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,510
level in terms of how is the hardware

109
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,560
implemented what happens to the

110
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,810
transistors in your RAM how do you

111
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,620
extract firmware from the device through

112
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,210
all the firmware through the software

113
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,530
through the operating system through the

114
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,300
language one times for the language

115
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,000
libraries through the higher orders

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,410
software implementation through the

117
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,320
higher order software logic and then at

118
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,490
the very top end is the actual

119
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,990
interaction with users where you're at

120
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,540
the level of phishing credible phishing

121
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,150
emails homer glyph attacks and so forth

122
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,060
so you're literally going from the very

123
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,770
top which is the perceptual layer the

124
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,700
emotional layer with which people

125
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,440
interact with software all the way down

126
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,140
to electrons flipping around in some

127
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,169
silicon and issues with the physics of

128
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:12,000
the the manufacturing process for CPUs

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,610
and all of that is fair game and for

130
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,290
somebody who loves nothing more than

131
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,120
learning stuff this is beautiful because

132
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,190
there's just no area of computer science

133
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,020
that you need to avoid because it's not

134
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,720
part of your or your topic and then it

135
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,940
comes to the actual engineering there's

136
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,830
so much good really interesting software

137
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,340
like for the theoretically and and proof

138
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,770
inclined the static analysis program

139
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,390
analysis abstract interpretation all

140
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,039
these things there's a lot of really

141
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,600
clever systems engineering that you need

142
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,220
to do in order to do security but if you

143
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,620
look at something like AFL if as a bunch

144
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,360
of good ideas but some of those or most

145
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,950
of those ideas existed beforehand and

146
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,140
what really set AFL apart from the

147
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,060
fuzzes that came beforehand was it was

148
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,050
really well engineered it just worked so

149
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,729
and if you're on a dodge fossa farm

150
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,350
you're in a similar situation we

151
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,310
actually have to do large-scale

152
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,260
engineering and then there's a lot of

153
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,820
super interesting systems in terms you

154
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,430
need to be aware of anything involving

155
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,080
local privilege escalation exports

156
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,419
kernel bugs it's just a lot of beautiful

157
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,390
well detail that's that very few people

158
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,210
ever really understand and appreciate

159
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,140
there's cryptography for the

160
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,570
mathematically inclined I me as a

161
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,400
mathematician I like that area quite a

162
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,520
bit even I was never very good at it

163
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,030
there's a lot of runtime analysis stuff

164
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,740
like coverage analysis dynamic binary

165
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,139
instrumentation

166
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,330
they're never been analyzing stuff by

167
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,819
injecting JavaScript and then there's a

168
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,589
lot of really interesting work with data

169
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:41,629
structures and algorithms in the sense

170
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:43,909
that very few people ever interact with

171
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,889
data structures at the level that

172
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,330
somebody that writes a complicated heap

173
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,909
exploit has to because people understand

174
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,469
yeah link list but very few people

175
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:53,779
understand hey I've got a b-tree and now

176
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,459
one of the pointers of the B tree is

177
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:57,229
corrupted in this strange manner but I

178
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,059
still need to be able to insert at least

179
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:01,689
five times for my exploit to work and

180
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:05,149
you can argue that like it's very rare

181
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,830
for anybody to ever interact with so

182
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,270
many different data structures but at a

183
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,339
similarly deep level like the the

184
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,649
offensive researcher and then there's

185
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,520
also the aspect of exploring archaeology

186
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,949
in the ruins of your elders in the sense

187
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,680
that software lives for a long time a

188
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,110
lot of offensive work is really about

189
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,930
descending into the path of a software

190
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,149
stack that nobody's looked at in a few

191
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,939
years the joke is we build our software

192
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:33,499
like we build our cities on the the

193
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:34,879
ruins of the trash of the previous

194
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,819
generations and below the surface layer

195
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,379
all of that is still there and that's

196
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:40,909
quite true like if you if you look at

197
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,580
stuff like parts of puzzle buttons or to

198
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,229
drop font bugs in the world in the

199
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:48,259
Windows kernel that code is 2530 years

200
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,490
old in some incarnation so I've always

201
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,649
enjoyed this digging into the history

202
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,559
aspect of it as well so the the first

203
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:00,110
slide is it is the most full stack

204
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,519
computer science I know about um a

205
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,009
second reason why really not offensive

206
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,769
work is the creativity I used to teach

207
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:12,649
classes training starters for how to

208
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:15,559
find bugs and how to write exploits and

209
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:18,050
I always likens the process of writing

210
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,159
an exploit - when you're auditing code

211
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:23,990
you find all these small bugs that have

212
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,669
weird implications and it's a bit like

213
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:27,919
getting a random assortment of arts from

214
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,139
the IKEA warehouse and your goal is to

215
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,610
eventually build a chair of all these

216
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,078
random cars that are really not designed

217
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,599
to fit together and there's that's an

218
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,458
inherently very creative process because

219
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,019
you're programming and building

220
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,818
something out of parts that haven't been

221
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:42,828
designed to be programmable and haven't

222
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:44,750
been designed to fit together so there's

223
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,529
a tremendous

224
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,870
amount of inventiveness and a tremendous

225
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,220
amount of accomplishment when you get

226
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,199
something to work because most modern

227
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,959
exploits are Rube Goldberg machines that

228
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,810
by any reasonable like in any reasonable

229
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,149
world they wouldn't work but they do and

230
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,420
it's it's a beauty another thing I

231
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,540
really love about offensive work is that

232
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,459
you're actually playing on the

233
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,620
scientific frontiers of theoretical

234
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,110
computer science we have very very

235
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,920
little depth in our understanding of

236
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,870
what an exploit actually is and I

237
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,029
actually spent a good chunk of a

238
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,800
year-long sabbatical trying to write

239
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,870
down better theoretical understanding of

240
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,910
what I'm doing when I'm doing this stuff

241
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,230
and the the beauty there is that it

242
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,439
isn't so often that you work on

243
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,970
fundamental theoretical computer science

244
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,059
problems in your life and if you

245
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,559
understand something well and you manage

246
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:42,559
to to write it down properly you may be

247
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,149
working on something that survives the

248
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,430
next 30 40 years of humanity's

249
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,990
understanding of what computing is all

250
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,449
about so that's exciting for me as well

251
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:55,399
another thing I really like is its

252
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,519
inherently practical my my studies where

253
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,129
in mathematics and particularly in

254
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:03,379
symmetric cryptography and in that field

255
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:05,449
you can hardly ever see the results

256
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,220
meaning the result of your work is a

257
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,410
paper where you show that you can lower

258
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,209
the complexity of an attack from 2 to

259
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,550
the power of 128 to 2 to the power of

260
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,399
110 but nobody can ever validate whether

261
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,220
it's actually true because nobody has to

262
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,439
to the power of 110 computer to test

263
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:22,639
whether what you're claiming is correct

264
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,709
and that leads to through all sorts of

265
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,189
badness where incorrect results get

266
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:29,449
published and then you try to reproduce

267
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:31,459
even parts of it and not that works and

268
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:34,610
the paper that has the worst bugs in it

269
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,529
because the estimates were all too

270
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:38,089
optimistic gets the most citations and

271
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:42,410
so forth and so forth and from a

272
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,540
personality structure I really like the

273
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,029
practical effects I really like that the

274
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,970
like to see my work do what it's

275
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,769
supposed to do and you can argue that

276
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:54,769
offensive offensive work there's a bit

277
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:56,509
of an outlier in the security product

278
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:57,800
industry because

279
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,450
he product industry is full of products

280
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,709
that don't necessarily do what they

281
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:03,260
advertise and the the offensive product

282
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,529
industry can be argued that they

283
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:08,330
actually produce things that reliably do

284
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,580
what they advertise with that's good or

285
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,190
bad is a different story later but they

286
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,420
do work and that's satisfying

287
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,620
another thing that's that's positive

288
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,800
about the offensive work is that it has

289
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,860
great incentive alignment in the sense

290
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,350
that your success is pretty objectively

291
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,899
measurable and discreet either you get

292
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,040
the route show or you don't know either

293
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,690
you or you get code execution or you

294
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,589
don't and there's a strong correlation

295
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:38,360
between the technical excellence and

296
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,640
income generation because it technically

297
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,140
excellences or like if you're technical

298
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,990
contributions directly measurable it's

299
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,769
it's strongly correlated and it sounds

300
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,600
weird but this is actually rare one of

301
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,690
the the lies we tell to children is that

302
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,700
and it's a good lie to tell to children

303
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,110
but one of the lies we tell to children

304
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,050
is that the level of skill in a

305
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,970
particular area is correlated to your

306
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,399
future income and it turns out this is

307
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,110
actually pretty rare like in most

308
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,700
industries that is not true and it's one

309
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,930
of the things I like about security

310
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,459
where it's at least on that side

311
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,140
somewhere there are quite a meritocratic

312
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,880
or more meritocratic them than many

313
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,649
other fields because you've got such a

314
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,630
such a clear measure of whether what

315
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,870
you've done actually works there's also

316
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,430
the part where your opponent's the

317
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,680
software vendor actually doesn't care

318
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,899
that much about fighting you they care

319
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:32,260
about wide adoption of their software

320
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,300
and in some sense the offensive player

321
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,950
and the defensive player have the

322
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,779
incentives of mind if the sense that

323
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:41,540
zoom cares more or any any other stuff

324
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,800
up and that cares more about the next

325
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,449
hundred million users and they care

326
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:46,970
about fixing an overflow which means if

327
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,500
you have an o day in something that is

328
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,959
growing rapidly your interest in their

329
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,220
interest are at least aligned because

330
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,870
your owner gets more relevant as they

331
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,120
grow there's also a part where all

332
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,870
offensive technical problems are

333
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,920
technical problems

334
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,560
meaning

335
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,960
especially security a lot of the the

336
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,960
offensive work is very much just a

337
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,250
technical problem and then a lot of a

338
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,990
defensive work is quite political

339
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,850
because you have to get organizations to

340
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,350
change their processes you get

341
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,940
organizations to spend their money

342
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,540
differently and so forth that leads to

343
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,850
an incentive structure where a lot of

344
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,770
the people whose passion is the

345
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,140
technical problem-solving gravitate

346
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,140
towards the offensive site so if your

347
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,760
your inclination is technical

348
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,210
problem-solving offensive work is a

349
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,850
great playground because that's where

350
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,260
the technical purely technical

351
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,279
problem-solving gets rewarded

352
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,690
another thing that's that's nice about

353
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,510
offensive work is that as an offensive

354
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,279
vendor you're actually mission critical

355
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,430
for your customers in the sense that's

356
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,040
from a from a monetary or from a market

357
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,220
perspective the most important products

358
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,110
are the best products and the best most

359
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,730
important jobs are those that are

360
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,990
mission critical for the customers

361
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,240
meaning if you don't do your job the

362
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,810
customer can't do their job and that's

363
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,730
good from a financial perspective

364
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,900
because the customer will buy your

365
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,010
product otherwise they can't do their

366
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,780
job but also it's good for you because

367
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,630
it keeps you honest and the the reality

368
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,180
is that most security products in the

369
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,490
market are nice to have most businesses

370
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,460
can continue without running a navy and

371
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,370
so forth and this leads to a situation

372
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,020
where a lot of defensive security

373
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,140
products are sales driven because if

374
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,540
what you're selling isn't strictly

375
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,430
necessary for the client you need to

376
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,040
convince the client and that's why well

377
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,540
there's a lot of salespeople and there's

378
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,250
also why we have RSA as a security

379
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,589
conference because given the importance

380
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:46,540
of sales in the security product market

381
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,330
you get these conferences which are very

382
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,390
sales heavy and very non-technical in

383
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,810
some sense so offensive security is

384
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,400
mission-critical for the customers that

385
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,170
actually buy these things and that

386
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,820
greatly reduces the need to explain to

387
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,650
the customer why they would want to buy

388
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:07,900
it another economic reason why offensive

389
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,089
security is actually really interesting

390
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:14,270
is in a strange way the person that buys

391
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,670
the software isn't spending their own

392
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,130
money what I mean with this is in this

393
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,360
diagram you know on the far left side

394
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,850
we've got the device vendor and the

395
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,980
device vendor let's let's say the device

396
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,460
Apple Google Samsung whatever I said

397
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,830
they make creating an attack on their

398
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,320
device harder or more expensive by

399
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,450
hardening things then the offensive

400
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,640
vendor has to spend more money on on

401
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,620
breaking into the thing and building an

402
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,260
exploit for it so they go to their

403
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,060
customers which are the law enforcement

404
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,070
agencies and intelligence agencies of

405
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,560
various countries and they say we need

406
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,810
more money to do our job and then the

407
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,160
law enforcement agency we need seats

408
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,649
which are the customers they go to their

409
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:56,480
boss which are in the other politicians

410
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,550
and they say dear politicians we need

411
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,709
more money to do our job keeping you

412
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,529
safe and then the politicians ask their

413
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,350
population do you want to feel safe and

414
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,820
the politician over the population by a

415
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,290
large votes for the politicians that

416
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,459
makes them feel safe and then the

417
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:12,050
politicians get to tax the population

418
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,970
and take their money and then all that

419
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,790
money gets funneled through this diagram

420
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,890
back to the offensive vendor which means

421
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,839
that in some bizarre sense the offensive

422
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,209
researcher manages to be a tax on the

423
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,730
population and I mean if your business

424
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,060
is a tax if you're able of taxing

425
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,770
capable taxing a population that's a

426
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,640
very profitable place to be so yeah it's

427
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,339
a strange really strange industry in

428
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:42,110
that sense now on to the very personal

429
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,350
and emotional things why I love

430
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,779
offensive work the high after success is

431
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:50,209
really really great I had a math

432
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,250
professor that once said that the joy in

433
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,990
mathematics is often the receding of the

434
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,310
pain because he was smash your head

435
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,630
against the problem for ages and then

436
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,279
all of a sudden it clicks and you get

437
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,390
through and at least for me working on a

438
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,620
difficult problem and finding a solution

439
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,559
is super gratifying I just like very few

440
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,530
things make me happier than then working

441
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,059
on something that's really hard and then

442
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:15,410
getting somewhere and offensive work is

443
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,240
very very different from a lot of other

444
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,920
work because you have very long periods

445
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,959
of very little success and then a very

446
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,750
sudden jump to a solution and that's

447
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,189
quite different for example from

448
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:26,929
software development with a very gradual

449
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:27,770
improvement

450
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,309
and never quite the big job and this the

451
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:33,910
sudden jump from nothing to everything

452
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,500
is very intense emotionally and very

453
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,220
addictive I can still remember few

454
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,540
situations in my life I can still

455
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,309
remember the high from a few bugs I

456
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:46,610
found in a few exports I got working and

457
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,910
that's that's in itself quite quite

458
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,790
addictive so I definitely love love that

459
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,450
hiring um another thing I really love

460
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,270
about exploitation is that it's the

461
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,510
closest thing to real world magic like

462
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,100
if you if you think about what happens

463
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,110
in a really high-level is you've got

464
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,420
this terribly complicated device like

465
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,330
the computer the phone whatever and

466
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,000
there's like literally hundreds of

467
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,250
thousands of man days and work in there

468
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,679
like the like Windows Windows XP already

469
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:20,870
had more man-hours committed to that the

470
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,940
premise of keys a alright so you've got

471
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,040
this thing where many many people worked

472
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,540
for many years it's tremendously

473
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,150
complicated and then you scare it and

474
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,800
you figure out the right incantation to

475
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,050
utter at the device and then you you've

476
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,940
sent that incantation over the wire and

477
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,410
you gain remote control off the device

478
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,670
and watching an exploit work properly

479
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,559
even today after more than 20 years it

480
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,510
always feels like a magic spell it's

481
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,990
it's and it's it's we don't have many

482
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,059
other analogies in this world where you

483
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,890
walk up to a car and you say a magic

484
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,140
spell and now you control the car so

485
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,860
that's just just a real trip and then

486
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,030
the reason number 10 security used to be

487
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,880
such a strange backwater and within

488
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,100
within that backwater that offensive

489
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,620
security was even even more of a

490
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,580
backwater and at least from from like

491
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,710
when I started economic motivations were

492
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,090
in part of it because everybody told you

493
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,559
you're crazy - insecurity there's more

494
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,970
money in security what are you doing

495
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,450
quit wasting your time so the people you

496
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,770
met were either motivated by the

497
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,870
curiosity and Southen were motivated by

498
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,330
the sense of duty and it created this

499
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,690
really interesting community of misfits

500
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,880
a lot of autodidact Slyke people that

501
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,690
taught themselves

502
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,300
and it wasn't or it still is a community

503
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,980
where where you have people that never

504
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,870
finished high school debating or

505
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,280
discussing technical issues with people

506
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,020
that finish their PhD in math from a

507
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,190
great university and they're all on one

508
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,680
level in that sense and the community

509
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,050
has very very unique personalities with

510
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,290
very unique mutant powers a friend of me

511
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,720
of mine and me we sometimes played the

512
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,500
game we try to cast Hollywood actors to

513
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,550
represent the different personalities we

514
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,770
met in our security careers and you just

515
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,050
run out of strange actors really quickly

516
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,900
because the reality is that the security

517
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,540
community is full of such fascinating

518
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,700
personalities that you just can't can't

519
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,640
fill all those roles so I really and I

520
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,510
really like the that community of of

521
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,670
misfits in some sense okay after gushing

522
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,890
and fuzzy a Stickley about offensive

523
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,550
security I will take you on two or three

524
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,430
detours in terms of the topic and ramble

525
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,370
around about some that's almost entirely

526
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,880
unrelated and the first detour on which

527
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,500
I'm going to take you is one about

528
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,830
science and conflict and the question of

529
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,110
to what extent can you do science

530
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:01,230
without helping warfare and the

531
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,210
background to this is so first of all I

532
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,850
perceive myself to be a scientist or /

533
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,820
engineer of sorts and when I was young I

534
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,740
read like as a teenager I read film

535
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,210
what's the physicists and I watched a

536
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,240
play called Copenhagen and both books

537
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,850
are both both a book and to play our

538
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,260
exploring science warfare and the

539
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,000
implications if you if you have the

540
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,370
chance of you work in security they're

541
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,380
worth looking out for the physicist sir

542
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,990
is great and Magnus great as well and

543
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,080
they they look at the Manhattan Project

544
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,180
and the the implications they offer at

545
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,130
some level and I won't talk too much

546
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,920
about them here um but I was always

547
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,550
worried about essentially making my

548
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,080
living living via serving well getting

549
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,610
money from military strategy alters

550
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,950
budgets from about 2000 onwards

551
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,529
I financed my my university years by

552
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,659
giving trainings to military

553
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,690
intelligence folks about finding bugs

554
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,179
writing exploits and so forth and for me

555
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:07,860
coming from a very pacifist non-military

556
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,750
immediate family even though my wider

557
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,799
family it is not quite that that was

558
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,970
always weird for me and as a 14-year old

559
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,419
I also listened to a band called prodigy

560
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:22,820
there's a famous symbol that they play

561
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,370
how like how can I prevent one's work

562
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,600
falling into the wrong hands

563
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,539
so it wasn't always a question for me to

564
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,909
what extent am i involved in warfare and

565
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:36,360
killing people and there's a fascinating

566
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,090
book called a mathematicians apology by

567
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,460
a mathematician called Hardy where he'd

568
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,950
be moans and and complains rightfully

569
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:50,580
about the fact that the military took

570
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,980
over so much of the scientific

571
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,330
establishment between the First World

572
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,360
War and the Second World War and how so

573
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,279
much of signs have been militarized in

574
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,399
some say in some way and in this book

575
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:05,279
though he writes that at least when you

576
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,929
do mathematics it's not a problem

577
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,120
because no one has yet discovered any

578
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,409
warlike purpose to be served by the

579
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:12,110
theory of numbers or relativity

580
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,340
theoretical physics and seems unlikely

581
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,289
that anyone will do so for many years

582
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:19,409
and this was published in 1940 and five

583
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:21,210
years later the theory of relativity and

584
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,130
theoretical physics physics were used

585
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,020
for the first nuclear bomb and then a

586
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,000
couple years later Clifford Cox at GHQ

587
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,669
invented RSA like cryptography in 1973

588
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:33,260
so the reality is that Hardy was

589
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,730
steadily wrong about his prediction that

590
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,830
certain pieces of science cannot be used

591
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,710
for war and that's something to think

592
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,529
about

593
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:45,870
there's a second example I dated a

594
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,059
social anthropologist in the early 2000s

595
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,580
and she constantly and rightfully made

596
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,289
fun of the fact that both mathematics

597
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:53,399
and computer science were thoroughly

598
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,929
militarized disciplines in the sense

599
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:56,730
that so much funding was coming from

600
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,429
DARPA and I made my living training

601
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:01,679
these people and so forth and then in

602
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,649
2007 Secretary of Defense gates when he

603
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:06,440
got appointed the first thing he did

604
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,610
try to get to grips with Iraq ones start

605
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,419
something called the Human Terrain

606
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:14,029
system where the DoD started recruiting

607
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,600
anthropologists like Matt to improve the

608
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,159
the warfare capabilities in Iraq and

609
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,080
unravel the tribal structure and so

610
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,720
forth and what this tells you is that it

611
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,669
may be difficult to make a distinction

612
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,149
between peaceful and warlike science it

613
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:34,460
may be that for most of science your

614
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,320
choice isn't between peaceful and

615
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,450
warlike your choice is between relevant

616
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,850
and irrelevant and it may be that the

617
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,679
only way of preventing your scientific

618
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,720
outputs from being used by the

619
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,659
militaries of a war is to make it make

620
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:49,750
sure it's irrelevant or wrong or both

621
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,809
because if if whatever you do can give

622
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:56,149
one side an advantage they will try to

623
00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:01,970
use it so what this means is there is no

624
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,370
such thing as or almost never a thing

625
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,710
like warlike or peaceful research as

626
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,750
such but that doesn't mean that you

627
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,309
don't have a responsibility to judge

628
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,950
what you're working on I mean in the

629
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,159
current covert situation I'm quite sure

630
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,700
that this drives home that for example

631
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,350
research on biological weapons is most

632
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,259
likely not a good thing to work on

633
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:28,700
anyhow after this first detour talking

634
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,600
about science technology and and war

635
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,009
I'll have a little bit more of a chat

636
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:36,620
about the question of to what extent is

637
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,200
it immoral to improve weaponry that's a

638
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,789
strange question to ask that's through

639
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:46,250
like one of the things I don't like in

640
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,690
the discussion about offensive tooling

641
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,259
is often the comparison to weapons and I

642
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,389
thought like we do between exports and

643
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:54,919
weapons which is a terrible comparison

644
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,080
to begin with but through that

645
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,600
comparison I've started thinking about

646
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,549
what are the moral implications of

647
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:04,250
working on improved weaponry if if they

648
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,580
like if I was to work on weaponry it's

649
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,159
interesting because people usually say

650
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,629
ok working on better weapons is

651
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:15,080
inherently morally bad then in 2016 I

652
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,269
visited Japan both Hashima and

653
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:20,419
Tanegashima so I would not

654
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:23,600
talk about hiroshima Hiroshima is

655
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,609
something that everybody that works in

656
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:29,119
security and has out of the word cyber

657
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,190
war should visit at one point of their

658
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,679
lives because it's deeply impressive but

659
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,210
there's no way I couldn't convey any of

660
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,799
that here so I will just not talk about

661
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:37,210
it

662
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,929
Tanegashima is what I'll talk about

663
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:41,059
Tanegashima is an island in the south of

664
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:43,669
Japan and telugu sheela is historically

665
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:48,019
one of them because it's how guns first

666
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:50,889
came to Japan what happens is that in

667
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:52,039
1467

668
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,739
Japan's feudal system collapsed and then

669
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,019
a period called sangoku started and it

670
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,629
was permanent internal warfare no side

671
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:00,919
could get an upper hand and entire

672
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,749
generations of young men died in battle

673
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:05,679
with swords all the time and then

674
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,710
seventy-six years later the first gun

675
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,019
arrives in Japan via Tanegashima because

676
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:13,519
a group of pirates essentially were

677
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,859
adventurous as they were called wash

678
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:19,039
ashore after typhoon on that island and

679
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,210
they'd trade a gun against having their

680
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,519
boat repaired with a local warlord

681
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,499
so they provide this gun to the world

682
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:29,509
local warlord and the local warlords and

683
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:33,259
figures out how to cruise guns and they

684
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:36,769
get adopted by the Japanese forces like

685
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:39,019
by by some Japanese forces and then they

686
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:42,769
changed warfare deeply and the war ends

687
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:46,399
reasonably quickly so you had a 100-plus

688
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,830
year period of permanent warfare and

689
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,629
that ended within 40 years after the

690
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,789
introduction of the first gun so in a

691
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:55,489
very very bizarre way superior weaponry

692
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:58,480
created peace by breaking the stalemate

693
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,759
that was just killing people over and

694
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:07,580
over again and the lesson I took from

695
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,450
this is that guns or better weaponry on

696
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,950
one side is one thing but what's really

697
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,659
terrible for everybody is prolonged

698
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,580
warfare where there's a stalemate that

699
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,830
just kills people on all sides all the

700
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,639
time and some people would even argue

701
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:25,519
that the terribleness of nuclear weapons

702
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,220
is what enabled some of the the peace

703
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,059
that came at least in Europe and the

704
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:33,660
u.s. from

705
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,400
like 1945 to today so I personally don't

706
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,190
have an answer to the question or with a

707
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,920
better weaponry is bad on what

708
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,540
but Tanegashima is something that I

709
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,460
think about a lot the picture on the

710
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,560
right hand side by the way is from the

711
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,440
Tanegashima gun museum and you can see

712
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,180
that they experimented with a lot of

713
00:28:54,180 --> 00:29:00,720
really crazy calibers and gun shapes the

714
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,390
long story short is I don't have a good

715
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,370
answer and there is current examples as

716
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,720
well when like if you look at New

717
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,100
Zealand when guns arrived in New Zealand

718
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,130
the Maori which have been in fairly non

719
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,170
deadly warfare with each other all the

720
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,290
time engaged enthusiastically in gun

721
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,970
battles and was very deadly for them and

722
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,470
then it's also interesting to see that

723
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,020
Japan D armed itself afterwards like

724
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,380
once they achieve peace they essentially

725
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,110
removed our guns again and even forgot

726
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,910
how to make them which is fascinating

727
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,940
because it's a country that simply gave

728
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,700
up the manufacturing of weaponry and

729
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,100
reverting to the sword over a period of

730
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,770
several hundred years which is not

731
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,860
something that I think has much

732
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,500
precedent elsewhere anyhow I have no

733
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,850
idea what the lesson from all this is

734
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,580
really except that the statement weapons

735
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,220
are always net bad is too simplistic and

736
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,750
anybody that tells you this isn't

737
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,550
engaging with the topic in very

738
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:03,630
sophisticated manner um detailer number

739
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,990
three fragility of democracies with a

740
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,640
subtitle of hundred years without death

741
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,430
schools deaf sports question mark now

742
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,160
after many years working in security

743
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,950
since my teens I took a sabbatical from

744
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,080
2015 to 2016 with my wife and we

745
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,570
traveled around the world to various

746
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,200
countries and I didn't realize this when

747
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,630
I started the travel and the travel was

748
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,220
easily scheduled by where can we go to

749
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,370
surf and then I traveled and through

750
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,590
those travels it turned out that pretty

751
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,990
much every place we visited at living

752
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,640
memory of death squads going around

753
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,350
killing people and this is something

754
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:47,129
that I don't think I had

755
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:50,110
understood at the proper level of depth

756
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,899
beforehand and examples II like it so

757
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:55,360
it's important to mention I'm German by

758
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,850
birth and upbringing so I won't even

759
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,009
mention on the slide what needs to be

760
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:01,149
mentioned which is the German death

761
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:02,590
squads and the atrocities committed by

762
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:08,679
the Germans in the 30s and film and so I

763
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:10,330
was very aware of that but then wherever

764
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,460
I traveled I found that that country had

765
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,169
a similar history in living memory and

766
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:16,779
on atsume history had death squads in

767
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:18,730
living memory there's no service tree

768
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,830
when it comes to the German situation

769
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:24,879
anyhow so an example would be France in

770
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:27,159
the during independence war they killed

771
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:28,600
people and they pioneered a technique

772
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,700
that was later on perfected in Argentina

773
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,200
which was called death rites where you

774
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,490
simply took the people you wanted to

775
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,649
disappear onto an airplane and you fly

776
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:38,649
over the ocean and you drop them Morocco

777
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:41,110
had 700 people first disappeared on a

778
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,999
king hassan ii and assassinated people

779
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:46,389
in paris Uruguay had 20% of the

780
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:48,129
population arrested at one point under

781
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:51,659
the dictatorship on more than 180 killed

782
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,639
Argentina disappeared in quotation marks

783
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:57,100
between 9,000 and 30,000 people and that

784
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:02,340
has not been fully fully worked through

785
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,009
today South Africa had death squads

786
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:09,929
during the struggle against apartheid

787
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:13,240
Portugal had murders on Salazar Spain

788
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,799
had between a hundred and two hundred

789
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,149
thousand deaths in the white terror

790
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:18,610
under Franco and then a hundred thousand

791
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,789
more that disappeared and then so years

792
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:23,289
Taiwan never our own blood patriots and

793
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:23,830
so forth

794
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,190
so pretty much almost everywhere you

795
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,889
have people that are still alive that

796
00:32:29,889 --> 00:32:31,990
live through a period of death Scott's

797
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,029
going around killing people but

798
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:35,529
something you have to be very aware of

799
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:40,090
and the take away from me in 2016 was

800
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,679
that democracy and basic rights are

801
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,139
extremely fragile and then not the norm

802
00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:48,279
I sometimes quipped that every democracy

803
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,049
is to terror strikes at one opportunist

804
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:52,899
away from dictatorship and that's

805
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:57,178
important to keep in mind like we

806
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,460
well like just empirically

807
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,870
state-sponsored death squads happen with

808
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,580
some regularity a fairly regular

809
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,950
intervals about every 100 years or so in

810
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,760
most countries here you have and it's

811
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,080
important to keep in mind that most of

812
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,280
us have grown up in an unusually

813
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,830
peaceful time in an unusually peaceful

814
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,510
part of the world but all of us but most

815
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,520
of us and it's important to be conscious

816
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,690
of that because it buys us your

817
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,160
decision-making because you

818
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,710
underestimate the risk of society

819
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,560
reverting to a non democracy rights

820
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,820
going out of the window and people

821
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,040
getting killed and honestly and just

822
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,020
disappeared again like that's something

823
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,640
that can happen okay let's get to the

824
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,930
reasons why I do not love offensive work

825
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,190
there's many reasons to not love

826
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,380
offensive work and there's Society of

827
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,790
reasons there's emotional reasons and

828
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,660
there's even technical reasons and the

829
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,780
the very first one is very interesting

830
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,540
for me because I I met Robert Morris

831
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,400
senior at some point I think it must

832
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,080
have been 2003 or 2004 and brought

833
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,630
Marcia is the father of Bob Morris Julia

834
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,040
who's the author of the first real

835
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,960
Internet were the Rob Morris here was

836
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,760
also the head scientists of NSA and to

837
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,320
some extent he's the grandfather of

838
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,679
hacking in some sense and he's a bit of

839
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,418
an eye I doff my no he was a bit of an

840
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:22,300
idol of mine and then when I met him he

841
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,130
asked me what I do and I said I study

842
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,850
mathematics and his reply was for whom

843
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,500
and I found this for whom to be a really

844
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,690
strange thing to ask because I I was

845
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,389
studying mathematics at university and

846
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,889
didn't really think about for whom at

847
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:40,090
all and in a bizarre twist of fate that

848
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:42,100
question became the haunting question of

849
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,530
my security career because all of

850
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,810
security is fundamentally about human

851
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,090
power and human conflict you are always

852
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,340
on the side of somebody you always pick

853
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,300
a side and interestingly and but sadly

854
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,850
both defensive on offense and defensive

855
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,980
security tend to be on the side of the

856
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,980
already powerful because if you want to

857
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,720
get paid for what you're doing you have

858
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,190
to work for somebody that can pay you

859
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,569
which tends to be if they already path

860
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:12,660
and what happened to me over those 25

861
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,220
years or 24 years or 23 years was I

862
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,380
incrementally ran out of sides I like to

863
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,960
pick meaning I've got a pick a side and

864
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,150
I don't know anymore which side I

865
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,780
actually want to be on for the most part

866
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:31,369
so that's a bit of a strange one a

867
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:35,210
second reason that I find difficult with

868
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,640
with security is that the different

869
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,010
career paths in security all have their

870
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,109
the particular pros and cons and the

871
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:45,720
particular downsizing outsides and

872
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,250
there's essentially three places you can

873
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,260
go to work with a government agency

874
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,790
there's an offensive lender and there's

875
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,700
a defensive end of sorts you can also

876
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,829
well and the pros of working in

877
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,809
government agency is at least if you

878
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,130
you're okay with your particular

879
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,069
government you can be quite impactful

880
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:06,690
and you can have very direct insights in

881
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,520
the use of your work and in the benefits

882
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,490
that your work brings to society

883
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,750
the downside is that the pay is

884
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,730
comparatively low and that you are under

885
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,910
pretty onerous travel restrictions

886
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,900
particularly work from home is not a

887
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,410
thing that most Sigurd agencies do then

888
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,690
career advancement also usually means

889
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,760
moving away from a technical work in

890
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,210
these organizations and in what may also

891
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,619
happen is that the organization is an

892
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,630
odd source of all the technical work to

893
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,190
contractors and then you end up being

894
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,599
inside a government agency with the

895
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,430
travel restrictions and the bad pay and

896
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,799
you end up merging contractors instead

897
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,030
of doing the interesting work yourself

898
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,500
so that's something that may happen if

899
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,150
you work for an offensive vendor you get

900
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,710
much better salaries than on the

901
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,040
government side but the issue with many

902
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,049
offensive vendors is that for them their

903
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:56,970
profit is maximized when their restraint

904
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,069
on their sales is minimized subject to

905
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:00,650
all the government's threats which means

906
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,210
for many offensive vendors selling to

907
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,250
the scummiest customer you can get away

908
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:10,349
selling to maximize their profit so that

909
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:12,480
leads to people selling things to

910
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,930
governments that may invite people to

911
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,279
their embassies to kill and dismember

912
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,840
then another corner is that the insight

913
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,130
into the actual use of your work is

914
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,350
quite limited and you imagine may try to

915
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,060
actively deceive you if you look at the

916
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,860
hacking team history management was

917
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,869
actively trying to mislead the employees

918
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:33,570
into how like they're selling to and how

919
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,550
much facilities they're doing there's

920
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,910
also the con that legal protections may

921
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,770
be unclear in the long run like it's not

922
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,020
clear it's not set out in legal practice

923
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,119
whether you can be held responsible for

924
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,260
crimes committed with stuff you do and

925
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,420
so let's say you sell an odor to

926
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,040
government that then hacks and other

927
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,780
government it is not entirely clear

928
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,030
whether you're not an accessory to the

929
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,350
attack and whether other government

930
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,440
couldn't go after you along we've seen

931
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,960
this with the I inviting some people in

932
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,900
the Russian supply chain already we

933
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,619
shall see

934
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,390
pointers it's uncertain um there's the

935
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,150
choice of working for a defense offender

936
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,110
which usually comes with a pretty good

937
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,050
salary or with a slightly less good

938
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,760
salary but with fantastic job

939
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,230
flexibility when it comes to bug

940
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,410
bounties and the our piece another Pro

941
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,390
is there's fewer ethical miss incentives

942
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:31,440
for the most part the downside is you

943
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,930
are usually not business-critical it

944
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,930
sounds harsh to say but security is

945
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,609
something that is an afterthought for

946
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:41,490
business reasons and you're always a

947
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:46,680
cost center so yeah and lastly this is

948
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,119
something that individuals have to

949
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,359
imagine dividual a but not everybody

950
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,850
deals well with doing bug hunting in

951
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,490
order to squash bugs like I know quite a

952
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,869
few of owner ability researchers that

953
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,730
like hunting bugs and they like writing

954
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,430
the exploit but they don't enjoy seeing

955
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,500
the bug fixed and hence the export

956
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,170
killed so you also need to be able to

957
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,400
deal with that emotionally in that

958
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,119
career path then there's the thing that

959
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,950
the question is to what extent are you

960
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,109
actually adding value to society with

961
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:22,920
your work and I I'm not sure I'm not

962
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,710
always sure whether my work added like

963
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,150
how much my work added for you though

964
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,630
the situation society is really strange

965
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,360
is that device vendors have turned

966
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,250
themselves into defective spy agencies

967
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,250
for our targeting and you know further

968
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,380
bizarre twist of fate the population is

969
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,460
actually paying for their own

970
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,410
surveillance gear because people want to

971
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,760
have a nice phone so they're paying

972
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,230
people to give them a nice phone and

973
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,430
then the phone is used to surveil them

974
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,340
in some sense and the spy agencies these

975
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,290
days want a other piece of that pie in

976
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,380
terms of they want some of that data and

977
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,190
then they the question I ended up asking

978
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,430
myself sometimes is how does offensive

979
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,560
work improve society or improve

980
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,970
anybody's else's life except mine and

981
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,980
the the potential for having positive

982
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,280
impact on many millions of people is not

983
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,110
always but in many situations a little

984
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:15,800
bit limited

985
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,790
so yeah this is a diagram that that

986
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,100
establishes or illustrates the weirdness

987
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,900
of the modern situation right we've got

988
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,030
the device vendors they spent billions

989
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,000
to convince people that getting a new

990
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,370
device that surveys them is great and

991
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,720
the population dies and carries

992
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,550
surveillance gear voluntarily and

993
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,650
provides data to the vendors and on the

994
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,960
security folks either pull out the data

995
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,080
like the security apparatus folks either

996
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,850
pull that other data of our lawful data

997
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,100
requests all they pull all the data by

998
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,750
offensive means but it's a strange

999
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,510
it's a strange setup I stare at it and I

1000
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,410
can't really make sense of it another

1001
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,950
downside of offensive work is it gets

1002
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,650
emotionally complicated I love

1003
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,660
discovering bugs and I love writing

1004
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,320
exploits

1005
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,380
but that process is very pure in the

1006
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,030
sense that it's only technical there's

1007
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,040
no implication stuff but once you've got

1008
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,710
the bug and the exploit every decision

1009
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,840
you take that after can be turned into

1010
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,580
an entire bookshelf of moral philosophy

1011
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,400
PhD theses or gigabytes of Twitter

1012
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,940
debates nonsense and in some sense I

1013
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,920
don't enjoy these complications I just

1014
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,230
want to do my work and solve problems

1015
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,780
and that's it and I don't don't really

1016
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,610
enjoy the complications that come with

1017
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:35,230
doing the work so that's the downside

1018
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,260
and if you get to the reason number five

1019
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,180
is there's a joke that says it is

1020
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,770
difficult

1021
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,290
get a man to understand something when a

1022
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,480
salary depends upon his not

1023
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,030
understanding it so what what is meant

1024
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,270
by this is that people typically

1025
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,800
ideologies and their worldview by

1026
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,870
functionality to themselves meaning they

1027
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:58,540
will believe whatever makes like

1028
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,890
whatever listen to do what they want to

1029
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:04,180
do and my worry was that after many

1030
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,420
years in security being economically

1031
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,340
dependent on working security is

1032
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,050
actually distorting my views of the

1033
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,480
world and the view my views on society I

1034
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,120
was very curious about how would my

1035
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,220
worldview change if I wasn't dependent

1036
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,610
on security for income and if I could

1037
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,890
look at the world without security

1038
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,240
glasses on and so I decided that that's

1039
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,560
something I would like to try at some

1040
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,970
point and another emotional reason that

1041
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,360
is like speaks against offensive work is

1042
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,950
offensive work is very much non

1043
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,590
accumulated what I mean with this is if

1044
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,690
you work on something for ten years ten

1045
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,030
years down the line you have a result

1046
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,480
and your tooling is better and the

1047
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,490
trouble with offensive work is that you

1048
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,730
have these things that die and like you

1049
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,380
end up looking at ten years of a career

1050
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,910
and you can say well I have this buggy

1051
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,310
no mrs. H was a lot missus remote it was

1052
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,710
fantastic but it's dead I found this RDP

1053
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,720
remote and it's dead and I developed

1054
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,550
this technique for exposing this

1055
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,890
allocator and was to replace it with a

1056
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,300
new malachite and nobody use anymore so

1057
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,730
that's did so the strange thing about

1058
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,590
offensive work is that even by

1059
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,350
technology industry standards the work

1060
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,780
is particularly ephemeral a lot of stuff

1061
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,430
just disappears and Technica downside

1062
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,250
number seven offensive work when you

1063
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,800
maximize profits is actually a super

1064
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,020
repetitive what happens here is that a

1065
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,120
new target has a really high ramp up

1066
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,820
costs starting like trying to find your

1067
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,920
first remote code execution in chrome is

1068
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,410
much more expensive than finding the

1069
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,150
next ten because once you understand the

1070
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,290
code base is enough to find one you

1071
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,320
usually find a cluster of them and for

1072
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,440
the offensive market their tool trains

1073
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,570
depend on swap ability of parts meaning

1074
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,000
they just want to have capability

1075
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,470
against crow they want to advocate boots

1076
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,460
against far for someone to have

1077
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,350
capability against iPhone yada yada yada

1078
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,870
um what this means is that the market

1079
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,050
demand is always for the same thing and

1080
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,340
the learning effect for you as a

1081
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,140
researcher on your tenth Chrome or your

1082
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,760
tenth to Safari or your tenth iOS

1083
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,560
cuttlebug is much less than on your

1084
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,250
first so in a sad way if you maximize

1085
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,440
your profit when you do offensive work

1086
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,990
and bug selling you also maximize your

1087
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,190
boredom and stagnation and that's a not

1088
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,780
a great position to be in if you have to

1089
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,390
trade off earning more money against

1090
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,280
being bored in that in that sense I

1091
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,800
presently I love learning more than

1092
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,530
anything and I don't particularly enjoy

1093
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,920
repetition so that was a bit of a downer

1094
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,900
fun um another reason that I find

1095
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,820
difficult both offensive work is you end

1096
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,470
up becoming an expert of obsolete

1097
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,960
technology and what's happening there is

1098
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,420
that obsolete technologies is where all

1099
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,250
the bugs are there's more people that

1100
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,780
have deeply analyzed through type font

1101
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,390
rendering than like four bugs then then

1102
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:02,200
photography and the customers want mass

1103
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,630
mass market technology the technology is

1104
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,040
sitting fried everywhere but that's

1105
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,480
awful much all of them emerging

1106
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,030
technology and what happens is you pour

1107
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,650
all your your lifeblood into these

1108
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,110
obsolete technologies to understand them

1109
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,060
and at some point you're stuck with an

1110
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,590
encyclopedic knowledge of how TrueType

1111
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,120
font rendering bugs evolve from a

1112
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,010
artifact to valve but that doesn't mean

1113
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,200
that like true time is actually an

1114
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,670
interesting technology for the next 20

1115
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,480
years technical reason number 9

1116
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,450
why offensive work is not always great

1117
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:34,420
is there's a risk of missing a huge

1118
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,220
technology transformation at the moment

1119
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,110
because computing is changing more

1120
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,970
rapidly right now in the last five years

1121
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,060
than it has in the 20 years beforehand

1122
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,890
and data center space computing is

1123
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:46,660
emergent there's emergent approach

1124
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,780
operating systems nobody with any clue

1125
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,030
how to properly architect them no proper

1126
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,070
data center sized operating system

1127
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,070
exists no real debugging exists the end

1128
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:58,930
of Moore's Law is happening software is

1129
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,030
being reshaped already hardware's being

1130
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,490
reshaped deeply and a lot of offensive

1131
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:03,970
work

1132
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,220
hey another bug in Crowley's thanks or

1133
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,770
another Safari bug and iOS progress

1134
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,590
please things and it feels like that's

1135
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,180
playing on the sidelines of where the

1136
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,820
actual big changes in technology are

1137
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,450
happening anyhow and I'm getting to my

1138
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,580
end of the list of Darkness because I've

1139
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,020
been negative for the last ten slides

1140
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,780
here and for me that was the obituary

1141
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,480
test I only believe in reverse

1142
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,920
engineering you live backwards from the

1143
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,470
obituary you would like to have and I

1144
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,970
like reading obituaries they're my

1145
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:36,070
favorite piece of literature really and

1146
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,630
my wife always calls me captain sunshine

1147
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,230
for my funny dark and I love in life but

1148
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:44,290
the way I think a successful life can be

1149
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:46,750
led is by imagine in your head or write

1150
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,369
write the obituary that you would like

1151
00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:51,369
to read about yourself and then try to

1152
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:53,560
live your life to get the obituary you

1153
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,150
want and when I imagined my obituary it

1154
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,530
felt like I should do something else for

1155
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,840
a while one of my idols Corrado Rashad

1156
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,250
who taught me more about Heep

1157
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,420
exploitation than anybody else

1158
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,820
indirectly has a very successful

1159
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,650
post-security career building imaging

1160
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:11,920
satellites and I quite envy Envy him for

1161
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,420
that and many other of my idols have

1162
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,710
multiple careers where they did one

1163
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,900
thing successfully for 20 years and then

1164
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,490
they did something else also

1165
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:20,560
successfully for another 20 years so I

1166
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,720
had a bit of a fear of being a one-trick

1167
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,140
pony

1168
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,540
and I decided I should at least try

1169
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,220
something else for a while I can return

1170
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,000
to security if everything else fails so

1171
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,010
I made a decision at some point let's do

1172
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:33,790
something else for a while

1173
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,380
and I realized that performance

1174
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,760
optimization actually has a lot of

1175
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,130
technical upsides of offense meaning is

1176
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,720
similarly for stack you need to

1177
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,770
understand the Attar system to

1178
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,660
understand performance you have very

1179
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,400
similar technical alignment of

1180
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,310
incentives and when you do good

1181
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,450
technical work and you translate to

1182
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,490
monetary savings easily there's lots of

1183
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,050
interesting problems a lot of room for

1184
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,070
creative solutions and at least for me

1185
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,119
personally at the moment there's a few

1186
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:00,970
emotional advantages where I really

1187
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:04,210
enjoy not having am big biggest feelings

1188
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,710
about the implications of my work like

1189
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,140
for the moment I don't have to think

1190
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,210
about for whom for a moment and that's

1191
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:12,250
actually quite nice and if I'm

1192
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,920
successful I also save on on co2

1193
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,290
emissions so

1194
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,900
that's that's cool and motivating

1195
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,160
another great advantage of lots of doing

1196
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,780
security for a while is in Twitter

1197
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,820
debates because I can always claim

1198
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,410
everybody else that has an opinion on

1199
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,540
security on Twitter that their judgment

1200
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,220
is clouded by depending economically on

1201
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,720
it so I can try and I know the truth

1202
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,640
because I don't have this fight

1203
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,980
so that's at least a good way to win

1204
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,400
Twitter arguments we shall see whether I

1205
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,690
can actually make money on this because

1206
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,580
it's much harder to become a tax on GP

1207
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,690
doing efficiency work but in the

1208
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,690
meantime I'm enjoying what I'm doing so

1209
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:52,930
summary of this talk is offensive work

1210
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,840
is really really great and offensive

1211
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,000
work is really really really terrible at

1212
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,130
the same time that's some simultaneously

1213
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:03,190
true and there's all these great things

1214
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,350
and all these bad things and it's

1215
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,700
fascinating and another thing that I

1216
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,260
want to hammer home is one should be

1217
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,090
really mindful of the fragility of the

1218
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:15,370
democracies of personal rights because

1219
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,370
they can be gone very quickly and all

1220
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,810
the ethical questions in security are

1221
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,550
real and they're complicated and they

1222
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:25,630
have no easy answers lastly it's

1223
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,730
important to remember yourself security

1224
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,680
often feels like it can be the world but

1225
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,450
security is a small fragment of a much

1226
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,640
bigger world an offensive work is a

1227
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,200
small fragment of a much bigger

1228
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,450
computational growth so all of this is

1229
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,700
exciting and fascinating but there's a

1230
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,140
lot of stuff although that's also

1231
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,240
exciting and fascinating and my view is

1232
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,030
let's say I fail at this other stuff um

1233
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,460
I've certainly learned so much about

1234
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,960
distributed systems and large-scale

1235
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,790
computation infrastructure in the last

1236
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,260
on how the years of doing something else

1237
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,540
but when I return to security or that

1238
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,720
wouldn't be very helpful anyhow in

1239
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,020
anybody's career in security finding a

1240
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,610
balance between the upsides and

1241
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,890
downsides of offensive work is a

1242
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,650
challenge and a balancing act and I

1243
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,060
don't think I can help anybody

1244
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:14,320
individually with it I everybody good

1245
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:14,830
luck with it

1246
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:18,370
and yeah enjoy the calm it's gonna be

1247
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:24,790
great and that was that was amazing hey

1248
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:29,230
I I having worked in security for a long

1249
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,000
time feel like

1250
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,640
there's so many things there that I knew

1251
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,320
but didn't know how to articulate that

1252
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,510
you've just was very crisp and yeah and

1253
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,100
very very relevant to a lot of the

1254
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,420
debates we've seen today as we talk

1255
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,730
about offensive tooling over Twitter and

1256
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:47,310
I know someone in open source as well

1257
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,450
it's like me very challenged as that

1258
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,640
conversations on got going on and I've

1259
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,020
intentionally not released some stuff

1260
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,270
because of that this leaves me

1261
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,580
rethinking and repositioning and it just

1262
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,460
yeah

1263
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:02,390
that was fantastic but some graduate of

1264
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,530
I'll throw we've got we've got a

1265
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:07,620
question from discord just wondering

1266
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,270
there any thoughts on the fourth part in

1267
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,220
your second dislike with InfoSec

1268
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:14,310
specifically in-house practitioners not

1269
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:18,050
working government nor a security vendor

1270
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,490
so I mean you can work at a security

1271
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,610
sorry you can work defensively in-house

1272
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,950
securing things where at least the

1273
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,750
downside of being a cost center and not

1274
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,880
being business critical of trying all

1275
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,610
right I mean you you're there you're

1276
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,830
making a contribution but for most

1277
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:39,570
products you will always face the battle

1278
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,550
of having to argue the business impact

1279
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,910
of the security work and whenever push

1280
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,340
comes to shove security will have a

1281
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,050
difficult time arguing that they're

1282
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,760
critical in some sense it makes make

1283
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,290
some business sense for businesses to

1284
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,880
play fast and loose with the security

1285
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,470
because that's how you get market share

1286
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:02,760
at the moment it's a bit sad but yeah so

1287
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,900
the question at all yeah I feel so it's

1288
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,860
a I think so I think if that was

1289
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,120
something that you want to expand on

1290
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,440
they could they can message you on

1291
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,670
Twitter as well I think that's a great

1292
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,110
dialogue for this I think this is the

1293
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,430
kind of talk that's gonna have a lot of

1294
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:20,400
that like on flow dialogue for quite a

1295
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,230
while as we kind of digest and

1296
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:23,640
understand it deeper because there's so

1297
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,350
much there you just kind of like sit

1298
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,750
there like with all these thoughts that

1299
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,940
later on I'll come up and for a lot of

1300
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,540
these topics the trouble really is that

1301
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,820
you can have a long discussion about a

1302
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,530
good number of these now it's like

1303
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,110
there's like for example what precisely

1304
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,110
is the role of the in-house security

1305
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:46,760
and you can't do them justice with one

1306
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,920
side really so there's a lot of parts of

1307
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,510
the talk where you can spend an hour or

1308
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:55,340
two discussing it later but like you did

1309
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,070
all this information was so cool

1310
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:00,590
it's almost mind-blowing yeah and your

1311
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,140
expertise is so deep when it comes to an

1312
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,250
understanding on all this so I've got a

1313
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,980
couple of questions - there's two person

1314
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,630
that I got on my person who knows out of

1315
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,580
this but also one that I have that came

1316
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,110
from the shaft we're gonna do the

1317
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:20,500
shopman first and I think was a Hello

1318
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,000
something but Pony sorry so if I'm

1319
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,980
missing your handle but let's do this so

1320
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,930
the question is for the speaker if an

1321
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:29,210
organization won't fix it is it better

1322
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:33,230
for it for the for the security and put

1323
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,030
the research into think of public and

1324
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:37,730
what if the organization can't afford to

1325
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:40,100
fix the bug say it's a non-profit or a

1326
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,920
hospital that's 100% volunteer on who is

1327
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,080
responsible for the fallouts what are

1328
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,160
your thoughts on that

1329
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:52,940
so my warning up front is I will not be

1330
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,650
able to elaborate all the complexities

1331
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,810
of that topic in the next 10 minutes or

1332
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:00,770
even two hours the second note is I

1333
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,840
wrote a very very long blog post about

1334
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,520
my thoughts on disclosure titled

1335
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,020
disclosure Russian or Russian or not

1336
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,750
disclosure because there's there is no

1337
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,730
easy answer for this my personal view is

1338
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:13,700
that users of software have a right to

1339
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,230
know the properties of the software and

1340
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,480
that includes knowing about the security

1341
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,770
bugs so my personal view is that it is

1342
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:24,590
not like giving people the full

1343
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,960
information is still preferable to

1344
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,700
hiding it from them because that allows

1345
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,920
people that actually care about security

1346
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,340
to make informed decisions and I've you

1347
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,810
keeping security information secret over

1348
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,120
the long run as depriving users of the

1349
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,620
software of a right to know people can

1350
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,360
disagree on this but the reason why I

1351
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,100
worked at Project zero was because I

1352
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,170
think that telling people about

1353
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,270
everything that's broken is actually a

1354
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,810
net benefit to society so

1355
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,880
I hope that answered that question cool

1356
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,190
and I love that but now let's use get

1357
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:02,860
over to the more not so technical

1358
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,760
questions I really love the idea that um

1359
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,100
when you talked about how it feels like

1360
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,170
black magic right and in the beginning

1361
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:14,440
everything in InfoSec or security or

1362
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,150
anything that's new to you looks like

1363
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,740
black magic the first you see somebody

1364
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,120
playing around with a couple of cards

1365
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,850
like oh my god that's so cool somebody

1366
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,890
puffs a shell or something it slow your

1367
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:26,290
mind and the more you learn about it the

1368
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,050
cooler you're kind of getting it it's

1369
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:32,320
it's losing its shine a bit but I've got

1370
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,150
a question for you that's outside of

1371
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:37,240
that and if you go food like it feels

1372
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,400
like I don't know you personally I don't

1373
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,320
really know your work but it feels like

1374
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,940
you've been doing this for a very long

1375
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,730
time how do you go with periods when you

1376
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:48,430
can't find results or how do you deal

1377
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,500
with questions like burnouts and and

1378
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,330
that kind of stuff that we all struggle

1379
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,670
with and so this is super interesting

1380
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:58,050
right because when I was a young man I

1381
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,910
viewed a lot of these questions as soft

1382
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,140
questions are not very interesting

1383
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,530
questions and I sometimes like every few

1384
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,000
years I started with training scales for

1385
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,310
ability development and turns out that

1386
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:10,750
by now I've got almost a two-hour

1387
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,290
section on that at the end because

1388
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,610
managing your own motivation managing

1389
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,920
your own balance and managing your own

1390
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,820
physical and mental health for the

1391
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,410
process of vulnerability discovery and

1392
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,840
exploitation is actually really an

1393
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:28,720
important part of the game and so what

1394
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,680
what worked for me often was rotating

1395
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,540
between the actual bug hunting and

1396
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,020
improving tooling like I get frustrated

1397
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,190
doing manual labor but sometimes like

1398
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,660
sometimes got ability development feels

1399
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,220
like digging a trench for the spoon or

1400
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,380
digging a trench with chopsticks right

1401
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,820
and you really want to shovel or like

1402
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,140
ideally would want a bulldozer but you'd

1403
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,740
be happy with a shot so I I ended up

1404
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,440
doing sometimes was just cycling from

1405
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,650
the the chopstick digging to I'll try to

1406
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,570
build a shovel and to some extent a

1407
00:56:58,570 --> 00:56:59,920
building bendeth which was the first

1408
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,070
patch tipping mechanism was something

1409
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,960
like building a shovel and then could

1410
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,260
spend a couple of months there and

1411
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,210
can rotate back into the the probability

1412
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:11,090
research side and becoming a better dev

1413
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,160
actually improved me as a vulnerability

1414
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,590
research as well because in the end when

1415
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,760
a brutal researchers awful about

1416
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,140
understanding development processes

1417
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:19,930
understanding development best practices

1418
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,940
an example for this is a friend of mine

1419
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,560
is a great c-plus faster than I talk to

1420
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:29,300
him a lot and when the stat cookies

1421
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,080
happened in Windows boxes but when

1422
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,810
stackless cookies when your big critters

1423
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,880
like it's fat GS ended up being almost

1424
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,740
everywhere I found myself in weird

1425
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,910
situations where sometimes had a stack

1426
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,300
overflow and GS cookie was there but the

1427
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,859
thing was still exploitable because I

1428
00:57:45,859 --> 00:57:47,930
ended up overwriting an entire C++

1429
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,820
object on the stack and this happen to

1430
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,720
me more than once

1431
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,119
and I was like so once is coincidence

1432
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,160
but I've seen two or three overflows now

1433
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,480
which I could still exploit in spite of

1434
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,400
the presence of Jesus I couldn't make

1435
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,750
sense of it and then I spoke to this

1436
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:00,890
asleep response they're friends of mine

1437
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,900
and he's like well of course you would

1438
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,730
find extra full objects on the stack

1439
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,290
which you can override because the

1440
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,030
guidelines for modern C+ busses do

1441
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,070
everything scoped locally which means

1442
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,570
you'll have all these live objects

1443
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:13,010
including the vtable pointers on the

1444
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,060
stack

1445
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,890
that if you're writing like upwards on

1446
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,210
the stack past the TS and you override

1447
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:18,380
an object and something has passed a

1448
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,030
point into the current function you can

1449
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,900
still get get code execution so my coin

1450
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,170
theory is understanding more about how

1451
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,490
people write software will make you a

1452
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:29,810
better vulnerability to a person so

1453
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,480
cycling between those two helps then I

1454
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,070
learned a very hard lesson about

1455
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,130
managing my health because I had a

1456
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,270
conversation with a doctor in my late

1457
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:40,520
20s that said if you want to reach 36 or

1458
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,820
35 you need to make lifestyle changes

1459
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,560
where I had just overworked myself to a

1460
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,490
point with my immune system collapsed so

1461
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,950
what I'm saying is folks get up from

1462
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,840
your desk move do some exercise it

1463
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,880
sounds silly but if you want to be

1464
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:00,380
around long term that's important and

1465
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:03,080
then the other part is everybody goes

1466
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,650
through dry spells and fretting about

1467
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:08,750
the dry spell will not fix the dry spell

1468
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,400
like do something else for a while

1469
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,690
get your mind on something else learn

1470
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:14,000
more stuff that in the long run will be

1471
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,740
useful banging your head against the

1472
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,790
problem at that moment will not

1473
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:17,760
necessarily help

1474
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,110
like you'll need to do something else

1475
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:21,060
learn something I've related come back

1476
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,140
to the problem later on when your

1477
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,200
creativity is back and there's no shame

1478
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,360
in taking a break and there's also no

1479
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,860
shame in working on the same exploit for

1480
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:33,500
a year and a half that's all I see

1481
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,500
hey thank you so much however that was

1482
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,970
just you know watching the Chad I think

1483
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,760
there's a combination of people that you

1484
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,290
know some of the concepts you going

1485
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:46,170
through offense in career-wise when you

1486
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,180
it's given them a lot to chew on and

1487
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,650
then there's folks that have been around

1488
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,960
that that probably haven't ever heard

1489
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,690
the stuff that you just went through

1490
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,130
articulated as clearly and succinctly as

1491
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,020
that so we really appreciate it

1492
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,820
and yeah love it if you could hang

1493
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,440
around on the discord for a bit and chat

1494
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,910
to a few of us but thank you so much for

1495
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,100
being a part of level up sounds good

1496
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,060
thank you very much for having me

1497
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:20,110
