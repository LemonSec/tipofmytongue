love him so I'm gonna hand it off to

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:24,040

00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:30,369
up to it if everyone sees a big blank

33
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,470
black screen then I think we're good to

34
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,750
go yeah so everything yeah confront ah

35
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,640
dad

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,810
great so you know for all of us in the

37
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,510
beginning here there is nothing right no

38
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,080
skills no curiosity no existence there

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,659
is there is nothing that is what you are

40
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,100
seeing now but then from this nothing

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,259
there is something you make something

42
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,900
with maybe whatever's in front of you

43
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,590
maybe it's a spark of curiosity some

44
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,189
imagination some passion for something

45
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,010
it's maybe not great it's something and

46
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,930
maybe you it's your specialty

47
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,269
if you can make something from nothing

48
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,310
perhaps you can make something of

49
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,909
yourself

50
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:21,909
because you're a hacker right you like

51
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,730
doing hacker stuff you do hacker stuff

52
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,599
you learn glide you hack and suddenly

53
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,340
you don't have a computer you've got a

54
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,909
bunch of skills you can't stop all the

55
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:37,450
downloading but people suddenly want to

56
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,920

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,599

58
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,640

63
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:04,930
corporate industrial machine and you are

64
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,260
a tiny trivial irreplaceable cog in an

65
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,599
endless in different system that owes

66
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,989
you absolutely nothing great right you

67
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:15,519

69
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,699
course I know that we all have our own

70
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:24,310
unique starting points know a lot of you

71
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,099

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,060

we're trying to get to you and we

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,510
experience a unique path and to think

77
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,129
that everyone's path is the same it

78
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,629
definitely isn't even though we all call

79
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,989
ourselves the same thing hackers and

80
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,569
while we share many things in common we

81
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:48,579
have this unique journey right so for me

82
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,709
I went from playing video games and

83
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,019
cheating and video games on a farm in

84
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,359
the middle of nowhere to buying a

85
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,549
one-way ticket to Ukraine before I even

86
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:59,379
graduated high school and then coming

87
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,989
back and working in IT I got a computer

88
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,090
science degree somewhere along the way I

89
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,579
landed a job doing Incident Response on

90
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,180
the blue side not where I wanted to be

91
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,310
eventually I switched to red teaming at

92
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,609
that old Hawaiian cloud factory I became

93
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,060
a manager became director the red team I

94
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,670
got fired that was awesome

95
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,040
then I became director of a red team

96
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,260
again I went back for more of it because

97
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,360
I care about it because I'm passionate

98
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,560
about it and I got to build a team of

99
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,070
amazing people I got to do things that I

100
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,200
really wanted to do even beyond red

101
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,810
teaming I got to do all of this despite

102
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,060
being a tiny cog and an endless

103
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,180
indifferent machine which brings me here

104
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,800
to the now first slide of this

105
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,170
presentation business trade craft for

106
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,850
hackers in the corporate industrial

107
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,850
complex this is a this is a career slide

108
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,890
deck this is about how to navigate these

109
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,630
things in the business world if you want

110
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,330
to go into them because I don't know

111
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,310
what your experience is but I know one

112
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,930
trained me but any of these things I

113
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,010
needed to know and everyone just

114
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,180
expected me to know them so we're gonna

115
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,210
talk about a few things some subjects

116
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,190
like living off the land how to look

117
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,750
professional even if you really aren't

118
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,200
I'll teach you some tricks to influence

119
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,060
without Authority and what influence

120
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,920
about Authority actually means we'll

121
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,810
talk about empire building if you've

122
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,430
ever heard that we'll talk about

123
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,770
climbing the corporate ladder and I'm

124
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,270
gonna just share with you the things

125
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,950
that I found most effective in

126
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,750
navigating this big corporate space

127
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,600
while still trying to hold on to my soul

128
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,670
as a hacker even while becoming a

129
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,880
corporate sellout so the first topic

130
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,590
living off the land

131
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,900
right you know I would expect most

132
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,700
candidates interviewing for a Red Team

133
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,170
role and probably most of you kind of

134
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,630
heard this before it's this idea that

135
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,190
when we get inside an environment we're

136
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,010
not gonna drop like all our cool script

137
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,990
kiddie hacking tools onto a box we're

138
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,340
not gonna be dropping in mapping a bunch

139
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,290
of stuff because that's exactly what

140
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,420
we've trained systems overtime to detect

141
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,400
Achatz so if you want to go undetected

142
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,800
which you have to if you're in operating

143
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,180
against a live environment and you want

144
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,770
to stay in there you need to use the

145
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,270
tools that are already there you can't

146
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,180
drop new binaries and things so this

147
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,950
applies also to your career you get

148
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,900
dropped into a new system a new place

149
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,640
you want to use the tools that are

150
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,800
already there don't try and reinvent all

151
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,540
of them this is gonna sound like the

152
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,270
most boring advice ever but read the

153
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,220
employee handbook if you ever get a job

154
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,960
anywhere go and read the employee

155
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,120
handbook just like you read the manual

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,320
for a system

157
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,810
that maybe you've never been that you've

158
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,340
never seen before you never used before

159
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,380
you want to read the manual for the

160
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,360
system that you're a part corporation

161
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,490
because if you want to cheat at being

162
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,630
inside that corporation you're gonna

163
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,180
need to know how it works the other

164
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,040
thing you're gonna want to read the

165
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,320
expense report policy one of the most

166
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,450
boring and uninteresting documents out

167
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,730
there it shows you what you can get the

168
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,590
company and how to get the company to

169
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,390
pay for your [ __ ] you will want to do

170
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,350
that additionally if you want to look

171
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,180
good in the company you want to look

172
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,070
like you fit in maybe you you probably

173
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,510
don't right if you've gone from

174
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,040
offensive security hacking on the

175
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,360
outside of the perimeter maybe you're a

176
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,070
bug bounty researcher then you go to the

177
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,040
inside you probably don't fit in with

178
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,500
the regular corporate culture there

179
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,640
everyone around you is trying to build

180
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,410
things everyone around you is trying to

181
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,480
make stuff better launch projects and

182
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,270
all you want to do is find the brightest

183
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,950
burning dumpster fire or wherever it

184
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,690
might be people don't like that right so

185
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,190
you're gonna want to fit in as much as

186
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,870
you possibly can one way you can do that

187
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,910
is brand assets and complain templates

188
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,650
which brings me to my second tip here

189
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,320
you want to look professional even if

190
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,390
you really aren't I've been doing it for

191
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,860
10 years an organ great so it's more

192
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,540
than just wearing a blazer and a

193
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,130
collared shirt although that certainly

194
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,430
doesn't hurt but you want to make

195
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,800
yourself look good in the written and

196
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,690
visual things that you make and I think

197
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,030
you guys can agree I don't have an

198
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,590
ability to do a show of hands right now

199
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,540
but I think you can agree my slides look

200
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,150
pretty dope right now you might be

201
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,250
surprised to learn that this is actually

202
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,560
my corporate slide deck template and I'm

203
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,660
not using it exactly the way it's

204
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,820
supposed to be used but there's certain

205
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,040
things that you get and it allows you to

206
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,450
blend in with the corporate culture

207
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,910
because you're using template almost

208
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,180
every company will have a template you

209
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,330
should use this because it's an easy way

210
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,080
to make you look like you belong if for

211
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,460
some reason you're like I'm not in a

212
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,620
corporation right there are templates

213
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,719
out there and you can find them but my

214
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,340
corporate side that template kind of

215
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,599
looks like this it's basically an

216
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,429
instruction manual on how to fit it

217
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,160
I also made all these slides in 48 hours

218
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,840
a couple months ago so it actually makes

219
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,520
it things pretty quick so what you don't

220
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,209
want to do

221
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:52,730
just use the default like Google side

222
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,850
template the default PowerPoint template

223
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,379
it's kind of it's kind of lazy its

224
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,809
generic it makes you look generic I know

225
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,999
that it kind of feels weird to try and

226
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,189
invest yourself and like making things

227
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:05,720
look good because you're like alright

228
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,550
really technical I'm really smart and

229
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,829
you know my work should stand for itself

230
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:12,829
but the work is only as good as how you

231
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,689
present it right because you have to

232
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,119
convince other people that the work you

233
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:19,910
do is valuable and one of the packaging

234
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,800
is part of it here and you don't want

235
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,240
your packaging to kind of look like the

236
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,360
default Java show input dialog box you

237
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,999
want it to look good so if you can't

238
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:30,529
find it and you're an internal company

239
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,170
search your intranet right if you're

240
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,119
having struggling with that right you're

241
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:37,999
a hacker right come on so use those to

242
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:40,970
figure out who runs the brand figure out

243
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,519
who might have these things and if all

244
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,179
else fails do crime corpus perhaps

245
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:48,980
there's some side deck type some slide

246
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,269
decks out there that look really great

247
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,449
in your organization copy it if you copy

248
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:55,279
a slide deck template you inherit that

249
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,170
theme so even if there isn't a template

250
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,790
or a scene for you to use just steal

251
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,679
someone else's and make it your own

252
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,299
perhaps but don't start from scratch and

253
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:04,600
don't start from a vanilla ice cream

254
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,360
so speaking of things that work well

255
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,670
this slide you saw two slides ago is one

256
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,649
of my favorite slide layout templates

257
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,660
and I grabbed this from my um corporate

258
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,949
template most corporate templates will

259
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,240
have this but this is kind of a

260
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,240
universal way to present information far

261
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,429
superior to the headline with many

262
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,079
little bullets here but it's three icons

263
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,540
text underneath right so you get three

264
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,100
pictures that kind of represent things

265
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,369
you care about and then you put a bold

266
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,049
headline underneath it and a little bit

267
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,519
of text and this can allow you to

268
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,799
present information and easily

269
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,869
digestible form of threes it's also

270
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,730
possible to do this with five right

271
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,309
however that being said these types of

272
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,720
templates you don't wanna overuse them

273
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,670
right they might be a secret weapon to

274
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,319
get big points across but if you do this

275
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:51,350
for every single slide people catch on

276
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,779
to your tricks there it's good when it's

277
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,100
part of a template but it's easy to

278
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,740
create it's not I could probably give

279
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,689
you an entire hour long presentation on

280
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:01,910
how to use Google slides very very

281
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,290
fancily because

282
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,149
those are the skills you gain when you

283
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:07,699
become a scorer corporate sellout but I

284
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:10,250
won't bother you with that anymore and

285
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,139
right now you're probably saying wow I'm

286
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,380
learning and I'm having fun well I got

287
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,290
another one for you actually if you want

288
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,870
to use memes and funny pictures and

289
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,000
stuff in a in an official-looking slide

290
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,120
template this slide is a big steep side

291
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,829
what you do is you take a picture and

292
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:30,560
make it a hole size and you put one word

293
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,290
on it now if you're like yes I got this

294
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,060
from Google Images this is not a royalty

295
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,889
free stock photo if you really want to

296
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,509
play by the rules you can find free

297
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:39,949
stock photos that you're allowed to use

298
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,399
right and pixabay is one site for that

299
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,399
on the splash is another if you want

300
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,290
really high quality things to put on the

301
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,089
background of a slide to really make

302
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,290
your point so that you can have

303
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,190
something there while you're talking

304
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,069
about your your work so that the

305
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:57,290
attention is on you rather than on what

306
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,509
the slide is about so you might be

307
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,490
thinking there's no way I could find

308
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,310
interesting images in a royalty free

309
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,230
stock photo that would really capture

310
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,170
the essence of Who I am but I present

311
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,880
you this I think this kind of has it all

312
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,510
here this is a royalty free stock photo

313
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,329
I found I think it captures what what

314
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,100
many of us might be about pretty

315
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,350
accurately and if it doesn't that's good

316
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,699
you're probably living a very healthy

317
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:25,010
lifestyle I know you're saying like

318
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,589
alright alright alright but how do I get

319
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:29,980
those little icons those little pictures

320
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,449
well for that if you haven't heard of it

321
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,040
there's this great website called the

322
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,589
noun project and most of the time if you

323
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,420
hire consultants externally to make your

324
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,680
slides good what they're doing is

325
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,389
they're going to this site they're

326
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,220
searching for icons and they're making

327
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,949
they're putting them next to words this

328
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:48,199
site kind of has everything it's about

329
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:50,510
thirty dollars or so a year for

330
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,550
subscription and you can get all of the

331
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,980
images for free however we're all

332
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,019
hackers I'm sure we could find to be

333
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,420
very easy way to take these images for

334
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,410
free if we so wanted to so you know act

335
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:10,399
accordingly Wow right this is also I'm

336
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,630
not really sure the difference between

337
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,199
Owen Wilson and Matthew McConaughey so

338
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:16,209
don't

339
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:19,039
also to illustrate the power of

340
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,039
non-project this side was made

341
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,809
completely using icons from now on

342
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:26,359
project on a blank black screen as part

343
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:29,509
of my corporate site so I'm hope with

344
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,359
these secrets you now are all feeling

345
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,979
that you don't have to just do this you

346
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,049
don't have to limit yourself to title

347
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,239
and bullet points it's boring because

348
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,470
right now most of you are probably

349
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,209
reading the slide instead of listening

350
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:42,249
to me

351
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:46,789
so alright let's talk about how to

352
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:48,499
influence without authority but first

353
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:51,859
maybe what this actually is in the

354
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:53,839
corporate world and actually probably

355
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,959
this applies to a lot of our bug bounty

356
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,269
researchers out there where you want

357
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,299
someone to to think something to do

358
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,329
something to agree with you right one of

359
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:07,669
the ways that doesn't work well is just

360
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:09,919
trying to argue at them right we are all

361
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,669
biased in our innate versions of reality

362
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:15,229
constructed by what we see what we've

363
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,349
experienced what we know to be true if

364
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:20,179
we try and impose our version of reality

365
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:22,729
on someone else and try to convince them

366
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,100
to think different but to convince them

367
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,359
that reality is different it is not

368
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,509
gonna work well so influencing without

369
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,369
authority comes comes into play in the

370
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:34,429
corporate world a lot because you often

371
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:36,109
like you're not the boss of everyone

372
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,970
even if you're CEO you're not gonna be

373
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,039
the boss so you're gonna need other

374
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,709
people to kind of agree with you

375
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,109
sometimes they're gonna be more senior

376
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:46,459
than you sometimes they might be your

377
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:49,789
peers and one of the easiest ways to do

378
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,669
this is to write things down for some

379
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:54,739
reason when when we talk to people face

380
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:56,569
to face especially when it's um when

381
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:57,919
it's up here or a boss or something

382
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,470
trying to convince them with just our

383
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,929
words for some reason very difficult if

384
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:07,309
you want to write out kind of either a

385
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,859
proposal for something a problem

386
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,329
statement we'll talk about that in a

387
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:13,999
little bit but but documenting things is

388
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:16,489
very it's very useful so one of the ways

389
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:19,159
I've been able to create a red team or

390
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,589
create kind of hybrid weird job roles or

391
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,600
functions wherever I've gone is by

392
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,779
writing out team charters and just but

393
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:28,940
merely by giving it a title

394
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,130
when a person's going to do in the

395
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,530
future somehow that then allows me to

396
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,420
create that job even if that job doesn't

397
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,280
exist even if it's not a normal thing

398
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,560
writing it out kind of makes it official

399
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,970
other people read it because they're

400
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,770
receiving it in a written format it

401
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,240
feels more official rather than just me

402
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,360
explain so let's talk about making a

403
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,790
proposal because at some point you're

404
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,900
gonna want to you're gonna want to

405
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,710
propose something and you want this to

406
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,480
be impactful you don't want this to be

407
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,420
an argument so one of the psychology

408
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,780
tricks I really like to use here is

409
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,240
giving people three options now in order

410
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,940
to get someone to pick the option I want

411
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,400
right there is a there is a trick that

412
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,000
for some reason when we have two options

413
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,850
that are similar but one of them is

414
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,330
slightly not as good it then makes that

415
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,800
option that is better seem better than

416
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,660
the option that is not so good but also

417
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,960
seem better than other options presented

418
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,400
having that ability to compare two

419
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,630
options so if I percent use three

420
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,970
options I'm gonna give you option one so

421
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,170
solution right

422
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,540
it's probably an OK solution but it's

423
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,550
not what I really want you to pick I'm

424
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,440
gonna give you option two that's gonna

425
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,020
be a solution that I think is really the

426
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,190
one I want you to pick and then I'm

427
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,480
gonna give you option three which is a

428
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,580
version of option two very very similar

429
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,650
but for some reason just slightly works

430
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,100
in some way and the presence of option 3

431
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,430
is going to make you favor option two

432
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,620
over option one and of course you're not

433
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,200
gonna pick the very shitty one most

434
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,260
people do that so this is a trick when

435
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,880
presenting three options to get people

436
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,500
to pick the one

437
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,929
like wow right so let's talk about some

438
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:16,119
other ways to influence people showing

439
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,799
data something we say very very

440
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,309
frequently everyone everyone thinks

441
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:24,388
they're great at showing data myself

442
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:27,130
included as a victim of the

443
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,779
dunning-kruger effect where I'm like I

444
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:31,000
made a chart in Excel like I'm awesome

445
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,570
at this I've learned a few things over

446
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,039
the years about showing data one is

447
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,960
there's different types of metrics and

448
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,539
data and you want to be really careful

449
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:43,120
and what you're trying to achieve if you

450
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,210
want people to think that you are great

451
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,980
then you're showing kind of performance

452
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,110
metrics on yourself right that those

453
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,809
things like how many bugs you found how

454
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,340
many how many of this thing you wanted

455
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,990
to change and a good way to do that is

456
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,669
showing it over time changes over time

457
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:59,740
because then people can see that before

458
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,929
you started your effort the state it was

459
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:03,279
something and then after you started

460
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,779
your effort it was something else right

461
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:07,840
and that metric is it's a it's a good

462
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,880
useful data point if you want people to

463
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,830
think that you're good but people

464
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,360
thinking that you are good at something

465
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,149
doesn't actually accomplish much so when

466
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:18,580
I want to change people's behavior just

467
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,799
showing them the impact that I made it's

468
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,750
it's nice it's good for me it helps them

469
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,610
trust me but it doesn't make them want

470
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,120
to do something different so by adding

471
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,789
passive comparison and competition to

472
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,799
things this is how you can if you have a

473
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,470
group of people and you want them to

474
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,200
compete the easiest way to do that is to

475
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,909
show them how they rank against each

476
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,950
other you don't have to rank them you

477
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,750
don't have to say number one number two

478
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,700
it doesn't have to be a competition but

479
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,080
if you show them data about their

480
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,610
performance and how they rank against

481
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,260
each other this probably happens to a

482
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,630
lot of you about any world you want

483
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,039
people to compete you show them how they

484
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,500
compare to each other right and I do

485
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,940
this when I want to get things like

486
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,039
internal initiatives adopted but you can

487
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,480
probably use this in lots of different

488
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,429
places like for instance I want people

489
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:04,870
to use a password manager inside our

490
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,559
corporation this isn't real data but I

491
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,179
show all of the leaders across the

492
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:12,429
organization I show them how how much

493
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:14,799
they have as a percentage of their group

494
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,360
and how they compare to their other

495
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,269
folks also you want to use something

496
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,389
called social proof

497
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:28,609
and this idea centers around having the

498
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:31,159
feeling that other people are doing the

499
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,299
thing that you want so if I want people

500
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,399
to use a password manager I should

501
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:39,739
should show people that other people are

502
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:41,329
using the password manager which can be

503
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:42,739
a little counterintuitive when I'm also

504
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:44,299
showing people that they're not so I

505
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,429
want to find some way to call out people

506
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:49,039
who are doing the right thing to give

507
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,190
them recognition so that peers see this

508
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,259
is achievable this is possible and they

509
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,969
also know kind of deep down in their

510
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:58,159
hearts and souls that people are doing

511
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:59,989
this and I'm not gonna be weird if I do

512
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:07,399
it too so all over the place here going

513
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:11,599
to talk about empire building now this

514
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,219
would normally be the point at which I'm

515
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:15,379
like it was heard this word before but

516
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:18,440
we don't have that luxury today so I'm

517
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,269
just gonna assume that maybe some of you

518
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:22,489
have heard this I'm also going to assume

519
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,309
that probably it's never really used in

520
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:30,440
a you know in a positive context when

521
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,109
people say oh they're an empire builder

522
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,450
it's it's kind of a bad thing normally

523
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,639
in the corporate world and what it means

524
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:40,359
if you're not familiar with it is that

525
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,999
peoples like an employee or a manager or

526
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:46,129
a leader in an organization their sole

527
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,619
kind of metric that they measure

528
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:51,259
themselves by their values it's all

529
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:54,709
around making the size of the people or

530
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,599
the organization or the budget or the

531
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,299
thing they control bigger it's all about

532
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,759
size how many direct reports do I have

533
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,549
how many people in my fork right and the

534
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:07,429
reason this is a bad thing is because if

535
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:10,639
you only measure yourself by the size of

536
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:12,289
things and not by the outcomes you

537
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:15,409
achieve you are often doing a large

538
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,419
disservice to a large number of people

539
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:19,399
within your organization your product

540
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:20,929
doesn't matter if you actually deliver

541
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,379
anything that's not good so maybe this

542
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:25,940
applies to us in lots of different ways

543
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,879
but it's not it's not about the size the

544
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:32,089
number those things can help but really

545
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:34,309
what we should focus on is outcomes what

546
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:36,139
is the impact we make in the world

547
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:36,380
what

548
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,540
the impact our team can achieve what is

549
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,450
the impact our group can cheat so I

550
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,300
wanted to talk to you about ok ours this

551
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,100
is the most boring kind of topic that

552
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,010
might be out there right and and if you

553
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,690
haven't been in the corporate Silicon

554
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,240
Valley space maybe you've never even

555
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,130
heard of this and it's ok but ok are it

556
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,350
stands for objective and key result its

557
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,950
way of making metrics it's very popular

558
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,080
the point here isn't about okay ours and

559
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,920
I'm not gonna try and explain them or or

560
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,030
say why they're good or why they're bad

561
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,960
or anything like that that's not

562
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,790
important what I wanted to tell you

563
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,940
about is a small story I had no clue

564
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,510
what it ok arts and I heard it you know

565
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,130
in my in my career at different times

566
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,420
really okay ours and I was just like

567
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,880
objective here result cool like I know

568
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,370
what that is that seems obvious so and I

569
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,410
started using it and say my arm do side

570
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,270
of my okay are to do in my okay are and

571
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,790
that's what ninety percent of people in

572
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,570
corporate space do it I switch jobs and

573
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,780
I saw like people really wearing though

574
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,820
into okay ours again and I thought you

575
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,280
know what I shouldn't just assume that I

576
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,140
know what this means and I'm seeing

577
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,550
everyone else doing this I'm gonna go

578
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,490
actually read the [ __ ] manual there's

579
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,030
a book on okay so in this case I went to

580
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,400
a to like a manager's meeting and they

581
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,720
were talking about it a few hours and

582
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,570
everyone was arguing about what what

583
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,370
they are what makes them good what makes

584
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,240
bad and I thought [ __ ] I really don't I

585
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,310
really don't know what makes it good or

586
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,170
what makes it that so I went and I got

587
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,140
the book and I read the book and since

588
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,450
doing that I found out that no one knows

589
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,160
what they're actually talking about

590
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,020
because no one does this there's like

591
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,180
three people and an organization of 200

592
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,560
that actually went to read the book but

593
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,380
everyone pretends like they so it is

594
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,350
going to make you feel a lot easier if

595
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,180
you're able to identify these things you

596
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,370
don't know and you just go read a book

597
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,250
watch a tutorial watch a video people

598
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,930
are right and I think I probably don't

599
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,400
need to say that to most of you because

600
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,410
you're a group of people who who are

601
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,540
always learning but just you know it

602
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,210
never get

603
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,610
never get complacent in where you are

604
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,899
and never think that because you've

605
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,370
achieved something that you're done

606
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,070
learning and never think that certain

607
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,380
topics are too boring to learn because

608
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,929
it's those boring things when combined

609
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:04,750
with the very cool technical powerful

610
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,270
things that end up making us kind of

611
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:12,789
capable of more so this is probably

612
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,100
interesting the most bug bounty folks

613
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,559
because you have no idea how this works

614
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,029
on the inside maybe and but it but it's

615
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,130
relevant to all of you because without a

616
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,080
budget of bug bounty program doesn't

617
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,120
really go anywhere right without a

618
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,309
budgeted security program doesn't really

619
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:32,740
go anywhere and there's some interesting

620
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,510
things about budgets and I think most

621
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,279
people think that you kind of snap your

622
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,559
fingers and then poof there's more I

623
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,809
mean most companies though budgets come

624
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:42,880
on a cycle right there normally tied to

625
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,640
two quarters sometimes it's the fiscal

626
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,090
year sometimes it's some other shifted

627
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,730
date for God knows why but but they're

628
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,529
coming cycles right and if you know what

629
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:56,590
this cycle is you can time your asks to

630
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,600
be a bit better when I was first

631
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,120
starting out you know and we were we

632
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,620
were building red team for the first

633
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,620
time there wasn't a big budget to go

634
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,620
bill red team so we had this idea that

635
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,169
we always kept in mind because what will

636
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:13,590
happen is at the beginning of a quarter

637
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,020
people would say they're gonna spend all

638
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,940
this money ask for all this budget the

639
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,470
budget would get allocated to all the

640
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,230
normal regular things then as the as the

641
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,659
quarter goes on people kind of like

642
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:27,549
always overestimate and they suck at

643
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:29,710
executing on things sometimes so what

644
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,210
ends up happening is you get towards the

645
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,850
end of the quarter and there's a bunch

646
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,490
of money left over so the idea of a

647
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,610
shovel-ready project is you have a

648
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,039
project your proposal everything all

649
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,020
written up so that when someone else

650
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,419
fails you can swoop in and take their

651
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,020
budget this is this idea this is how red

652
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,630
team's not built this is how or like big

653
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,090
security engagement teams get built this

654
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,789
is how I end up with a team of 12 red

655
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,789
teamers and not just one or two people

656
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:02,160
it's by having this ready

657
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,960
so that when other people fail we can

658
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,850
swoop in to say like you we need to

659
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,680
spend the budget right I got something

660
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,700
for you we're gonna start a

661
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,050
vulnerability research team we're gonna

662
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,910
start a behavioral engineering team

663
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,980
we're gonna hire someone to do branding

664
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,600
for our security team we're gonna throw

665
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,390
a party in Vegas well the party in Vegas

666
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,570
is on the shovel-ready project

667
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,160
so you're saying okay yeah all right

668
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:29,930
this is a Pope little Lil Jon oh so

669
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,750
climbing the corporate ladder is kind of

670
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,300
a [ __ ] thing right and it's something

671
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,260
that we often think that if we just show

672
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,780
up and we work and we do our job that

673
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,100
will result in some form of success and

674
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,110
it actually doesn't work like that right

675
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,470
like being in a corporation is a skill

676
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,570
being a manager is a skill and all these

677
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,600
are separate skills from the technical

678
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,630
hacking stuff that we do like post

679
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,590
exploitation and it is is something that

680
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,360
I like like I'm really passionate about

681
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,520
and I learned a lot about this I'm like

682
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,560
damn like if I land on your Mac like the

683
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,330
keys that I being dumb or mom like I've

684
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,160
got this stuff but then I became a

685
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,080
manager and I was like cool now I can

686
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,720
lead other people just because I'm good

687
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,220
at this thing so it doesn't work like

688
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,020
that you don't stay the best at anything

689
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,870
for very long and if you want to be able

690
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,520
to lead others you want to build teams

691
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,290
you want to build companies whatever it

692
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,430
is that you want to do you should go

693
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,950
seek that knowledge if you want to learn

694
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,150
how to climb the corporate ladder like

695
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,890
what you should be doing I found this

696
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,610
book useful the managers past it just

697
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,320
tells you about what what you should be

698
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,120
doing at each level of an organization

699
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,900
and speaking of levels if you actually

700
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,580
want to if you're in a career cellar

701
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,320
anywhere and you're you're in a

702
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,410
corporate structure your company

703
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,210
probably has something called a leveling

704
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,910
guide this is the greatest hack in

705
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,820
getting a promotion right just doing

706
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,820
your job like it it's never get like

707
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,860
maybe every once in a while someone's

708
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,510
gonna drop off this gift but like that

709
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,090
is not how you move forward the leveling

710
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,100
guide is normally a set of criteria

711
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,840
written fairly vaguely

712
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,690
inside an organization that says what is

713
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,240
expect

714
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,480
at each level and so you should figure

715
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,820
out where you are on this level guide

716
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,160
and you should read what the next level

717
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,440
up says that you're supposed to be doing

718
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,480
and then you should start to map back

719
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,880
all of the things you do to that right

720
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,560
read it all the time say like am i doing

721
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,230
this new thing is my scope like this is

722
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,580
subscribe you should use this in your

723
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,560
conversations with your manager right

724
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,540
you can't just go and ask for a

725
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,640
promotion cuz you've done good without

726
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,290
informing yourself like what the next

727
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,990
level is because like most companies

728
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,940
want someone who is going to perform

729
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,310
really well and stay exactly in the role

730
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,020
that they are right that's perfect

731
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,440
perfect

732
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360
no you're doing really great at this

733
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,560
thing why would we give you more

734
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,330
responsibilities so if you ever want

735
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,010
more responsibilities you want to go up

736
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,660
a level in your job or in your career

737
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,830
find the leveling guide figure out where

738
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,270
it says you are figure out where it says

739
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,080
you need to be another thing I guess to

740
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,390
note if you're if you're curious well I

741
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,710
guess I have you as a captive audience

742
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,730
so it doesn't really matter if you're

743
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,900
curious another thing Promotions like

744
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,930
budget they come in cycles it is

745
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,870
something that is limited right I think

746
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,580
most people don't realize but in large

747
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,170
corporations what happens and the way

748
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,200
promotions work is folks get in like a

749
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,840
room altogether and they have a big list

750
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,730
of people and there's a certain amount

751
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,040
of budget and then they try and rank all

752
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,230
the people a big long list order and

753
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,180
then at some point you know there's peer

754
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,770
reviews that go into it and is refused

755
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,090
but at the end of the day ends up being

756
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,620
a ranking and there's a line drawn

757
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,300
somewhere people above the line to

758
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,160
promote it well there's not enough

759
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,220
budget to do it so thank you so if you

760
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,200
want to be above the line just doing

761
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,620
your job so politics a dirty word most

762
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,129
of the time

763
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,720
politics and security you're very

764
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,910
interesting to say the least because we

765
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,070
are operating in an environment where

766
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,160
our industry is driven by our opinion

767
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,560
our opinion on how to achieve something

768
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,620
that is very unachievable right there is

769
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,460
no secure there is no insecure these are

770
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,680
these are opinions these are opinions

771
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,800
about how we feel and how the things we

772
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,770
have done measure up to what we expect

773
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,160
might happen now politics get nasty here

774
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,350
because when there is not really an

775
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,420
objective way to have security or not

776
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,810
have security in those in most cases a

777
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,330
lot of times it becomes about convincing

778
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,940
people things convincing people that a

779
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,360
certain activity is valuable so one of

780
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,190
the things I learned very early on is

781
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,950
this idea of political capital you

782
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,560
should think of your political capital I

783
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,630
got like a pile of money bank vault

784
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,150
certain amount of stuff and this applies

785
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,320
in life in the world in bug bounty in

786
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,370
corporate environments you have

787
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,200
political capital whenever you do

788
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,300
something that other people don't agree

789
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,030
with don't like or it takes their time

790
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,190
or it takes their energy you're spending

791
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,800
that political capital so whenever you

792
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,410
decide like you know I'm not okay with

793
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,600
the state of the world I'm going to I'm

794
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,340
going to try and force it to be

795
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,990
something else you know I'm not okay

796
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,620
with the status of my buck like it got

797
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,510
rejected or it's I think it should be a

798
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,580
higher criticality you are spending

799
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,920
political capital whatever you argue for

800
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,600
it to be something different you're

801
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,580
spending political capital whatever you

802
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,040
know you argue for a new job to be

803
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,390
created you're spending political

804
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,030
capital whenever you argue for people to

805
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,880
stop you know using their passwords and

806
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,470
putting their passwords in a shared

807
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,990
document or something like that

808
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,760
all of these things spend it whenever

809
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,580
you help someone achieve one of their

810
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,710
goals you're earning political capital

811
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,510
you've made an ally you've made a friend

812
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,610
someone owes you a favor someone sees

813
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,190
that you've helped their cause and that

814
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,190
kind of increases your what you don't

815
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,560
want to happen is for your account to go

816
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,230
to zero or to go to negative that's how

817
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,570
you get fired

818
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,929
what happens is that there you will may

819
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:25,759
have so many enemies people will find

820
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,649
that your contribution to the group

821
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:32,840
cause is no longer valuable relative to

822
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,880
the cost that you exert on everyone else

823
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,860
and a group or a community will

824
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,830
excommunicate you and that's not bad for

825
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,039
that is bad all right

826
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,710
this has been my rants about careers and

827
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,130
things and crap like that number of

828
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,690
books here on the screen that have

829
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,690
helped me along the way I think for

830
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,639
security folks black box thinking should

831
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:59,139
be a must read it's about how failure

832
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:01,340
how to think differently about failure

833
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,799
and how failure and drive us forward I'd

834
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,379
highly recommend it for anyone who is in

835
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:08,809
a constant state of trying things and

836
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:12,279
failing and trying them again it's a

837
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:16,250
morale boost so with that I'll let you

838
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,799
decide who is oh and Wilson and who is

839
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,169
Matthew McConaughey wow that that was

840
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:24,980
mind-blowing

841
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,029
you're so much insight here that you

842
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:32,320
collected this over quite a while right

843
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,629
I'm not a decade yeah

844
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:38,539
that's it's so amazing i screenshot to

845
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:40,220
the last page there because i realized

846
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,289
that all these books just needs to go

847
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:44,629
into my collection and super super

848
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:50,480
inspirational i've got the most asked

849
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,129
question in the chat that was coming

850
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:55,250
through he said how can you look so cool

851
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,929
like how do you become the level of

852
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:59,149
coolness that you you carry is that is

853
00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:01,879
that a shusun thing like you wake up any

854
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:03,470
morning say your swatch is cool as [ __ ]

855
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,990
today i'm gonna put on this or or or or

856
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,349
is it something that comes natural it's

857
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:11,989
interesting to hear the the master of

858
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:14,329
cool asking me about being cool right i

859
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:16,280
mean well first of all we have to wear

860
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,168
some tinted shades and doors right

861
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:19,579
because those are cruise control for

862
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:22,460
cool or they not that do my regular

863
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,710
glasses they're just transitions so um

864
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,460
and it's bright outside in today's yeah

865
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,130
but it's good it looks good looks good

866
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,260
I think so I think you know the truth

867
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,880
which I know yourself to be yourself

868
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,120
right um someone very early on and my

869
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,949
career gave me a piece of advice in

870
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,929
navigating at least like the Bay Area

871
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:48,139
job team it was don't try and be what

872
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,820
people want you to be you will then

873
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,949
become generic and just like everyone

874
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:52,340
else

875
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,590
find something you care about try and

876
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,970
get very good at it and don't give them

877
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,370
[ __ ] about anything else

878
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,170
that's a closer do you mind stop sharing

879
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,850
your slides today so we can see you

880
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,700
because the the the stream hasn't been

881
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,790
able to use fall in love with that smile

882
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,970
so there is the one and only Josh so I

883
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,450
got another question for you and and and

884
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,010
I kind of know the answer for this too

885
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,290
but it's a cool thing that is a question

886
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,600
that I at least need to ask when it

887
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,340
comes to you know a lot of things that

888
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,560
you talked about it's about social how

889
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,210
to behave in the social environment by

890
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,250
using that with a hacker's mentality a

891
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,050
little bit of social engineering and how

892
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,430
to fit in and understand how the

893
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,830
corporate world works but if you're an

894
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,840
introvert let's say that you're you're

895
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,310
not comfortable being around people

896
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,570
maybe you have a little bit of social

897
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,440
anxiety what would be your ideal tips

898
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,150
let's say someone on your team needed

899
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,460
that kind of like they do in a talk they

900
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,380
were feeling uncertain what would be

901
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,910
your your your give away for that right

902
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,610
it feels kind of disingenuous for me to

903
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:03,320
give introverts tips but you know I

904
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,990
think I think it comes down to

905
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,790
presentation right if we think of

906
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,740
introversion and extraversion sort of

907
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,660
like how our batteries get charged based

908
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,460
on interaction right it's like I'm

909
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,960
interacting with other people right now

910
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,910
after this I'm gonna have a lot more

911
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,450
energy for an introvert you interact

912
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,950
with a bunch of people afterwards you've

913
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,500
got a lot less energy so I think it

914
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,030
comes down to to managing those

915
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:29,030
interactions and one of one of the ways

916
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,860
I think it applies equally to both like

917
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,300
extrovert introvert but like the

918
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,160
preparation that goes in to an

919
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,960
interaction right so that you can

920
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,490
present to yourself in a confident way

921
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,750
so that you know what you're going to

922
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,660
say right that way and and then to limit

923
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,980
to the amount of interaction that you

924
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,430
get

925
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,910
because presenting in a meeting you know

926
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,859
we all get nervous extroverted

927
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:50,839
introverted we all get shy the thing

928
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:53,089
that the cure for that nervousness is is

929
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:56,119
preparation right you take time if it's

930
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,609
something that's new for us trying to

931
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:00,710
get like we all have our kind of close

932
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,619
group of trusted people right let's take

933
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:05,029
the things that we create and kind of

934
00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:06,740
run it by them and get feedback so that

935
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,450
we're not putting ourselves out there

936
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,089
for the first time when it really

937
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:12,740
matters or when we think like when we're

938
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,480
really nervous all right so that we can

939
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,220
so that we can feel confident so that we

940
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,150
can feel prepared that and yeah taking

941
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,660
time to be by ourselves actually yeah

942
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,759
actually that that's the thing if even I

943
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:27,619
is super extrovert you just need that

944
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:29,569
after conference I need to go to the

945
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:31,039
hotel room you just relax a bit because

946
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,180
it's draining

947
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,819
whatever you do so that's a that's an

948
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,039
interesting thing so lastly no I and

949
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,289
this is a question that doesn't really

950
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:41,240
have to do with the talk but you talked

951
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,369
about the shovel-ready project those

952
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:44,930
laser guns at Def Con

953
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,319
were they were they all prepared for for

954
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:50,749
the for their party like were those in

955
00:37:50,749 --> 00:37:53,180
you're ready to slide him it's time to

956
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,329
have it may have I mean in the whole the

957
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:58,160
whole party was a shovel-ready project

958
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,880
right so I mean the truth behind that is

959
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,089
we we wanted to create an event that

960
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:06,890
made us proud to be where we've worked

961
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,339
and the hope was that other people would

962
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:12,940
be interested to come work with us so I

963
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,579
I went and got the budget for my team

964
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:18,650
and and they executed on all the great

965
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,269
stuff that was there so I wish I could

966
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,710
take credit for all the fun things but

967
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,089
it's it's not just me it's a group of a

968
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:28,819
group of amazing created people trying

969
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:30,319
to trying to get out there in the world

970
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:33,950
and showcase themselves just just like

971
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,130
we're all doing here right so listen I

972
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,749
said there's this one that's come in

973
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,579
from the chat it's it's a bit

974
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:41,749
tongue-in-cheek but I think it's

975
00:38:41,749 --> 00:38:43,519
actually kind of clever as well it's

976
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,690
like do you think you can social

977
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,069
engineer your peers now that they've

978
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:51,619
watched this talk which is like but this

979
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:55,190
is how I social engineer my peers okay

980
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,000
so it's a judo move

981
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,920
no I mean the thing that I thought

982
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,690
interesting about that is like these

983
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,640
sort of these sort of techniques and

984
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,200
this idea of navigating how much do you

985
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,780
sort of see or how much have you felt

986
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,920
because clearly you're comfortable

987
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,120
sharing it now but how much have you

988
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,700
maybe felt in the past that's like your

989
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,250
special source that you need to just use

990
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,350
and potentially keep to yourself or you

991
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,440
know that'll kind of thing oh no I mean

992
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,060
I've always I've always found the most

993
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,660
value in in sharing things and it sounds

994
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,430
like those you know like a like a canned

995
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,770
response it's great to share but but but

996
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,900
really when you don't share stuff the

997
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,840
world becomes very annoying because you

998
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,030
know things and you feel things to be

999
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,230
true

1000
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,480
if you don't share it you have no way to

1001
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,910
test that right you just continue on

1002
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,650
with your version of reality thinking

1003
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,420
everything you think is right is true so

1004
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,680
you don't get any feedback you don't

1005
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,940
learn you don't grow if you don't share

1006
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,740
yourself but it's also very annoying

1007
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,780
that that you you feel like you need to

1008
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,490
step in to do these things and you're

1009
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,740
the only one like I don't I don't want

1010
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,780
to be the only one right I want I want

1011
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,420
you know companions in this in this

1012
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,340
world so I'm gonna share my stuff so I

1013
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,920
can get feedback the selfish reason and

1014
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,390
then the second selfish reason is like

1015
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,190
the more people who kind of know this

1016
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,500
the like if more people make better

1017
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,330
slides and use the same tricks than I

1018
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,070
will get to watch more slides that I

1019
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:26,290
like so it's I never find them as

1020
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,970
someone who presents a bit and thought I

1021
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,370
had a good slide deck I feel like you

1022
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,840
would watch a lot of talks and be like I

1023
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,470
could do that better that was nailed it

1024
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,580
to sum it up Wow as you put it thank you

1025
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,700
all right all right yeah I was gonna be

1026
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,500
my follow up question is you know can we

1027
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,970
have your slides please so that we can

1028
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,190
reuse them and also read them half but

1029
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:53,750
mostly reuse them also I think I sent I

1030
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,060
sent them in last night yeah I was

1031
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,220
asking on behalf of the crew at partly

1032
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,510
tongue-in-cheek as well but yeah that

1033
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,430
that whole visual communication piece

1034
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,680
like you do an amazing job of that just

1035
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,240
in your own slides but I think the way

1036
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,650
that you actually walk through that and

1037
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,780
explain why it's important was was

1038
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,000
really powerfully though in practice

1039
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,190
thanks I appreciate that yeah awesome

1040
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,590
fuzzy hey um there's one more question

1041
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,840
and I'm kind of interested to hear this

1042
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,160
one too and I feel like I've struggled

1043
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,890
with that myself definitely working as a

1044
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:28,800
pen tester there it's from oh x2 I'm

1045
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,590
probably butchering the name but he's

1046
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,510
very active on our discord and

1047
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:36,360
everything and lovely guy and he said

1048
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,300
being a happy being a hacker and being a

1049
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,250
corporate person are opposites by

1050
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,200
opposite sides of the spectrum

1051
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,160
how do you manage that yeah I mean I

1052
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,540
think that's a slightly dangerous

1053
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,120
assumption to say that two things are

1054
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,940
opposite sides of the spectrum right

1055
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,350
because if if we think like that then it

1056
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,490
limits us to be one or the other and if

1057
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,380
we are limited by that then then it's

1058
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,020
not manageable we we can only be one or

1059
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,600
the other and you know this idea that we

1060
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,160
are a hacker like it's not something

1061
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,730
we're gonna give up ever right and if we

1062
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,200
think that they are opposite sides of

1063
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,970
the spectrum then we're never gonna be

1064
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:23,270
able to be like a corporate person - I

1065
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,910
mean I think the presentation is is my

1066
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,830
way of saying the way to manage that is

1067
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,190
to be like a chameleon right to stay who

1068
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,560
you are but blend into your environment

1069
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,930
when you need to just like any other

1070
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,390
skill you know just like blending into a

1071
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,910
to a Windows environment after you've

1072
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,560
cracked that perimeter or blending into

1073
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,290
an environment and looking like the

1074
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,460
other things that are in the environment

1075
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,450
just to get something done so yeah I

1076
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,410
don't think they're mutually exclusive

1077
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:59,650
yes I totally agree that I I guess like

1078
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:04,539
I guess like well while I understand

1079
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:06,160
where he's coming from with that

1080
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,819
question like these days being a hacker

1081
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:12,039
and getting paid to do it is a is a

1082
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:14,500
consulting job a lot of the time and

1083
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,390
that thinks obstacles are huge part of

1084
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,950
that and I think I think that's why you

1085
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,740
touched on like in this talk is like

1086
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,539
having people skills is almost as

1087
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:24,190
important or even more important than

1088
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,690
being able to hack if you're getting

1089
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:30,760
paid for it yeah I mean we I think are

1090
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,099
we're all striving to be kind of

1091
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:36,010
complete right and we all want to have

1092
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:38,289
kind of all of the different skills and

1093
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,640
all of the different things so that we

1094
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,339
can we can do anything we want right and

1095
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:43,769
have that with that kind of limitless

1096
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:46,630
lifestyle in which we are able to to go

1097
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,700
we don't feel like parts of the world or

1098
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,450
things are cut off from us so I mean

1099
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,069
it's it's hard I'll spend my whole life

1100
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:57,849
trying to trying to do it I encourage or

1101
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:01,750
I hope some of you do as well yeah hey

1102
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,000
just another personal question for me

1103
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,460
I love all of the content that you gave

1104
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:10,089
about basically like hacking people and

1105
00:44:10,089 --> 00:44:14,079
to put it bluntly but you mention a few

1106
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,150
books and things like that that have

1107
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,599
obviously inspired you to think this way

1108
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,900
but when you're just dealing with people

1109
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,430
day to day is that something that you're

1110
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,170
consciously thinking about like a you

1111
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,609
are you thinking oh this is that

1112
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:29,349
situation that I've read about in a book

1113
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:31,089
and like I'm gonna apply this technique

1114
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:32,829
or is it more something that you feel

1115
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:35,710
you've kind of developed as instinctual

1116
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,269
over the years so instincts only come

1117
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:42,519
with lots and lots of practice right and

1118
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:45,789
so what I do is I I will decide what I

1119
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:47,829
want to like work on right and then I

1120
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:51,700
will find an audio book that like is in

1121
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,529
that genre or category or that thing

1122
00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:55,299
that I want to work on and then like on

1123
00:44:55,299 --> 00:44:57,400
my way to work or as I'm starting today

1124
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,259
I'll listen to a little bit of it and

1125
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:01,299
I'll have like some fresh stuff in my

1126
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:02,559
mind and then I can hopefully like

1127
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:03,940
practice those things throughout the day

1128
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,009
and that's kind of I just use it to like

1129
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:08,049
shift my mind state into a different

1130
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:09,220
place but I I'm not

1131
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,950
able to like go back and recall pieces

1132
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,300
of a book or I'm always thinking about

1133
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:19,060
that that's how I give it oh yeah

1134
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,290
awesome another another question from

1135
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,020
from I think from the community you

1136
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,359
mentioned that you got fired before your

1137
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,240
current gig and someone is asked what

1138
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,950
techniques did you use to deal with and

1139
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:37,440
overcome that so yeah love to hear that

1140
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,380
yeah so I mean I guess to talk about the

1141
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,390
techniques to overcome it I have to talk

1142
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,960
a little bit about what it's like and

1143
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,640
you know it's kind of blindsiding right

1144
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,810
so a big part of what of what happens is

1145
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:55,000
you you have to justify to yourself that

1146
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,859
you're still accurate you're still okay

1147
00:45:56,859 --> 00:45:58,599
right and you have to try and think like

1148
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,070
how is this failure going to move

1149
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,840
forward and that's not an easy thing to

1150
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,180
do when you have this kind of this

1151
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,810
failure still in front of you so for me

1152
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,940
it just became about focusing on on the

1153
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,570
future right and I don't think I really

1154
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,950
got over it

1155
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,750
until I was able to prove to myself that

1156
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,460
like the first time around wasn't a

1157
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,040
fluke and that I I belong here I mean I

1158
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,359
feel like if like we all feel this way

1159
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:24,670
you know a bit of impostor syndrome like

1160
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,070
do we really belong was it just luck and

1161
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,640
I think accepting the in part it's luck

1162
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,640
I mean some some of it is luck we have

1163
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,740
to have some luck to get to where we're

1164
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,000
going we have to have luck for

1165
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,240
opportunities to open up but we can we

1166
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,830
can influence that amount of luck by

1167
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,080
trying and not being afraid to fail over

1168
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,180
and over again and hopefully we get some

1169
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,950
kind of proof that allows us to feel

1170
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:52,060
better about ourselves in the end yeah I

1171
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,670
love that so much and like you know the

1172
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,250
luck thing I think like most of life

1173
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,500
comes down to luck in some ways in that

1174
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,240
like we're lucky to be alive at all

1175
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,730
we're lucky to exist and like we're

1176
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,589
lucky to have had the experiences that

1177
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:08,619
have led us into this career path we're

1178
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:11,109
lucky to have you know happened to be

1179
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:13,300
born in the country that we're born in

1180
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,190
to get the job that way that we get you

1181
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,080
know all of these different things lined

1182
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,580
up for us to be in the exact position

1183
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,790
and the exact time and everything that

1184
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:22,240
we're in

1185
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,980
right now like just the chances of us

1186
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,740
being alive are unimaginably small so

1187
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,110
like you know when you're talking about

1188
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,119
getting into a specific Korea that's

1189
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,830
like the next level right that's like

1190
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:36,670
completely completely next level alright

1191
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:37,960
um do you mind if I give you another

1192
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,369
question just from just from the

1193
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:40,890
audience

1194
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:46,869
sure so this is an interesting one it's

1195
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:49,869
kind of open and ended but I like it for

1196
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:52,540
some reason so it's from Galactic omelet

1197
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,060
which is an excellent handle I must say

1198
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,910
would you say that managing and hacking

1199
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,520
others is just about just as much about

1200
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,860
managing and hacking yourself yeah I

1201
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,850
think that's a great a great quote and

1202
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:12,010
you know if we are blind to ourselves we

1203
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,869
will never be able to see the things we

1204
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:16,210
need to in others and if we cannot

1205
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:20,560
manage ourselves yeah 100% agree that's

1206
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:33,430
awesome question Casey yeah so there's

1207
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:37,150
another one here what sorry I'm reading

1208
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:42,490
it as as it is so I'm at the grammar

1209
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,540
might be a little bit off or whatever

1210
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,760
but what happens when you can stand

1211
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,270
politics and is always fighting for

1212
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,770
mediocracy in a corporate world that is

1213
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,320
always moved by politics and game can

1214
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,730
you comment on that so I think what

1215
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:58,600
they're saying is like we're living in a

1216
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,500
world where basically mediocracy in the

1217
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,260
corporate world is like you know they're

1218
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,990
going to standard and definitely like

1219
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,510
not not so much corporation not so much

1220
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,190
businesses I've worked for but

1221
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,750
definitely like businesses that I've

1222
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,910
been planted in as part of my work I

1223
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,250
found that like mediocrity is like the

1224
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,140
default for most people they just I just

1225
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,210
want to turn up to work I just want to

1226
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:26,140
like do their job and whatever how do

1227
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,490
you fight that how do you get around

1228
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:29,980
that how do you inspire people to like

1229
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,380
do better all that kind of stuff

1230
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,290
I mean this this very much comes down to

1231
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:41,610
acceptance right because we you know

1232
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,980
perhaps we are critical and we judge

1233
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,470
ourselves to a very high level that's

1234
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:49,170
how we push ourselves and we turn that

1235
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,290
lens on other people too right and and

1236
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,390
it's easy to look out across the vast

1237
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,220
swath of different people and just to

1238
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,670
say oh like I'm living in this world of

1239
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,170
institutionalized corporate mediocrity

1240
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,810
and everyone sucks and everyone's bland

1241
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,780
and blah blah blah right but it like the

1242
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,790
thing I find the helps is to say like

1243
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,080
you know what everyone's doing their

1244
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,240
best everyone's doing their best and

1245
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,680
they have their own things that they

1246
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,080
care about and it's not my place to try

1247
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,120
and change their priorities or what they

1248
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,400
care about but rather to like align

1249
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,930
myself to the things that I care about

1250
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,870
and do those things this fight of what

1251
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:27,630
it's like basically you rely on people

1252
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,520
to do their best and if you can measure

1253
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,040
what that best is then you can realign

1254
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,770
your expectations with the reality of of

1255
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:40,320
your peers or companies or liberties yes

1256
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,760
I guess lower expectations

1257
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,210
yes I'm no such as this chat was like

1258
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,680
we're just waiting for Casey to drop

1259
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,140
some knowledge in here to having similar

1260
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,310
to yourself you've got very similar

1261
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,040
approaches to this like business and

1262
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,230
experience and blending the the hacker

1263
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,720
side to the business side and I know I

1264
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,580
get a lot of knowledge from that having

1265
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,620
transition from pen tests and leaning on

1266
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,210
Casey but to help me transition to

1267
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,280
imagine well Casey what's your what's

1268
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,390
your take on this whole what are you

1269
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,970
what do you think oh look you know a

1270
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:11,460
plus plus plus would listen to Josh

1271
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,060
again as as expected

1272
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,580
now look I mean on the topic I don't

1273
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,890
want to hijack the talk by any stretch

1274
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,450
of the imagination but you know

1275
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:25,650
thoroughly agree like I often explain

1276
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,350
like even entrepreneurship and founding

1277
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:32,940
as using a similar set of skills and the

1278
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,350
similar set of kind of you know

1279
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:37,160
components is like just how people think

1280
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,140
you start here you want to end here

1281
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,240
you've got this limited set of things to

1282
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,590
work with and you got all the [ __ ] in

1283
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,240
your way and your job is to create a

1284
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,239
path from A to B it's it's similar

1285
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:50,699
you know I think in terms of like

1286
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:53,369
exploiting in the positive sense the

1287
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:55,439
corporate culture to be able to get the

1288
00:51:55,439 --> 00:51:58,169
outcomes that you think best as it is

1289
00:51:58,169 --> 00:51:59,789
you know creating a new category in the

1290
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:03,809
market so and you know like the big

1291
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:06,989
thing Joshua's just say Joshua just

1292
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:10,369
saying now is the whole like I think

1293
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:14,519
hackers just in general there's the

1294
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:15,689
strong undertone of like

1295
00:52:15,689 --> 00:52:16,679
anti-establishment

1296
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:18,269
it's like ah everything because you know

1297
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:19,739
a lot of what we do is about what's

1298
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:21,689
broken right so it's it sort of makes

1299
00:52:21,689 --> 00:52:23,609
sense that's part of how we communicate

1300
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:24,869
and it's part about DNA and it's

1301
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:26,099
actually it's a powerful and a good

1302
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:29,549
thing but you know definitely a mining

1303
00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:33,299
my experience going from you know this

1304
00:52:33,299 --> 00:52:37,049
enthusiastic kind of rookie who saw an

1305
00:52:37,049 --> 00:52:38,759
opportunity to change a bunch of stuff

1306
00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:40,319
to learning the hat like learning how to

1307
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,319
actually do that some of the most dense

1308
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:44,879
and challenging learning that I've had

1309
00:52:44,879 --> 00:52:47,399
to do and to Josh's talk like sometimes

1310
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:49,889
it involves actually all the time really

1311
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:51,869
it's just like continuous stream of

1312
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:55,439
things that feel very unnatural this is

1313
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:56,789
not what I normally do I'd normally just

1314
00:52:56,789 --> 00:52:58,289
like head but this thing because that

1315
00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:00,419
solution is stupid and my one is good or

1316
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:02,579
like those sorts of things that I think

1317
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:05,159
are just innate to people that have you

1318
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:07,289
know opinions in this space which is

1319
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:10,619
probably most of us right so yeah I mean

1320
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:12,659
not to you know ramble on about it too

1321
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:15,179
much longer but like I think it just

1322
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:18,239
straight down the line I think really

1323
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:20,879
what what I liked about this talk is

1324
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:23,789
that it's obviously in the corporate

1325
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:25,589
industrial complex but really it's a

1326
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:27,239
talk about professionalism it's a talk

1327
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:29,459
really about growing up and actually

1328
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:31,649
increasing your impact I tweeted a quote

1329
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:34,169
that you put in there Josh about you

1330
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,539
know if we can take like in increments

1331
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:40,049
these sort of more boring or mundane or

1332
00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:41,909
unnatural feeling things and combine

1333
00:53:41,909 --> 00:53:44,039
them with these like very powerful

1334
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:47,129
technical superpowers that we've got

1335
00:53:47,129 --> 00:53:49,589
then were capable of more impact with

1336
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:51,569
that and like I'm personally motivated

1337
00:53:51,569 --> 00:53:53,339
by the pursuit of potential so that's

1338
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:55,499
that's sort of how I how I got to where

1339
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:58,259
I am here and you know very much intend

1340
00:53:58,259 --> 00:54:00,119
to keep on going with that so yeah I

1341
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:02,350
love the talk

1342
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:05,620
Thanks hey I got a got a last question

1343
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,200
though maybe or maybe we've got a couple

1344
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,740
of one but my question is primarily all

1345
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,800
these skills that comes from like your

1346
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,080
would Maurice Verizon media that's a big

1347
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,150
corporation there's big room for you to

1348
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,770
evolve but let's say that you're in

1349
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,450
corporation and you're feeling that

1350
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,890
you're maybe you're getting stuck like

1351
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,350
you're maybe you're leveling out when do

1352
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,940
you personally think it's it's time to

1353
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,880
jump ship or like when do you really

1354
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,150
reach the level of comfort versus that

1355
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,520
hunger to to develop or grow as a person

1356
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,030
and do you have any tips for anyone that

1357
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:46,000
feels stuck in that area sure I mean to

1358
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,490
jump ship I think often we think it

1359
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,740
means to like quit to the company to

1360
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,710
quit to the job right and but in but in

1361
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,240
essence when we feel like that's our

1362
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,890
only choice we're a little bit trapped

1363
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,930
right like oh my only choice is to quit

1364
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,270
and I think we shouldn't think about it

1365
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,790
like the quitting out right but but

1366
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,530
rather just pursuing the things that are

1367
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,020
interesting to us anything we should we

1368
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,460
should be able to ask ourselves like

1369
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,320
what is the thing I really want to be -

1370
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,750
like what is essential to my life that I

1371
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,640
would that I want to but I want to

1372
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,740
occupy my time with and am I doing that

1373
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,480
and if you're not doing that you can

1374
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,340
look for ways to do it in the job you

1375
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,200
have you can look for opportunities to

1376
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,710
do it elsewhere so so really it's about

1377
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:29,260
being able to pursue the things that you

1378
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,300
care about and if you're not able to do

1379
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,370
that and you can't find any place in the

1380
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,500
current environment then then maybe it's

1381
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,450
time to look elsewhere but don't don't

1382
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:38,830
leave because just because you feel

1383
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,780
stuck right look for that look for the

1384
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,520
operation look for the option inside

1385
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,590
look for it elsewhere but leave because

1386
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,090
you're pursuing something not because

1387
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:51,210
you're yes this is a brilliant phrase I

1388
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:53,950
picked up from a mental a long time ago

1389
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,720
it's like it's easy to be defined by

1390
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,170
what you're against but there's there's

1391
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:01,030
this power and this skill and there's

1392
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,770
actually opportunity and in learning how

1393
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,380
to be defined what you're for which is

1394
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,180
kind of packages up a little bit of what

1395
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,530
you just said dude too hard agree on

1396
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,680
that

1397
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,500
okay cool so thank you very much for for

1398
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,290
having that makes it talked for us and I

1399
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,510
hope all of you made sure that your

1400
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,310
screen captured as much as possible if

1401
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,810
you're ready to move into the corporate

1402
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,990
world

1403
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:38,119
