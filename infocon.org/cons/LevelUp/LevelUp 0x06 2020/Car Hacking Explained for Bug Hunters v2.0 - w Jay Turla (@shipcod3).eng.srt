[Music]

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,910
next up jato Ellijay is our in-house

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,130
he's he runs a team at bugcrowd he's our

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,510
in-house hardware mind blowing guru he

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,310
does you know if you if you participate

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,590
to a kayaking programme unity' with J at

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,380
some point he has spoken in Elkhorn and

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,939
has this amazing wealth of knowledge on

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,309
this subject and personally just having

11
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:36,030
experience with one who can do I'm

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,140
really excited for this so I think it's

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,910
gonna be a great talk and taken away J

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,840
thanks Michael for introducing me I'm so

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,700
excited to talk about this topic and let

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,090
me just share my screen right now and by

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,470
the way I'm sorry for the background

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,830
noise it's currently 6 a.m. here in the

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,690
Philippines so that's why you can hear

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,990
the roosters crowing right now my

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,800
apologies for that

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,579
[Music]

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,150
just a note we can't see the screen yet

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,500
as well you need to be gosh I'm sorry

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,630
yep is amazing yeah total pot to the

26
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,490
plus yep so my topic is sort of motive

27
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,890
security bugs explain for bug hunters

28
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,950
version 2.0 and the reason the reason

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,590
why it's 2.0 is because I've already

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,930
actually presented this at närcon but

31
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,530
the reason why it's 2.0 is that I've

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,170
revamped the slides and also added other

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,280
tools and also other information about

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,930
what amount of security bugs and this

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,049
presentation is actually gonna

36
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,659
I'm gonna give you a perspective on how

37
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,639
we look on bugs based on a car hacking

38
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,940
program or a bug - so I'm actually using

39
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,129
the car hacking village logo as well

40
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,040
because I got involved with car hacking

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,379
village as well here in the Philippines

42
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,080
and also with the folks that I've met in

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,560
DEFCON car hacking village is like a

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,890
Disneyland for me and also DEFCON as

45
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,920
well so Who am I I'm Jay Turla that's my

46
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,140
twitter handle and and work on they call

47
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,410
me jet man and basically I'm a security

48
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,950
office manager for bugcrowd and I handle

49
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,140
the aasa' team here in the Philippines

50
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,150
I'm also a root convert an ACF peer

51
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,700
reviewer I'm not the author of Turla

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,730
malware I received this the ants in

53
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,989
Twitter like 2013 or 2012 before but I

54
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,329
just tell them that no I'm not even

55
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:15,230
Russian I'm Filipino so and like I said

56
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,650
I've also helped develop Metasploit

57
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,889
modules or contribute to Metasploit

58
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:24,359
module stand in fact last year I've

59
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,470
actually pushed a a module related to

60
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,650
car hacking and you can also see me at

61
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,500
hacker conferences and also you know any

62
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,989
virtual conference right now since kovat

63
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:47,359
so here it goes this is actually the

64
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,709
or hacking village and Rukh Khan and you

65
00:03:53,709 --> 00:04:00,330
know this was last year and we actually

66
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,700
taught the people or some attendees how

67
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,739
to read the can

68
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,129
I mean how to do scan sniffing can in

69
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:12,040
the middle attacks of can floods and how

70
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,069
to fuzz a real hardware with simulators

71
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:20,649
and instrument clusters and also we have

72
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,530
an actual ECU simulator to this hardware

73
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,229
based and through my friends I earn

74
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:27,580
money and Niccolo bogum

75
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,550
we were able to show the attendees how

76
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,030
when an anomaly detection system works

77
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,000
which which is a kind of a system that

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,820
allows you to detect if someone is like

79
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,770
spoofing messages or sending malicious

80
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,360
messages it's really cool

81
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,550
so anyway why car hacking I mean I think

82
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,550
most we have have some questions about

83
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,310
this basically it's a fun community car

84
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,470
hacking we'll just been giving a lot of

85
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,370
information tutorials about car hacking

86
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,780
how to open how to use devices for

87
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,380
sniffing the can and also like you know

88
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,889
they also have a CTF like events where

89
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:17,919
in they pay pay I mean they reward

90
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,479
hackers with actual Tesla cars or even

91
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,560
you know black badges as well and

92
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,330
because we use it every day we want to

93
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,570
ensure that we are actually safe from

94
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,070
attack so that's why I have some you

95
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,530
know interest in for hacking and there

96
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,630
are actually a lot of attack surfaces

97
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,139
for cars I will discuss on that later on

98
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,150
and then if bugs are out says that my

99
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,910
other computer it is your computer it's

100
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,500
basically my my other computer is their

101
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,169
car's computer because it has

102
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,569
ivi or it has Linux boxes like

103
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,479
infotainment systems and telematics so

104
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:15,789
there's some computers on it and then

105
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:18,740
from my experience our car hacking bugs

106
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,409
I should say well so I might I may not

107
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:25,099
be an expert in car hacking really but I

108
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:28,699
have a I have been active in car hacking

109
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,240
bug bashes and also you know met most of

110
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,349
the car hackers in the scene because of

111
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,659
bug bashes and I think bug ground for

112
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:44,300
that so like I said cars have IOT - or

113
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,449
Internet of Things so basically that's

114
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,030
another attack surface so that's why we

115
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,349
want to test on a course or you know

116
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:56,590
play on

117
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,310
so this is a sample screenshot that I

118
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,220
got from the previous bug - that we have

119
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,750
last year and we actually paid like two

120
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,180
hundred and twenty four thousand US

121
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,870
dollars and so what you can see these

122
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,470
are the researchers so did it the top

123
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,910
ten and you know the the top one was

124
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,790
able to earn 120 points for this bug -

125
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,540
and it's really one of the you know it's

126
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,370
one of the best thing to see car hackers

127
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,200
totally hacker or bypass something

128
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,480
and if you want to like dive into car

129
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,780
hacking you don't know where to start or

130
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,000
you don't know

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,780
you know what to what to use what tools

132
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,719
do you need to use so what kind of like

133
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,770
thinks that you can actually work on

134
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,830
with some of the devices available so

135
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,830
this is one of the best books that I

136
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,360
could actually advise so its decor

137
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,030
hacker's handbook it's by craig smith

138
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,910
and there's a picture of him there

139
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,190
that's actually me and my friend who is

140
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,960
also one of the organizers in the car

141
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,840
hacking village in the Philippines we

142
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,190
gave him a shot for his talk so yeah

143
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,900
drink all the booze and hack all the

144
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:39,589
things then basically Craig Smith in

145
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,760
that book he actually also posted or

146
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,470
written the combat attack surfaces in a

147
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,690
car so you have the celluloid you have

148
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,510
the Wi-Fi you have the Bluetooth you

149
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,820
have the TPMS or a tire pressure

150
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,610
monitoring system and then you have the

151
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,620
key key s and then aside from the

152
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,720
external things that you can do you have

153
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,959
the internal attack surfaces so take for

154
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,529
example the infotainment the nav console

155
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,870
even the USB port so the Universal

156
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,459
Serial bus that's also an attack

157
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,430
surfaces and then you have the obd2

158
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,459
connector so how do you usually find

159
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:28,250
that it's usually in the the bottom of

160
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,250
the steering wheel or maybe at the side

161
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,770
so it depends so that there are actually

162
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,810
pictures you can google where and where

163
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,720
you can find obd2 but if you can't find

164
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,230
that how do you you know do can testing

165
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,770
without having access to obd2 so

166
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,730
basically maybe

167
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,449
test some some Wars that are there

168
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:53,399
externally for the car maybe you can rip

169
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,889
off some of the sensors and then just

170
00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:00,059
grab a multi tester and then check if

171
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,410
it's traveling on 1.5 volts or 1.25 or

172
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,169
over that and if you see that it's

173
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:11,339
traveling 1.5 volts for example from one

174
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,499
of the wires that you rip off that means

175
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:16,609
that there is scan in there and in fact

176
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:19,410
there are many ways that you could

177
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,850
attack from there maybe the brake lights

178
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,720
open the door

179
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,600
externally by just ripping off so I

180
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,069
can't divulge much of the attacks that I

181
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:34,379
was able to see in the bug - but you

182
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,449
know I will just share some insights

183
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:42,290
about it and you know here's a graph I

184
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,329
just was able to grab this one from

185
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:48,389
Argus SEC and that's what you can see

186
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:51,209
you have the air this is a more detailed

187
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,989
attack surface of the connected vehicle

188
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:57,179
so you have the radio the TCU the

189
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:59,489
transmission control unit you have the

190
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:02,339
ECU or the engine control unit then you

191
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,359
have the vehicle the vehicle

192
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:06,809
communication by the controller locks

193
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:12,419
lights etc obd2 basically these are the

194
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:14,819
most common as well so it's more

195
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:17,118
detailed

196
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,900
then we'll head on to the next slide so

197
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,570
for bugcrowd because we have you know we

198
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,690
have been involved with creating bug

199
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,390
bashes not me but bug ground itself I

200
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:34,010
just you know triage issues in the bug -

201
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,120
so basically we have these common

202
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,500
classifications we have the p1 for

203
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,890
infotainment if it's a PII leakage and

204
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,480
then we have if you could clone the key

205
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,100
fob so that's p1 as well and then if you

206
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,050
could pivot to the canvas with the

207
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,880
infotainment like you were able to

208
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,400
execute arbitrary commands and then

209
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,490
people from there execute some canned

210
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,730
messages so that usually a reward that

211
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,160
one SB - and then p5 examples we have

212
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,470
the roll jam attacks the replay attacks

213
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,960
and we have the other attacks as well

214
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,400
for the RF of the infotainment and the

215
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,480
can so if you are if you have like can

216
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,630
injection you could dust the ECU for

217
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,800
example so that's a p4 issue now you

218
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,980
might you might you may not be able to

219
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,330
see that there's other people can hear

220
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,180
basically because we already have a VRT

221
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,550
entry for authenticate autentic ation

222
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,080
bypass which is p1 so that's why

223
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,330
automatically if someone was able to you

224
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,290
know

225
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,950
is the security access control for cars

226
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,230
like being able to bypass the firewall

227
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,530
for a car or an SG ee so that's

228
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,190
automatically a p1 or another tenth

229
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,390
ocation bypass issue so that's why we

230
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,060
just didn't add another one geared for

231
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,370
cars because it would it would just

232
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,980
sound a duplicate entry for a BRT so it

233
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,310
was I who together with Dax Labrador who

234
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,470
is a former ASE who actually added this

235
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,980
one and follows well one of my teammates

236
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,730
Paul how I mean he was the one who

237
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:42,180
committed this one so now like I said

238
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,240
it's not just about the can

239
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,540
other

240
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,150
that you could try in an in a bug - so

241
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,160
like I said if you could bypass the

242
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,470
authentication mechanism for security

243
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,070
gateways or hormones so it's a peel one

244
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,830
like you're not supposed to access that

245
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,000
that surface or like you were able to

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,459
send a certain frame and then you were

247
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,130
able to trigger the brake lights you

248
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,610
were able to train a brake sounds or the

249
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,910
law I mean the alarms of the car that

250
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,890
breaks down is what alarms in the car so

251
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,080
that's a pin one and then if you are

252
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,740
able to jump the bootloader for security

253
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,810
gateways or firewalls that's a p1 as

254
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,500
well and if you are able to program the

255
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,410
ECU by back bypassing the Gateway that's

256
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,740
still a few on and then of course

257
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,899
because if it's a connected car it has

258
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,300
some app

259
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,070
you can download to sync with your car

260
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,740
right so it varies so if you have

261
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,050
Android or iOS vulnerabilities if you

262
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,890
are good in mobile security so here's

263
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,630
here's the thing that you could try as

264
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,210
well so if you don't have much knowledge

265
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,720
in CAD you could also dive into the

266
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,790
mobile vulnerabilities that is connected

267
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,240
to your for an app that is connected to

268
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,300
your car so there was this issue with

269
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,510
Nissan Leaf before it's fixed right now

270
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,030
so Cory hunt and his friend actually

271
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,890
basically they were able to you know

272
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,100
found out that you can actually control

273
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,840
your the Nissan Leaf car with an app and

274
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,750
when they tried to when they tried to

275
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,490
like sniff the app there's an endpoint

276
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,170
where there is actually

277
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,860
but that calls the VIN number of a car

278
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,439
the VIN number of their car itself so if

279
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:58,889
you are able to like figure out one of

280
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,709
the VIN numbers of a Nissan Leaf you

281
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:05,129
could actually control another car for

282
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:09,600
them so the fix for that is not the

283
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,749
security issue of a VIN but the end but

284
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:15,990
that end point which doesn't which

285
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,809
doesn't have authentication so basically

286
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:22,439
that's that's an issue related to web

287
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,199
vulnerabilities in a mobile app because

288
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,089
from that mobile app they were able to

289
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,579
discover that there's an endpoint that

290
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,259
allows you to call any VIN numbers so

291
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:38,399
how was it able to you know access other

292
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,800
cars so because they have telematics

293
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,829
module and then for web vulnerabilities

294
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:46,769
again so it could be connected to the

295
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:50,040
cloud the telematics the firmware update

296
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,350
server so take for example what if the

297
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,949
firmware update server has a SQL

298
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,949
injection vulnerability so basically

299
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:03,149
it's gonna be become a p1 issue it's

300
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:05,020
gonna get

301
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,640
kind of rating that they have from the

302
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,819
web vulnerabilities in the VRT or the

303
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,290
vulnerability rating taxonomy

304
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,470
anyways um I hope I'm not boring you

305
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,150
here are some of the ends insights that

306
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,520
I've actually found on the net and some

307
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,699
of the demos that I've used are actually

308
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,900
from my car itself as well and you know

309
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,350
I hope that you will try this and I hope

310
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,590
you don't break the car so try this at

311
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,520
your own risk

312
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,940
basically in a BMW three-30 I so if you

313
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,230
name your phone

314
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,840
- like % x % x % x % x and then connect

315
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,100
your phone to a BMW 3 3 0 i so it will

316
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,840
cause the infotainment to crash it will

317
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,650
brick your device and thanks to this

318
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:08,170
researcher we know about this one so

319
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,570
this is an issue between the Bluetooth

320
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,340
stacks of the infotainment system

321
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:22,870
yes and this actually from my car so

322
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,850
basically if you have infotainment

323
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,080
default creds sometimes it's an issue

324
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,960
sometimes it isn't but basically we have

325
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,330
a VRT for insecure transmissions so what

326
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,220
if you could prove to the program owner

327
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,799
that hey one of your infotainment system

328
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,799
allows me to tell that or you know work

329
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,460
with FTP so basically you have there

330
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,070
that you can actually prove that there

331
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,750
is insecure transmission on an

332
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,380
infotainment so that's possible it's

333
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,150
possible that you can be rewarded for

334
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,419
that and if you know the root password

335
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:02,320
maybe you could pivot from there to

336
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,210
interact with a can so if you have

337
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,320
access to the infotainment maybe you

338
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,950
could like pivot to the system and then

339
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,010
interact percent and messages to your

340
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,590
car I would say that that could become a

341
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,510
feature if you're able to do that

342
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:27,040
like maybe trip up the the brake lights

343
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,780
or trip off the alarms or the airbags if

344
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,260
you could do that then yep how about the

345
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:42,390
p1 as well this is from my car again so

346
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,400
because if you are not able to pivot so

347
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,190
this could become a p3 so if you're only

348
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,080
able to execute arbitrary commands

349
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,750
because for example if the system is

350
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,490
like sandbox and you are not able to

351
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:59,440
just you know send canned messages so

352
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,190
basically just

353
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,060
just being able to execute arbitrary

354
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,690
commands on the infotainment so that's

355
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,090
that's something that is p3 so I have a

356
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,250
video actually about this one and here

357
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,430
so this is the chicken that the rooster

358
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,290
that you keep on hearing actually

359
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,420
you

360
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,450
Oh

361
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,010
oh wait I think it's crashing sorry

362
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,440
not sure

363
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:52,730
and you guys still hear me I guess we

364
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,080
can stay here okay

365
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,280
I think the Apple is tossing a dose but

366
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,960
I know I mean it's the video lag but let

367
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,750
me tried it again sorry for that one

368
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:14,460
okay it's okay now so this is the PLC

369
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,740
not sure why it's this is happening but

370
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,180
so we can we can link that on your

371
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,700
Twitter and in the discord after and so

372
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,960
for anyone watching this on the

373
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,240
recording ship code will have his

374
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,610
Twitter at the beginning on the end and

375
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,960
the link to this video be in the

376
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,140
comments on the video you know sorry

377
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,820
about that one let me just close the

378
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,220
quicktime player again and you know

379
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:52,260
I hear it's working now so basically I

380
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,610
was able to insert a you know a flash

381
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,470
drive on the car and then you know

382
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:09,020
trigger command injection so let's just

383
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,850
this forward there we go

384
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,740
and

385
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,320
[Music]

386
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,880
d I was able to execute my name space -

387
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,920
a so that's if you can do that

388
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,140
that's a p3 but if you could like move

389
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,230
further being able to send canned

390
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:41,110
messages so it's a p2 again sorry for

391
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,040
the technical difficulties so logical

392
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,940
but so like I said you see your resets

393
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,880
you if you are able to do that bypass so

394
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,700
that's a big one as well and Chris

395
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,130
valasek and Charlie Miller has a book

396
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,870
about advanced scan injection attacks

397
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,919
which could help so there's a link on

398
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,169
that and then I don't have a PLC about

399
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:13,809
this one but I was able to see so I

400
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,910
can't divulge other issues that were

401
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,900
found in the book back for NBA purposes

402
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,580
but to help you with that

403
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,400
there's a tool that I love it allows you

404
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,850
to you know fuzz something or like you

405
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,919
know maybe get the CT of the car there's

406
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,870
a tool that I love really there's

407
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,130
another one called yeah yet which is yet

408
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,370
another car hacking tool this one is my

409
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,020
favorite because it's just a command

410
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,970
line and basically I have a VM running

411
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,720
right now so this is the

412
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,140
in Caribou so these are the things that

413
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,250
you could do so if you run the test

414
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,140
module of carrying caribou you could

415
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,890
actually send this diagnostic services

416
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:09,140
and then also fuzz the UDS so if we try

417
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:17,740
to you know run UDS Discovery

418
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,179
so it will try to fuzz arbitration IDs

419
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:24,799
so this is just a virtual one because

420
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,490
I'm running a UDS a server so what you

421
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:35,530
can see with trying to send this can

422
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,500
this arbitration I do 24 a and then this

423
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,400
is the can-can I can frame which is 0 to

424
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:50,179
1 0 0 1 and there we got a request with

425
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:54,580
7d f7 e 0 and

426
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,180
basically we were able to send

427
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,760
diagnostic session control to seven one

428
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,690
zero which is the ID 7 D F and 7 e zero

429
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,980
and if we do a can dump Mike and dump is

430
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,310
ready running so there these are they

431
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,230
add arbitration IDs that we were able to

432
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:22,220
send and we got a response from 770 a

433
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:28,070
arbitration ID so 7 1 0 7 b f70 easier

434
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,630
those order UDS that you can actually

435
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,220
you know try so there are other things

436
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,630
that you could do and in fact if you try

437
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,200
UDS minus H there's actually things a

438
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,740
ticket like security seed you see your

439
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,890
reset so if you could do an ECU reset

440
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,920
then bypass the firewall so that's a p1

441
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,800
so those are just you know tips and

442
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,570
tricks with this tool I'm gonna do some

443
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,930
demo later on but here are the

444
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,180
prerequisites for the demo it's just a

445
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,550
video actually I have an instrument

446
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,090
cluster with nano can I would like to

447
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,520
thank mint Annette for actually teaching

448
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,060
me how to you know how to solder this

449
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,169
one and also how to

450
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:29,519
they have some Arduino and then hook it

451
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,929
up so fuzzy my instrument cluster so if

452
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:36,690
you want to start car hacking like if

453
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,789
you don't want to buy the whole ECU back

454
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:41,820
you can actually just buy an instrument

455
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,590
cluster it costs like 20 $20 $30 $40 $50

456
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,269
so it's car hacking on the cheap and

457
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:52,590
then if you get a nano can we give it

458
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,159
for free if you find me in other in any

459
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,590
conference I actually give nano can

460
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:03,889
PCBs and then you just need to buy the

461
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:07,169
the parts like the Arduino Nano and the

462
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:10,320
mCP to five one five module these are

463
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,779
the tools from the right side of the

464
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,809
pictures that I sent in the slide so I

465
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:18,779
have contact I have stm32 can sniffer my

466
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,480
tech maker so these guys are really good

467
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,490
the guys from check maker as well and

468
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,669
the value can for from intrepid control

469
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:33,090
systems so if you have an Anakin and you

470
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,730
have any SL can devices just like the

471
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,880
one that I flash on the video so you

472
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,679
could actually try the demo that I will

473
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,769
be demonstrating later on or showing

474
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,049
also there's a good resource that

475
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:53,360
actually it contains videos

476
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,410
presentations in Def Con and other

477
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,990
hacking conference tools open source

478
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,410
libraries that you can start to learn

479
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,880
car hacking so I would definitely advise

480
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,860
to read some of the links there or you

481
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,570
know buy some of the tools that you get

482
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,840
there

483
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:20,410
so Jay gambling or Gerry gamblin also

484
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,930
you know created a vm machine that allow

485
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,750
that comes with pre-installed car

486
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,620
hacking tools

487
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,410
so if you just want to have if you have

488
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,080
a Linux back box so you just need to

489
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,790
clone it if you don't want to install

490
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,600
app-v machine

491
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,600
and if you want to use Metasploit you

492
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,480
could actually use Metasploit as well to

493
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,179
test Craig Smith actually dev modules to

494
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:58,500
test car hacking and basically so let me

495
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,370
just get to my slide

496
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,040
so here are the

497
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,580
motive modules in Metasploit and as what

498
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,640
you can see there is can flood their

499
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,080
scan probe

500
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,120
there's get vehicle information and if

501
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,060
we try to run can flood right now with

502
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,000
my virtual virtual can because I'm using

503
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,830
the virtual can't just for demo purposes

504
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,630
I don't want to try this under ECU's

505
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:26,620
that I have so let's try well I'm

506
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:32,440
running the can dump so I'll try to run

507
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:39,160
this one so and we have some of the

508
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,190
things that it's actually doing so if

509
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,490
you are able to flood the bus and you

510
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,190
can really see that there's a dose you

511
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,860
can actually do dose so that's something

512
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,230
that we reward and another old hack that

513
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,590
we have if you are able to write a while

514
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:05,140
statement and then send can frames with

515
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,220
zero I mean for example the can frame is

516
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,280
zero zero zero zero with eight bytes and

517
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,740
then you have the can ID or the

518
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,800
arbitration ideas zero as well it's

519
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,540
possible that you could actually dust

520
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,360
the car as well because it will throw a

521
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,900
lot of fault codes that's one of the

522
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,090
things all the hacks if and if you are

523
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,190
able to do that in a newer vehicle with

524
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,920
a firewall that's something that you

525
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,100
know that is a reward about as well so

526
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,270
just steps and tricks

527
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,750
that's very cool Jay so we we're running

528
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,430
up up against time a bit here

529
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,850
unfortunately so we might have to if you

530
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,170
if you've only got one or two slides

531
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,000
left we can we can watch those where you

532
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,160
might have to jump to QA we've got a

533
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,010
good a few questions as well yeah this

534
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,720
is actually one of the fewer slides

535
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,970
already but

536
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:03,269
basically in the slide I've really demo

537
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:06,929
this one but here the references and

538
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:11,429
credits and just one last video that I'm

539
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:18,509
going to show so here's the can in the

540
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,029
middle in action so I'm using nano can

541
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:25,710
and can't act to fuzz the cluster so

542
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,690
this is the nano can and then they can

543
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,929
zap

544
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,310
banned their fuzzing the cluster so

545
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,840
that's one of the things that I play

546
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,020
with as well at home and because we're

547
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,820
running out of time I'm sorry for taking

548
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,040
a lot of time so I'm ready for it you

549
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,830
any so I should just stop the sharing

550
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,780
right

551
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,430
yeah it's that's fine if you wanna yeah

552
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,650
ng screen share we can jump in your Q&A

553
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,900
so personally I found that absolutely

554
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,130
fascinating I've got a pretty big

555
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,540
interested in cars myself

556
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,910
I'm more into modifications and and that

557
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,500
sort of stuff but the campus sort of

558
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,900
things is certainly fascinating one

559
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,900
thing I was wondering I indeed Dakar

560
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,430
hackers look at our non-oem equipment so

561
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,870
maybe alarms and entertainment systems

562
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,250
like you've got Android entertainment

563
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,590
systems about laughter market now and is

564
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,420
that is that the sort of stuff that the

565
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,780
car hackers look at also yes yes so

566
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,380
basically they also like try to figure

567
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,240
out how to attack the infotainment

568
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,180
system the Android head units so if you

569
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,920
could also find a vulnerability for

570
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,870
death that's something that it's reward

571
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,880
about it depends on the scope of the

572
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,530
program but usually it's in the scope

573
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,690
cool so there's obviously a lot of

574
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,760
manufacturers that are now using canvas

575
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,170
I guess they're all using it these days

576
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,120
but is there any major difference

577
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,640
between the manufacturers some are

578
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,750
better or worse than others that's

579
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,580
actually a tricky question or

580
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,490
interesting question is it's hard to

581
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,590
answer and without revealing too much

582
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,560
information but yeah generally us that's

583
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,960
the thing so I can't I can't really

584
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,890
speak based on the NDA that we have but

585
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:18,060
you know there are differences but they

586
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,140
use some standards like the can the Flex

587
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,560
ray and then other communication

588
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,010
protocol these again is one of the most

589
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,980
common protocols but there are other

590
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,340
protocols that it's actually present so

591
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,610
is the the can bus protocol unique to a

592
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,290
manufacturer is that based on a standard

593
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:44,039
that's open and available well for UD

594
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,789
there are standards for that but you

595
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:50,340
know it's unique for example take for

596
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,179
example for the instrument cluster of

597
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,909
mass da so the arbitration ID for

598
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,539
turning the speedometer is to 0-2 but

599
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:05,729
for PG 207 for example it's I think 50

600
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:10,168
56 B if I'm correct if I'm not I'm not

601
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:12,089
wrong but something like that so it

602
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:15,918
depends actually but in terms of UDS

603
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,559
like unified diagnostic services so they

604
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,989
have the same like getting the pin info

605
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:24,480
getting the vehicle and phone so that's

606
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,969
pretty much standard but you know

607
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:31,079
accessing some functionalities with

608
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,260
other end points so that's they have

609
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:40,619
different arbitration IDs so there's

610
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,359
obviously more autonomous vehicles and

611
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,829
and that sort of thing they in

612
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:46,109
development now is the attack surface of

613
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:48,030
internally on one of those vehicles much

614
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,829
larger than the standard internal

615
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:52,799
combustion like a regular v-dub gulf for

616
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,609
example i guess again can't talk about

617
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:59,520
it too much but in general yeah

618
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,869
Allah so basically if basically if a

619
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,690
pass telematics module if it has more

620
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,059
connections to the Internet the more

621
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:12,480
attack surfaces so

622
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,570
v2v or vehicle to vehicle communication

623
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:19,650
more attack surfaces yeah yeah

624
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,339
absolutely

625
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,170
alright I think that wraps it up for our

626
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,740
questions now but I think the I think it

627
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,270
might be one or two we didn't get to but

628
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,070
if you could drop into the to the

629
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,510
discord after this and and maybe ask

630
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,160
answer some questions in there that

631
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,020
would that would be very much

632
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,859
appreciated

633
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:42,329
yeah anyway I would just like to give a

634
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:44,250
warning so I'm not an automotive

635
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,099
security expert so I just have like

636
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:48,960
knowledge because of the things that I

637
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,270
learned from mug batches from going to

638
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,369
DEFCON car hacking village and learning

639
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:56,670
this stuff so if I can't answer those

640
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,329
questions

641
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:01,040
all in all I'm sorry I apologize yeah

642
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,630
it's no problem at all it's it's a it's

643
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,490
a fascinating area it's definitely gonna

644
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,500
be an area that we need we need people

645
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,210
looking into cars by looking into the

646
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,130
cars they've got and maybe picking up an

647
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,570
instrument cluster on eBay and and

648
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,119
playing around with it I'll certainly

649
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,400
find those issues yeah so for me that's

650
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,640
one of the best actually thing if you

651
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,069
want an actual hard hardware it's good

652
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:24,420
to start with instruments lessons like

653
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,970
how to figure out and how to turn turn

654
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,810
off the in the engine light so something

655
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,319
like that

656
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:33,480
turn on the speedometer it's one of the

657
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,599
most basic thing that you can do and

658
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,140
then try some simulators as well like

659
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,589
for example the online I mean the

660
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:44,790
virtual instrument cluster by Craig

661
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,440
Smith the UDS server which is the one

662
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,540
that I was running a while ago so it's a

663
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,480
good thing that you get a grasp of the

664
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,400
basics of core aking and canvas

665
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:13,070
