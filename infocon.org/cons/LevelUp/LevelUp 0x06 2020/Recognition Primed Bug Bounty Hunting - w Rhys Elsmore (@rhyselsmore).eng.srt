00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:10,880
[Music]

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,299
so next up we're cutting to a really

3
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,010
technical talk which i think is also

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,720
we've had such a great balance in this

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,300
entry bit of all the soft skills and all

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,949
the stuff that you have to know that's

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,890
really important we're now going to also

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,510
have resource mark for technical talk

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,789
Rhys is someone I think it's like a real

10
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,410
unsung hero in the bug bounty community

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,530
those that know him just get blown away

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,880
those that triage these reports we get

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,559
crazy impostor syndrome every time I've

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,710
seen Rhys hack an item it's been patched

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,510
hack it again it's been patched and then

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,910
find zero day in their build system to

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,100
hack it a third time and that kind of

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,870
tenacity and digging deep is something

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,960
that I I just he's known for he does a

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,969
great job I'm really excited for him and

21
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,480
for this talk and take it away Rhys well

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,039
I mean that was a that was a really good

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,480
intro so hopefully I can live up to the

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,870
hype how y'all doing I'm gonna get

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,990
straight into sharing the slides so once

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:14,040
I can will get how to zoom all right

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,750
I'll just get a quick check any ones

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,390
everyone see the slides yep solid also

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,360
let's go this is recognition probe bug

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,670
bounty hunting the first thing I'm gonna

31
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,950
cover is that there are some pictures of

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,110
fires and natural disasters in here I'll

33
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,659
try and call them out as I go but yeah

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,909
just a heads up now this changed a

35
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,979
little bit right the format of the talk

36
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,530
changed it now includes 13 P ones a

37
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,970
psychology lesson in a last minute

38
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,159
change first of all I want to give a

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,500
huge shout out to the organizers butter

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,720
up and all the amazing speakers I've

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,579
seen so far I got up super early for

42
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,530
this so let's start with an introduction

43
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,740
first of all I have a lot of duplicates

44
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,450
my queue is full of them I find them a

45
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,729
lot this is my first bug I have a

46
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:57,899
phantom bug head it's like five years

47
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,649
ago I got paid zero dollars in one point

48
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:02,880
recently I'm going to water 20 dollars

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,890
for a bounty which you know let me go

50
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,210
and buy a burger that was pretty cool

51
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,520
and for the month of October 2019 I

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,598
didn't find any bugs

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,599
I had these competing priorities right

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,340
lots of family stuff

55
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,470
and you know just lost motivation and

56
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,700
kind of that burnout that everyone talks

57
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,620
about now the inspiration of this talk

58
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,510
star in San Francisco at the end of

59
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,970
February I was in a lift with Casey

60
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,970
joining us and we just appeared on Fox

61
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,940
TV for a live interview and basically we

62
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,319
have talked about the Arlo bug - that

63
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,790
would happen several days earlier and

64
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,049
you know talking about some of the crazy

65
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,209
bugs that found and largely that's what

66
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:36,980
I'm going to cover crazy bugs and I

67
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,170
can't remember the exact words I used

68
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,030
then it went along the lines of oh my

69
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,799
strategy is I just combined some of the

70
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,269
helpful parts of firefighting with

71
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,280
hacking so let's take a bit of a left

72
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,590
turn this is Mary salt more on Twitter

73
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,860
I've been on bike route since about

74
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,280
2015-2016 I've got three hammers for a

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,400
buck red for taking bug measures most a

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,530
legal hacker Awards I worked for a big

77
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,299
blue cloud doing security architecture

78
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:04,549
I've got to Australian Shepherds and I'm

79
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,950
into CrossFit running in jujitsu now

80
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,390
these are the dogs if you hear them bark

81
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,610
it's going to sound really terrible but

82
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,549
yeah I apologize they just waking up now

83
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:14,989
I've also got this really weird side

84
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,600
hustle right I'm a firefighter with fire

85
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,160
mirskiy New South Wales which is our

86
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,720
state's paid professional fire service

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,780
we attend fires motor vehicle accidents

88
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,819
rescue incidents medical emergencies and

89
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,819
I've also been a stint as a paramedic

90
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:31,130
ignore the crazy photo and when I was 18

91
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,230
I was in a volunteer Rescue Service now

92
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,299
I'm not lying when I say that I use what

93
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,530
I've learned in these jumpers to improve

94
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,970
my hacking and when I tell people this

95
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,430
directions normally like fascinating you

96
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,260
know there's questions and then you see

97
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,760
the COG starter turns people try and

98
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,230
correlate knocking down a door or

99
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,120
looking at every tool hacking into a

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,150
system and then they hear some Epiphany

101
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,010
yeah but what if and they say well I

102
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,900
thought is try to pet fires you hack is

103
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,209
always trying to start fires and you

104
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,639
know that's sort of true as bug bounty

105
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,900
hunters we're trying to do it for good

106
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,459
not evil you know make the internet a

107
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,220
safer place to be and realistically we

108
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,540
do have a lot of Florida fires to put

109
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:05,780
out

110
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,010
they're just hidden and we don't know

111
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,049
where they are yet so I'm gonna try

112
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,250
again and come at this from a different

113
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:10,730
angle

114
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,269
ah first responders follow this really

115
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,478
old model pretty much unconsciously and

116
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,349
this is what I'm going to be basing the

117
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,450
talk about around don't worry about

118
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,130
reading this now I'll pop up plenty more

119
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,719
times and we'll analyze it bit by bit

120
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:26,090
basically by having this model hammered

121
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,200
into me while engaging

122
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,780
emergency services work unconsciously

123
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,520
applied it to other parts of my life and

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,950
that's include bug bounty hunting as I'm

125
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,360
going to cover you don't need to work in

126
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,500
these jobs to get better at navigating

127
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,260
this process because really packing is

128
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,700
walking into an unfamiliar situation

129
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,830
getting familiar with it and developing

130
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,720
a course of action over time you get

131
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,070
more experience more tools at your

132
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,020
disposal more knowledge and more options

133
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,510
and if you're lucky a methodology and I

134
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,490
found this is the case I'll start with

135
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,180
an example

136
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,610
so my bug through is going to take my

137
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,840
bug walk through is going to take this

138
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,720
format so we have a user right and they

139
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,400
can send some JavaScript up and it gets

140
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,160
built by our target that JavaScript it's

141
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,900
got packages in it so the build service

142
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,280
reaches out and grabs those packages

143
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,920
makes a component function and then the

144
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,450
targets cloud provider you know their

145
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,280
their value proposition their service

146
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,590
it causes compiled function with events

147
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,560
and API keys now me as the bad guy I

148
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,660
craft an entire package and brood on NPM

149
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,400
which was absolutely allowed

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,620
I then set my own JavaScript up to this

151
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,110
build service which went along and it

152
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,730
grabbed my malicious package and for

153
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,590
some reason this temporary file appeared

154
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,110
across all the Landers now it got a

155
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,390
little bit spicy when the user open it

156
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,100
up that corner did their second build

157
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,440
for some reason this temporary file was

158
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,570
grabbed JavaScript was executed and I

159
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,400
was able to steal API keys and catch

160
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,560
events and malware into these genuine

161
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,290
builds this was a vulnerability I found

162
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,730
at the end of last year and you know

163
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,400
this relied on this file is temporary

164
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,960
for our being certain place to set off

165
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,450
this whole big chain of events and

166
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,100
naturally p1 we top rewards it was it's

167
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,900
a really fun bug to work on and an

168
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,170
absolute pain in the butt to replicate

169
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,600
it also got me a report to the young

170
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,790
file package manager which was pretty

171
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,020
cool you know getting to work with those

172
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,820
folks and explained this big long walk

173
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,160
through powers able to implant a file in

174
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,230
a certain spot now they'll really cool

175
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,850
or deal with prompt service and

176
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,460
professional manner so there's a lot to

177
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,630
consider in this bug right there's at

178
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,250
least five points here and a whole lot

179
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,420
of trial and error

180
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,430
remember that bug I showed you at Star I

181
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,530
got one point zero dollars yeah it's a

182
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,570
little bit different this time all

183
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,000
that's different is time experience and

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,440
you know I've learned things along the

185
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,910
way to chain these things together and

186
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,820
maximize impact and here's the secret

187
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,890
there wasn't any magic to that p1 it was

188
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,180
just a result of this accumulate

189
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,740
knowledge and knowing what to do after a

190
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,610
whole bunch of trial and error and

191
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,470
getting better at recognizing these use

192
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,500
scenarios and information gathering

193
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,580
something I had a bit of unconscious

194
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,919
training in so for the next 45 minutes

195
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,419
or so I'm going to step through the

196
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,880
parts called out in red as they've been

197
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,430
the most helpful to me when hunting bugs

198
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,930
I'm also going to include some really

199
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,610
cool fun bugs I think we've got about 12

200
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,740
more peat ones to go through and I'm

201
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,850
going to give examples of where I've

202
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,530
taken inspiration from the training and

203
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,449
experiences of firefighting to move the

204
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:11,060
needle on my hacking so here's the

205
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,530
layout right I'm going to start with a

206
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,729
history of the model I'm going to make

207
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:14,930
onto why I make more time for

208
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,270
observation analysis looking researching

209
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,340
and generally improving my situational

210
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,960
awareness I'm going to detail my

211
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,699
playbook for how I pivot when I'm stuck

212
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,740
or don't know where to go next and then

213
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,330
gonna go into my short ambitious goals

214
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,220
and how I know I'm getting them met

215
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,169
finally taking action what it means to

216
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,729
move from a standard bug into something

217
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:33,110
that stands out and reduces uncertainty

218
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,830
I'm gonna finish on finish off with

219
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,060
basically some war stories tips and

220
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,410
tricks and you know how I found

221
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,539
emergency service worked beneficial to

222
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:46,130
hacking so let's get started with the

223
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,729
model this is the same slide as before

224
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,710
once again it's the recognition prime

225
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,050
model this is pretty much accepted as a

226
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,789
playbook to decisions their emergency

227
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,070
service workers make there's variations

228
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,260
of this that are taught however this is

229
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,970
considered some of the original research

230
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,130
and it was originally commissioned by

231
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,900
the military as you can see this this

232
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,060
guy Gary Cole enemies cohort a client

233
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,610
associates they went from producers

234
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,710
report for the military now we've got a

235
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,080
date of 1990 on there there's actually

236
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,909
been a huge amount of research into how

237
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:18,560
people make decisions and he started in

238
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,610
about 1985

239
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,520
now climb ease of use a psychologist and

240
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,590
him and his cohort they began to

241
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,000
research how decisions were made by

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,849
these expert decision-makers under

243
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,729
certain circumstances now this photo is

244
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:33,260
not Gary Klein I just thought it was

245
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,760
pretty cool to imagine this experiment

246
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,419
being done with test tubes and beakers

247
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,370
now what they realized is when these

248
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,899
decisions were being made by these

249
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,540
expert decision makers there wasn't this

250
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,310
list of options that was being compared

251
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,959
right they weren't even comparing two

252
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,329
options and it struck the researchers as

253
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,740
odd because it was so early in the

254
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,630
project so naturally they ended up

255
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,870
revising the whole project

256
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,160
and eventually came up with a model of

257
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,620
how people actually make decisions but

258
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,300
they weren't looking at any decision

259
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,820
makers in particular they actually had a

260
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,050
very small focus group and they were

261
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,880
emergency service workers health care

262
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,370
workers defense forces politicians any

263
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,050
job where critical decisions have to be

264
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,880
made in a hurry and consideration given

265
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,630
to future decisions now this researcher

266
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,310
focused on these folks because they tend

267
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,660
to have a lot of practice making

268
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,790
decisions that fall into a certain

269
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,100
category now I want to address the elf

270
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,810
in the room first I made up the words

271
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,400
temporal criticality for this slide

272
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,190
because having time sensitive in there

273
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,110
didn't fit with the the descriptors that

274
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,730
I used elsewhere I was just bugging me a

275
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,600
bit so I made up some fancy word now

276
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,740
let's talk about the intersection these

277
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,810
three criteria basically these

278
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,480
researchers modeled and what they

279
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,490
essentially found is these so-called

280
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,930
expert decision-makers that they chose

281
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,330
to leave fall back to one of three parts

282
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,450
to take and it's pretty much applied to

283
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,800
most decision-making in general

284
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,470
basically a brain is constantly picking

285
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,150
one of three playbooks to get started

286
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,279
with when we have to act oh sorry my

287
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,230
keynote just went a bit weird I'm just

288
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,400
going to go back a slide and then

289
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,339
forward so basically our brain is

290
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:09,480
constantly picking one of three

291
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,800
playbooks to get started with when we

292
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,800
have to act now variation one is the

293
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,450
run-of-the-mill situation you know

294
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,040
something it's typical something that

295
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,839
you have to do every day they're

296
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,820
hardwired scenarios with knowing goals

297
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,230
priorities and steps where your brain

298
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,450
pretty much saw short circuits without

299
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,730
you thinking about it you know imagine

300
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,560
walking to your car you put your car

301
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,180
keys you unlock it you open the door you

302
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,709
get in was that a decision you had to

303
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,740
make no it was pretty much hardwired so

304
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,200
what if you encounter a situation that

305
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,240
you haven't seen before where you don't

306
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,279
know what's going on that's pretty much

307
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,040
variation to this is where the

308
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,540
decision-maker has to diagnose the

309
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,160
situation in order to develop the course

310
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,470
of action it takes the form of the

311
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,480
question mark then I'm going to do

312
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,130
something but they have to work out that

313
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,870
question mark first because well that

314
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,100
prevents complications and

315
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,959
misinformation and they know what they

316
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,000
actually have to do basically we're

317
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,110
trying to work out what the hell is

318
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,030
going on so that we can make a response

319
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,420
and at least variation three and this is

320
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,850
the big one the decision-maker has

321
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,459
some idea of the situation if they don't

322
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:12,720
really know what course of action to

323
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,120
take and this is where the recognition

324
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,459
based model comes in it turns out that

325
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,870
there is a process that is followed

326
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,980
depending on your experience with

327
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,600
decision-making you film it with

328
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,699
familiarity with this over the situation

329
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:26,100
your list of possible actions and the

330
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,630
factors influencing the solution now

331
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,009
this is the process again we're going to

332
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:34,290
see it a lot-- climb and he's cut out

333
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,480
and his cohort found and this is a

334
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,490
really rough decision model right the

335
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,660
people typically follow this when

336
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,819
they're not sure the steps to take

337
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,259
however the outcome of you following

338
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:45,120
this process is entirely different

339
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,490
depending on a bunch of factors mostly

340
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,500
people in typical safe environments

341
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,300
don't tend to encounter situations when

342
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,649
they're where they're out of their depth

343
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,019
and need to be sure of the next steps

344
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,029
now where they require an immediate

345
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,730
action and they're not sure what to do

346
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,350
when they do encounter these scenarios a

347
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,790
whole lot of factors come into play

348
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,160
you know what the scenario is the

349
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,509
abilities of the individual how they

350
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:08,970
react the tools at the disposal however

351
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,440
what client found was that there's a

352
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,180
certain environment that fostered the

353
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,680
development a unique ability was

354
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,910
following this chart of a stress

355
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,699
pressure and uncertainty and it's folks

356
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:19,560
who work in jobs like these pretty much

357
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,540
it's just muscle memory you're really

358
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,040
good at typing because you try for a job

359
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,139
you know you run a lot so you get good

360
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:25,680
at running

361
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,689
turns out the B's folk are really good

362
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,339
at operating in high stress environments

363
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,199
that require good problem solving and

364
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:32,970
analytical skills you know while still

365
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,560
maintaining the composure and deciding

366
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,470
on a course of action now that doesn't

367
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,000
mean they're great at everything if you

368
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,050
were to put me in a fencing competition

369
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,139
I'd be pretty useless I'm just good at

370
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,639
finding this decision model and working

371
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,230
my way through things and trying to

372
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,750
solve a big problem and bugs are the

373
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,389
absolute perfect problem now this was

374
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:53,100
one from about two weeks ago right I

375
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,319
noticed that the site used Optimizely

376
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:56,850
everywhere you don't need to know what

377
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,769
Optimizely was but I saw that keyword

378
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:01,250
thought okay this might be a path

379
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,899
immediately I thought Optimizely allows

380
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,519
you believe that custom JavaScript as

381
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,529
experiments okay cool

382
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,480
the target had a number of public github

383
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,880
repositories my brain immediately went

384
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,399
to AI grecque repository spoke basically

385
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,610
API token format I found a token

386
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,939
committed in a branch from way back a

387
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:22,570
validated the token still worked

388
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,730
and essentially I wrote instructions for

389
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,740
how to perform sort of XSS across every

390
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,330
single web property from the target

391
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,790
using this token basically XSS

392
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,550
everywhere they run it and once again p1

393
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,760
heavily redacted but it ended up being a

394
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,560
really interesting one to retrospect on

395
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,300
right because I've been trying to refine

396
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,010
this process and working where I am

397
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,560
actually operating the way am and atami

398
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,700
that this bug instead inside this

399
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,320
intersection for acquired knowledge for

400
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,150
what process and this situational

401
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,830
awareness I had to know what Optimizely

402
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,720
was I had to know what it was capable of

403
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,430
I just know that these secrets of here

404
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,170
on github and I had to know how to tell

405
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,330
the story that this was just more than a

406
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,150
leaked credential this wasn't trial and

407
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,600
error

408
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,190
this was application of accumulated

409
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,780
knowledge learned from past experience

410
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,970
now without some sort of framework to

411
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,500
what I was doing I didn't think I would

412
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,260
have ever found it and generally that

413
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,480
framework builds is skilled from small

414
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,250
brain to exploding brain right mentioned

415
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,400
trial and error because that's typically

416
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,690
that's that's where someone unfamiliar

417
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,550
with in the process or what the process

418
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,040
relates to typically starts as time

419
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,330
progresses they learn from their

420
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,250
mistakes recount previous experiences

421
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,720
keep doing the same thing over and over

422
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,120
until they finally rich bring a genius

423
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,410
brain level where they feel comfortable

424
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,230
to navigate unknown scenarios pretty

425
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,490
much these for these people would be

426
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,410
endorsed on LinkedIn for this set of

427
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,110
skills right all these skills for what

428
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,390
expert decision-makers end up with so

429
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,520
let's do a quick recap people typically

430
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,400
resort to one of three paths our past

431
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,260
experience intuition cues bias

432
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,330
requirements if you're hungry everything

433
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,130
influences a course of action and

434
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,580
decision making improvement means moving

435
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,530
from having to diagnosed situations into

436
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,390
these programmed responses and better

437
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,200
problem solving skills you can get

438
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,940
better at diagnosing situations and

439
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,190
making decisions it's just the truth

440
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,540
that now I want to move on to what the

441
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,940
model calls experiencing the situation

442
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,100
it's at the top and it's up there for a

443
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,410
very good reason now for bunting

444
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,300
bounty-hunting this might mean an entire

445
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,950
target or just the area that you're

446
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,630
testing at the moment it doesn't have to

447
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,190
be every decision you make it doesn't

448
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,140
have to be a single decision you know

449
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,990
you use it as you see fit but before I

450
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,910
move on I want to take back walk back to

451
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,170
the image of me when I first done with

452
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,529
bounties you know that zero

453
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:39,079
Dola one point bounty this is me and

454
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,459
what I like to call one of my random

455
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:42,980
walks uh I wouldn't have a plan

456
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,319
I would aimlessly walk around trying to

457
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,420
find mugs and I do random tests and

458
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,790
obviously this wasn't optimal and led to

459
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,189
a lot of repeat testing and wasted time

460
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:54,829
and missed opportunities basically my

461
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,230
plan was that I had no plan and I was

462
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,779
hoping to get lucky and it took a lot of

463
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:01,730
frustration trial and error for me to

464
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,230
break this pattern and move into

465
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,620
experiencing the situation now I want to

466
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,029
give an example of how we work as

467
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:10,430
firefighters this will set the scene for

468
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,199
the moment pretend that those

469
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:14,180
firefighters over there aren't there and

470
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,579
we've just turned up the moment we turn

471
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:18,769
up the officer-in-charge will do one one

472
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,209
thing first they'll walk around the

473
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:22,670
scene and determine what's going on you

474
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,839
know for something like this they might

475
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,189
look up there and say well the fire is

476
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,420
close to a wooden roof that's pretty

477
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:26,959
dangerous

478
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,309
they might say that trees lean over

479
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:29,600
firefighters that's pretty dangerous

480
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,339
they might look at the smoke and stay

481
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,499
with flies early stages they might say

482
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,029
well brick that keeps heat in and it's

483
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,519
at a higher risk of structural collapse

484
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,019
and they might season you know what

485
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,370
might be a water tank or something over

486
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,379
here basically this is something that's

487
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,120
common across emergency services and

488
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,699
it's called 360 size up you know now

489
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:50,029
service and this has a few key points

490
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,490
that are this has a few really good

491
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,709
benefits first of all it builds

492
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,420
situational awareness you know you can

493
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,610
see what's going on you stop look and

494
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,189
listen you don't understand the context

495
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:02,809
so you can see what the circumstances

496
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:04,699
are behind the thing that's happening

497
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:07,429
you get to identify key and critical

498
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:09,260
factors so you know what you need to

499
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,209
watch out for and what you might need in

500
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,730
the future you get to capture change you

501
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,898
know you look at something and you said

502
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:16,398
well it's changing a little bit I might

503
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:18,829
need to consider that and finally you

504
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,720
get to plan ahead you say well that's

505
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,010
something I should worry about down the

506
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,490
track

507
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,130
now I've appropriated this and I use it

508
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,510
for the starting point for all new

509
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,059
target sites and feature now I'll give

510
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:34,220
you an example so this is me and instead

511
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,600
of jumping straight in and hacking with

512
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,289
burb I went and did my 360 and did a

513
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:40,520
basically a map of the target and I'll

514
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,950
go into what those maps look like I

515
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,940
discovered a paid feature over here

516
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,490
which was basically limiting life some

517
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,860
features for premium customers one of

518
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,150
those was data export

519
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,760
now I thought to myself well that seems

520
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,440
like a vector where I might be able get

521
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,840
something juicy so I paid the fee and I

522
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,570
got access to data export and with a

523
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,220
little bit of feeling I was able to turn

524
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,470
that into an SSR F which reached out to

525
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,320
Google cloud and got their credentials

526
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,840
essentially gave me RCA now this was

527
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,270
another bug that was paid out and I love

528
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,590
Transco in the air I was trying to

529
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,090
reproduce this but can't seem to find

530
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,610
the blank in my account so I paid for it

531
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,270
boring my account for a moment now

532
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,460
this 360 that I did this target size up

533
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,320
it's really important because a lot of

534
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,250
the time when we're hunting bounties

535
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,770
we're walking around this fog of war you

536
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,050
know you've got to miss kiti details you

537
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,429
gonna get testable areas and you're

538
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:32,990
gonna like this the key situational

539
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,670
awareness I wouldn't have known about

540
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,780
this paid feature and wondered tested it

541
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,890
unless like going out looking for it

542
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,720
unless I know well these the areas that

543
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,710
I need to cover so when I'm looking at a

544
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,800
target I do the target size up I start

545
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,240
and I look at the frameworks languages

546
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,710
and technologies it can get a really

547
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,600
rough idea of how this thing's built I

548
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,460
go through and make a list of hidden

549
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,929
features you know things that are paid

550
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:58,520
things that are unlocked via doing

551
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,940
something else made of features I

552
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,010
identify testing areas so areas which

553
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,780
might have some know things I might want

554
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,730
to test and then make a list of the

555
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,679
things I need to know about if they use

556
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,420
Google I might want to improve my skills

557
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,940
with Google and then finally I pick out

558
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,590
some low-hanging fruit or some things

559
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,410
that might be quick and easy wins and

560
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,059
what this ends up being is basically a

561
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,670
mind map I start at the top I pick the

562
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,260
target I break down bits of

563
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,300
infrastructure and I go down as low as I

564
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,830
want to putting questions and comments

565
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,380
as I go I'm not doing it interesting I'm

566
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,850
capturing all the context I need so I

567
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,200
can work out how I'm going to approach

568
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,210
the problem nothing's stuck on this boat

569
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,950
chain for three hours and losing some

570
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,720
important key detail I picked up earlier

571
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,190
because I got focused on the wrong thing

572
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,070
I'm keeping my context somewhere this

573
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,570
gives me something I can come back to

574
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,320
later on

575
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,390
I can't indicate for this process enough

576
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,400
I'll give you another example so if it

577
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,590
ends with my 360 I find that there's

578
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,440
three steps that if I follow it unlocks

579
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,050
this data import feature like you know

580
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,340
really obscure steps you have to go

581
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,929
through and set up a custom domain and

582
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:01,190
go over here and register your business

583
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,559
but it unlocks data Explorer and

584
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,330
wasn't mentioned in any many manuals

585
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,200
that seemed to be this really new

586
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,200
feature and basically I'll start data

587
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,309
important so you could throw CSV TSP or

588
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,049
XML in there turns out it was vulnerable

589
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:19,460
to xx e SS RF AWS credentials I see here

590
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,399
yet another p1 now without this

591
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,169
understanding this target specific setup

592
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:25,909
and the nuance of how they operate I

593
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:27,919
will probably gotten stuck somewhere

594
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,139
else or totally miss this feature exists

595
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:33,590
so I find a massive value in stopping

596
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,929
observing and obtaining an awareness of

597
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:40,429
what's going on now let's do a recap

598
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:42,559
doing a complete sighs over the

599
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,299
situation will help you determine the

600
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,419
next steps it allows you to capture key

601
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,460
T details and map out a target and

602
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,230
identify capabilities and knowledge that

603
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,490
you may need it is absolutely okay to

604
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,440
guess if something isn't clear this is

605
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,909
an important skill to practice and it

606
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:01,220
helps you move along if I come across a

607
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,659
target I can't work out where they post

608
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:04,309
it and it's gonna say well it's probably

609
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:06,409
Amazon or Google or somewhere else but

610
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,539
I'll have to find out later on where

611
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,009
that is but for now let's just assume

612
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,169
they're in the cloud anything else I

613
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,809
find out later on may change that and

614
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,249
finally no matter what I do I start

615
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:18,350
developing a rough plan but I don't

616
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,909
begin any testing just yet

617
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,919
I don't do that until I've got a full

618
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,720
plate in place I know what I'm looking

619
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,519
at I know roughly what I'm going to do I

620
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:31,009
know where I'm gonna start now our bread

621
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:32,899
and butter is emergency services workers

622
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:36,909
is unfamiliar situations and they fall

623
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:40,309
just under our chief experienced this

624
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:42,799
situation in a changing context you turn

625
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,169
up you have a look around you taking

626
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:47,090
everything that's going on and then you

627
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,769
work out is this something that I can

628
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:51,409
deal with that's familiar do I have all

629
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:54,289
the information I need and a lot of the

630
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:56,029
times you're walking in there and saying

631
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:58,970
I have no memory of this place it might

632
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,759
you know for bug bounty hunting it might

633
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,769
be a new program new framework new

634
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:05,690
target you air a message you stack trace

635
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,639
your cloud provider it doesn't matter

636
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,950
because really the work that we do is

637
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,330
about keeping track of and moving

638
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,730
changing target and the technology that

639
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,169
we deal with is wide and varied you

640
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,659
can't be expected to know it all

641
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:19,059
you will encounter these unknowns so

642
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:20,769
being able to actually deal with these

643
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:22,629
unfamiliar situations and try and wiggle

644
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:26,200
way out of them is super important this

645
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,489
is all about walking into an unknown

646
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:29,470
situation gathering details and being

647
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,989
comfortable to develop the plan now the

648
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:33,999
next few slides do cover a natural

649
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:37,419
disaster in Sydney so I'm going to call

650
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:39,869
them out via images of fire and such so

651
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:43,450
this was our sampler pretty much this

652
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,609
was an outlier in situations that we

653
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:48,609
deal with this was unprecedented in

654
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:49,989
Australia pretty much the biggest bush

655
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:52,059
fires that we've ever had and this

656
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:54,129
never-before-seen mobilization of tens

657
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,749
of thousands of firefighters and this

658
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,519
fire behavior that wasn't seen before

659
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,369
pretty much a new unfamiliar situation

660
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:03,159
and I wanted to call out in particular

661
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:05,229
one particular incident that occurred

662
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:08,559
during this multi month sort of event

663
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,929
now this is the sleepy village of

664
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:12,820
building which is up in the mountains of

665
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,379
but against Sydney and it's got

666
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:15,999
beautiful birdcalls orchards

667
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:17,739
Torre's tranquil tremble mountain

668
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:19,659
lifestyle and you know it's an

669
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:21,999
absolutely beautiful place and this is

670
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:24,580
building up building on a good day now

671
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,499
it's a really confronting image but this

672
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:30,519
was built in in mid-2000 19 pretty much

673
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,499
fire front was moving through and

674
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:35,710
nothing was going to stop it now as you

675
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,419
can imagine there's fires all over the

676
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:39,849
state resources were super stretched so

677
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:41,259
they responded trucks from the centre of

678
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,669
Sydney to come help in this situation

679
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:45,789
and really this isn't down the road you

680
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,619
have the City of Sydney here you have

681
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:49,450
built up here that works out to be about

682
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,989
90 kilometers or 55 miles now one of the

683
00:23:52,989 --> 00:23:55,330
firefighters a day from the City of

684
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,669
Sydney station was wearing a go let's

685
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,859
have some really valuable lessons now I

686
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:01,299
want to call out this part of footage

687
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,429
right there at the edge of Sydney here

688
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:04,779
just a got to go up into the mountains

689
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,970
probably about 40 kilometres from where

690
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,379
they ended up now this is a pump they

691
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:13,029
get there they lay out a whole bunch of

692
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:14,289
hose so these are the city firefighters

693
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,109
so they had a whole bunch of hose and

694
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:19,509
they get to work now that water lasted

695
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:21,039
about seven eight minutes those hoses

696
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,229
use a blower water so they empty bed

697
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:24,909
truck really quickly trying to defend a

698
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:26,529
house and then eventually have to say

699
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,629
well we need more water and the next

700
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:30,890
shot is where sort of clicks they got

701
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,390
we're looking for water and then here

702
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,250
I'm asked a local hate you know with

703
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,650
hydrants are up here and this is a

704
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,120
mountain talent right everyone drinks

705
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,860
rainwater from tanks running water isn't

706
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,110
a thing you had these city slickers in

707
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,299
an unknown situation and really pick up

708
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,340
the answer that was to be expected the

709
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,200
person on the video says about 50 or 60

710
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,570
K it turns out to be about 40 but that's

711
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,929
a still a really long way to go so this

712
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:55,549
was an unfamiliar situation where things

713
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:57,440
weren't expected well were what they

714
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,910
expected now it turns out that they had

715
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,440
to drastically change their tactics

716
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,690
moving forward initially they were also

717
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,370
lacking this information that conserving

718
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,020
water might be a good idea I'm

719
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,210
absolutely not faulting them on it it's

720
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,070
an unprecedented scenario teachable

721
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,840
moment and something like they won't

722
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,780
forget and it's the nature of unknown

723
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,640
but this is the nature of emergency

724
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,799
services right we go to or unknown fluid

725
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,120
situations each with their own

726
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,820
peculiarities and really it's a bit like

727
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,270
bug hunting and what they learn there's

728
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,820
this quote that is absolutely never miss

729
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,830
attributed that sums about really well I

730
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,510
actually went out looking for how this

731
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,250
quote was Mossad tributed and people

732
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,200
seem to claim it as their own is this

733
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,790
cheesy line and I think it's really

734
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,200
hilarious if people go and put their own

735
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,480
name under it and it sort of holds some

736
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,190
weight right we get better by doing by

737
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,540
experiencing by learning from our

738
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,640
mistakes and by very assessing it's one

739
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,780
thing to be taught in a classroom but

740
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,070
it's another thing to get out there and

741
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,350
get your hands dirty and this is what

742
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,570
exactly this is what I mean when I say

743
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,059
you get stuck basically earnest in a

744
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,260
situation where you know the rough

745
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,270
basics but you're not sure the exact

746
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,790
specifics to move forward so basically

747
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,440
being able to say I think I'm going to

748
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,480
try this and moving that direction is a

749
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,610
really valuable skill to have now I'm

750
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,929
going to call out a few least skills

751
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:10,640
here and I'm going to put under the

752
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,390
heading of reassessing situations these

753
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,070
are just some methods that you know I've

754
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,660
used when finding certain bugs and

755
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,700
they've worked out to be really really

756
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,370
useful now the first thing I want to

757
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,440
call that is collaboration if you want

758
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,880
to see something absolutely oh no wait

759
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,490
you can't see my camera my phone's going

760
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,720
off for a fire call I'm not gonna

761
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,340
believe this stream and go take it so

762
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:31,970
don't worry

763
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,580
um first of all I want to call our

764
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,230
collaboration right when you need to

765
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,760
assess the situation or get some more

766
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,380
information there's nothing better than

767
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,660
collaboration might be another hacker an

768
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,670
engineer or just the rubber duck on

769
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,450
it definitely holds some weight before I

770
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,070
start with this bug walkthrough I want

771
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,720
to stress that this was a program that

772
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,030
had a clearly communicated flag and they

773
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,290
were expecting people to walk through

774
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,050
multiple layers I didn't go rushing in

775
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,280
without checking that things were okay

776
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,710
first so it starts out with our flag

777
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,330
over here basically there are offering

778
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,250
up some dollar II dues if we could get

779
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,910
into this s3 bucket now I began by doing

780
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,370
my 360 and getting a really good idea of

781
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,540
the target and based on this 360 I'd

782
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,120
encountered a URL with another URL in it

783
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,710
and it was a pretty clear and obvious s

784
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,220
srf now what this gave me was access to

785
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,520
AWS it access to kubernetes and access

786
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,100
to docker but unfortunately it was

787
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,520
read-only and unfortunately the AWS that

788
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,400
actually we wanted was over here now I

789
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,290
probably spent a good day and a half

790
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,240
hammering this thing trying all these

791
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,010
different options and eventually came up

792
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,620
with something that's stuck but it would

793
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,320
impact prod it might take down some

794
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,210
servers it might take down the targets

795
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,220
infrastructure it might do it in prod

796
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,380
and really I didn't know if I get the

797
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,030
expected outcome of it out of it

798
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,450
so I didn't do that I went to my Rob

799
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,190
Doug which was another hacker and I said

800
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,890
hey I'm stuck and pretty much they said

801
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,960
did you try dead and one no I didn't

802
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,070
think of that that's an absolutely

803
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,510
fantastic idea so I went back to dev

804
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,390
down the same SS RAF got access to their

805
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,130
AWS account now it turns out I had a

806
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,720
role where I could jump into this AWS

807
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,730
account it turns out that rolling your

808
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,050
abs three bucket yet another p1 got the

809
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,330
flag pretty happy paint collaboration

810
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,760
bonuses you know it all went down well

811
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,530
and I can't speak highly enough of

812
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,230
collaboration by crowds built for it you

813
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,700
can add other people to bugs you can pay

814
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,070
a percentage and you know really we do

815
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,290
go further together there's absolutely

816
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,760
no harm in asking someone else for an

817
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,080
opinion or to listen to your issue

818
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,060
sometimes verbalizing it allows you move

819
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,860
past the problem cycle or obtain a new

820
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,290
perspective we use it enormous leal in

821
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,510
putting together a plan there's no harm

822
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,840
in asking hey anyone else have any ideas

823
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,070
so next up I want to call that

824
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,880
documentation

825
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,700
targets with great documentation eirick

826
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,960
goldmine for ideas and

827
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,850
making misuse certain findings or pivot

828
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,580
when you get stuck yet another

829
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,020
walkthrough I don't know how many P once

830
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,130
we're up to so far once again it starts

831
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,809
with the 360 I goes from make a complete

832
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:10,309
map of what I'm going to look for and

833
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:13,399
this API stood out to me because it had

834
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:15,529
its endpoint which was yet worth two

835
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:18,440
miles and really I'd never seen that

836
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,659
advertised somewhere before I'm just

837
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:25,730
gonna take a sip of water I've never

838
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,350
seen the ability to get a wolf denial

839
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,390
spire an API before I knew you could get

840
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,600
authorizations but never denials so

841
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,460
inquisitive me I went out and I denied

842
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,440
an application I didn't home and for

843
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,799
some reason the payload changed and for

844
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,870
some reason included this client ID in

845
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,480
secret well that's not supposed to

846
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,940
happen now this happens on mobile apps

847
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,559
sometimes and you know might be paid out

848
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,330
as a Petri or a p2 depending on what you

849
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,880
can do but most of the time it's either

850
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,760
p2 p3 or it requires some sort of user

851
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,510
interaction to work with so I decided to

852
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,549
sit down and read the developer Docs you

853
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,140
know get a good idea of how that all the

854
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,669
system works and what I might be able to

855
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:05,240
do with this

856
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,580
and pretty quickly I found an endpoint

857
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,039
that was basically described as obtain

858
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,659
an access token that represents the

859
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:14,510
owner of the OAuth application and to me

860
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,899
this sounded exactly what I needed so

861
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,250
made up a little call where I sent her

862
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,010
the client ID and secret and not getting

863
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,630
an access token for the app owner it

864
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,090
wasn't me it was some other dude and

865
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,580
then good access to the API all it took

866
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,140
was a few iterations on different apps

867
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,909
and I got access to the API is the

868
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:36,010
target once again another pete one

869
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,610
sitting down and reading this

870
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,320
documentation and taking the time to

871
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,330
understand the features and you wants of

872
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,220
your target is going to expand the

873
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,600
options that are available to you and

874
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,789
make you and help you to make better

875
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:48,230
decisions that lead to higher paying

876
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,350
bugs with higher impact even googling

877
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,029
you know the target name and the feature

878
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:55,429
name might reveal github issues Stack

879
00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:57,830
Overflow posts blog posts just somewhere

880
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,070
you can read more about it finally this

881
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,679
is going to be a really fun one which is

882
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,139
read the code I could a bit of a strong

883
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:07,340
development backgrounds this is

884
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,559
something I enjoy doing

885
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,800
basically you

886
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,810
the truth of how something works right

887
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,340
you can make all the assumptions in the

888
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,840
world about how a library works but

889
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,570
until you sit down and piece it together

890
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,190
you won't know how it actually sort of

891
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,520
operates now since 2014

892
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,530
this bug had always fascinated me on

893
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,080
github.com someone reported an issue

894
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,990
with the ruby xml-rpc client may be

895
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,520
vulnerable to up remote code execution

896
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,970
and this struck me as interesting first

897
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,170
of all because I looked at they don't

898
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,550
get hub and never notice that it may be

899
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,400
an issue and second of all because well

900
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,900
I've got a background in Ruby and I know

901
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,160
that you can do some absolutely

902
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,840
marvelously terrible things and worry

903
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,860
now the premise was that this client

904
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,140
might be susceptible to RCE however the

905
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,790
research didn't go forward and test it

906
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,760
as it turns out I encounter target using

907
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,340
the same library in the wild now we'll

908
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,320
start with a walk through I go up and I

909
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,680
do my 360 I find their API and I find

910
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,920
this endpoint where after a quick ping

911
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,540
back to myself it's clear that they're

912
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,190
using this client it's advertising the

913
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,050
user agent right that's how I make the

914
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,470
connection typically however how the

915
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,300
flow goes is you offer up an XML

916
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,730
response it gets sent back the program

917
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,770
DC realizes it and does what they want

918
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,380
with it but remember this bug is about

919
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,050
object instantiation just not directly

920
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,940
lead to remote code execution that often

921
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,520
can be used to now I figured out figured

922
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,280
that p1 RC was a pretty good goal and

923
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,780
pretty much said yes please that's

924
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,180
something I want to chase thank you so I

925
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,070
decided to improve my situation of

926
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:41,460
awareness

927
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,260
turns out the full source code for this

928
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,960
client is available it's open source so

929
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,000
I sat down with my coffee I went through

930
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,850
all 639 lines of it and essentially

931
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,350
muddled my way through working out

932
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,120
payload that I could send back to the

933
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,680
target that would trigger RCE

934
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,080
and as it turns out it ended up being

935
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,520
pretty succinct after a number of

936
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,950
iterations basically if I could acquire

937
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,560
to call this server and send back this

938
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,020
payload and they've got rails installed

939
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,570
or any other library that uses these

940
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,180
really common dependencies pretty much

941
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,320
it's going to trigger RCE

942
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,910
I don't know if we could do a round of

943
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,500
applause on the strand this is the first

944
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,880
time dropping in a day on a pub

945
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,000
channel so now once again this paid at

946
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,030
p1 and it paid up he went because I went

947
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,680
through and read the code and tried to

948
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,790
get a full understanding of how

949
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,470
something was working on the back end

950
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,060
you know you can do this on the front

951
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,050
end as well

952
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,430
reading JavaScript can often were

953
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,740
available in API endpoints beta features

954
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,220
or nasty spiders over to the corner and

955
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,930
it gives you a better understanding of

956
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,520
what's going on after you send a big

957
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,070
request it doesn't just apply to code by

958
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,480
having a basic understanding of all the

959
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,530
layers of the stack can help you

960
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,240
recognize scenarios and therefore make

961
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,130
better decisions now you might want to

962
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,710
learn how HTTP works or DNS works how

963
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,250
domain name registrations work so let's

964
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,020
recap you're going to encounter a lot of

965
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,550
situations where the next steps or

966
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,880
impact are unclear look to collaborate

967
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,110
and research where something seems

968
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,250
unfamiliar you're going to absolutely

969
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,899
learn something for the next time and

970
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,570
sharing these ideas just takes you so

971
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,530
much further this will help you work to

972
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,540
make unfamiliar situations more familiar

973
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,940
like I said I had the zero dollar one

974
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,889
point bounty when I first started yeah

975
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:25,739
this has been a case of iterating over a

976
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,810
process where I build my familiarization

977
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,300
skills you also need to use information

978
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,980
available to you to get familiar with

979
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,780
what something is how it works and how

980
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,330
it might be broken

981
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,860
this pays dividends in the future and

982
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,300
you're essentially teaching yourself as

983
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,550
you go and once again don't be afraid to

984
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,929
fill in the gaps and make a calculated

985
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:44,668
guess and try something out you've got

986
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,409
so much time to test you can keep trying

987
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:50,940
and iterating now that's unfamiliar

988
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,949
situations pretty sure pretty hectic

989
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:55,260
topic it's going to start to get a

990
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,760
little bit mater as I walk into

991
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,260
evaluating goals now for emergency

992
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,540
responders there's a pretty clear goal

993
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,940
and it's preserve protect preserve and

994
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,530
protect people property and the

995
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,200
environment if you recognize that a

996
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,730
course of action will not allow you to

997
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,410
meet your goals through realistically

998
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,270
possible to me given the circumstances

999
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,580
it's not the course of action for you

1000
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,130
and that's why goals are explicitly

1001
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,290
called out your goals are important

1002
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,550
while considering a course of action

1003
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,740
sometimes you might be how to make them

1004
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,810
given the circumstances however you

1005
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,370
don't want to put yourself four steps

1006
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,930
back by taking a course of action

1007
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,000
doesn't align with your goals now I'm

1008
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,099
calling out this tweet because I did a

1009
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,900
search for it and because I have been

1010
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,420
there about a hundred times you know

1011
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,250
we've all been this person on Twitter

1012
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,890
who had a bit of a moment didn't save an

1013
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,839
open net redirect didn't test Affairs

1014
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,960
SRF you know these things happen I could

1015
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,109
do a talk about 100 100 bugs where I've

1016
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,059
submitted it's been paid out and over us

1017
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:58,619
damn I could have done this now here is

1018
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,510
my absolutely long list of goals when

1019
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,520
hunting bugs it's pretty crazy

1020
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,730
find a bug huh this covers off

1021
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,609
everything except I'm going to add in

1022
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:10,619
the goal that I put some a lot of

1023
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:11,940
thought into it before I decide on a

1024
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,599
final change for my vulnerability now

1025
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,950
once I'm at the point of assessing if

1026
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,530
the action meets my goals I'm gonna take

1027
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,960
a moment I'll look at my understanding

1028
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,819
of the situation I asked myself have

1029
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:25,079
they done everything possible to

1030
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,020
maximize impact and can I change this to

1031
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,720
make it more severe and this is a little

1032
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,280
bit of a hard exercise to do right

1033
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,390
because first of all it requires

1034
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,829
knowledge it requires a bit of

1035
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:36,809
imagination you essentially trying to

1036
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:38,040
think about everything you know about

1037
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,960
the target what you found it's possible

1038
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,460
impacts the ways in which it can be used

1039
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,049
and how it's going to communicate and

1040
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:45,450
validate then you've got to ask yourself

1041
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,040
well moving forward with this allow me

1042
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,200
to meet my goals it's a really difficult

1043
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,790
skill to learn you've got to have so

1044
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,900
much understanding of all the different

1045
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,339
layers and you're still going to

1046
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,619
encounter blanks but I want to draw a

1047
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,589
parallel let's take this as an example

1048
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:59,970
the reason why these fire fighters are

1049
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,190
outside is because going inside wouldn't

1050
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,299
allow them to meet the goals of

1051
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:05,069
protecting lives you know mostly their

1052
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:07,799
own they've evaluated their strategy and

1053
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:09,390
worked out that the building would have

1054
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,980
been added into lost course that's not

1055
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,540
worth throwing any more at it we're just

1056
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,799
going to stay outside and try and defend

1057
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:16,349
everything else in bug hunting your

1058
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:17,790
situation and your planned actions

1059
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,410
against your goals is kind of similar I

1060
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,420
wouldn't take an insecure people honor

1061
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,160
ability and plan to run with a 5 page

1062
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,930
report describing the attacks where it'd

1063
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,880
be stolen misused and need to complete

1064
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,280
nothing but mayhem because typically

1065
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,140
it's never going to pay out as a p1

1066
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,339
it'd just be a sunk cost so evaluating

1067
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,710
your goals requires you to say am i ok

1068
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,329
with this or do I think I can do

1069
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,150
something else to level up and when I'm

1070
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,680
looking at this I follow a few key

1071
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,490
points

1072
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,050
I want to talk about setting goals in

1073
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,340
some ways in which you can validate your

1074
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,960
course of action and ensure that you

1075
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,520
aren't negatively impact in this

1076
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,369
situation so first of all rerunning the

1077
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,890
playbook you've worked through a process

1078
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,840
to get where you are and basically

1079
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,360
rerunning it means taking that and going

1080
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,100
through a start to finish again that's

1081
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,430
it

1082
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,710
identifying your situation making sure

1083
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,660
you having all the information making

1084
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,520
sure you didn't miss anything and doing

1085
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,260
a short simulation of what you think you

1086
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,550
have in mind to see if you think it'll

1087
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,020
take all the boxes and obtain maximum

1088
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,780
impact to demonstrate this I want to use

1089
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,080
yet another bug so 360 and I came across

1090
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,760
a feature where you could supply a

1091
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,040
template basically it used mustache

1092
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,440
which is a templating language in Ruby

1093
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,619
now this had a fun bit off to the side

1094
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,510
where you could start pager duty it

1095
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,520
would spit in Jason representing

1096
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,140
incidents that were raised and it would

1097
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,150
send emails out

1098
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,300
I won't edit alive but basically foo is

1099
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,110
a lowercase now I did a lot of fuzzing

1100
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,300
on this because this absolutely sort of

1101
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,800
you know I knew there was something

1102
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,300
there I knew there was spiders there but

1103
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,490
I wasn't happy to arrest with you know

1104
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,619
PvP for speculation

1105
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:55,170
so I went through when I first a whole

1106
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,090
bunch of values right and eventually

1107
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,450
came across name equals dot and it

1108
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,490
returned this representation of the Ruby

1109
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,260
object and I'm like ok cool we're

1110
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,100
getting somewhere

1111
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,710
that might be a p2 let's see how much

1112
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,760
further we could take it

1113
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,130
so I started again and you know I tried

1114
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,140
something really evil which is quite

1115
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,500
curly Broadcom and putting a function in

1116
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,020
the template and well it didn't work

1117
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,690
this is probably a p10 might get minus

1118
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,010
20 points and throwing to the bottom of

1119
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,710
the leaderboard what it did allow me to

1120
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,180
work out though was basically these

1121
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,980
restrictions within my template I

1122
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,840
couldn't put spaces brackets letters or

1123
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,030
dots but a really interesting thing

1124
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,530
happened when I worked this out

1125
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,190
well I supplied name is user and I tried

1126
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,930
calling a chained function in Ruby which

1127
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,850
is basically taking instant name that's

1128
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,859
a string and calling the constant

1129
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,869
highest function on it and what that

1130
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:49,590
spelled out was hello user and you know

1131
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,660
I thought well if I've seen student dot

1132
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,710
name that would have been true but

1133
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,990
constant eyes well it's also thrown out

1134
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,500
user

1135
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,050
now what this method does in Ruby

1136
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,670
it takes a string and turns it into a

1137
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,920
reference to the class basically I can

1138
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,750
forget the string for user and turn it

1139
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,870
into a class now this struck me as p2

1140
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,220
but I thought well no there's going to

1141
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,330
be something else there and then I

1142
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,800
remembered back to my rails development

1143
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,290
and I could just chuck all on the end I

1144
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,880
thought okay now we're getting somewhere

1145
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,270
and I send in user and it spits out

1146
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,950
every single user record and I'll

1147
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,300
crashing the service because I didn't

1148
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,760
couldn't limit it at all this is

1149
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,070
definitely p1 read access to all of the

1150
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,350
data that these folks have and the

1151
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,650
ability to cordially all as well so once

1152
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,690
again this methodical work through of

1153
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,510
thinking I wonder if and trying out some

1154
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,330
different things and yeah it paid a p1

1155
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,070
again that's rerunning the playbook

1156
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,320
based on your goals if you've got the

1157
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,330
time and you haven't exhausted every

1158
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,710
option and you're just fishing blind

1159
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,840
it's a really good way to really set

1160
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,190
your thought process while being sure

1161
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,870
but you're doing everything possible to

1162
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:55,830
maximize that impact I now want to cover

1163
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,540
what I call being ambitious this is just

1164
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,070
like a really thought leader each happen

1165
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,830
right this is essentially the human and

1166
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,870
went to bug hunting typically we look at

1167
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,370
it like the triage is over here and

1168
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,770
we're over there but I want to explain

1169
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,060
it with a bit of an example so I did the

1170
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,880
360 I came across this tier 4 web

1171
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,830
applications so tier 4 penny on a tier 4

1172
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,170
level bug and it was covered in spiders

1173
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,430
you could see the dust coming off the

1174
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,260
thing and it turns out that there was a

1175
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,910
github repository with its source code

1176
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,740
in there and it didn't take long to

1177
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,910
identify an RCA so we've got RCA in tier

1178
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,670
4 it's like yeah cool I don't want that

1179
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,100
I wanted to hear one RC and I know

1180
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,630
that's just greedy of me but you know

1181
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,740
always trying to expand the knowledge

1182
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,960
and find out more about the target I was

1183
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,790
wondering if they'd let me in so all I

1184
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,170
did was reach out to the program owner

1185
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,210
and I'm like amen huh you know do you

1186
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,350
mind if I try and escalate this to a

1187
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,970
tier one and they say no go for it just

1188
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,190
don't break anything it turns out that I

1189
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,780
could access the s3 bucket and Tier one

1190
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,430
and get all of the application source

1191
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,460
code and to them this stood out as a p1

1192
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,370
you know you've you've got this person

1193
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:59,460
who can basically jump over into itea

1194
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,050
when applications for any tier 4

1195
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,000
application that's something we're glad

1196
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,610
we found out about you know we're glad

1197
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,530
the researcher tried this we definitely

1198
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,840
got value from having this program now

1199
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,430
if I just stopped at the tier 4

1200
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,660
they may not have known that and they

1201
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,640
have gotten figured out the program so

1202
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,170
it's like this mutually beneficial thing

1203
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,240
right if the program owner is willing to

1204
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,369
work with you sometimes being ambitious

1205
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:25,200
can go a really long way finally I want

1206
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,119
to cover being responsible and I want to

1207
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,800
do it for a very good reason mainly as a

1208
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,400
public service now you know in a normal

1209
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,990
talk I paused to take a water break I'm

1210
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:39,119
just gonna do one right now so this is

1211
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,920
mainly as a public service and to ensure

1212
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,030
you don't get the wrong message about

1213
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,400
some of these exploit chains bug

1214
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,079
walkthrough 360 discover an application

1215
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,369
turns out I can send it zip up to it

1216
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:53,369
with an XML file inside that XML file is

1217
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:58,319
unpacked and it leads to xx a that gives

1218
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,730
me an SSR but let's try again xx a that

1219
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,589
gives me an SSR F which basically leads

1220
00:43:04,589 --> 00:43:07,170
to AWS credentials now I reached out to

1221
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,300
the program owner and I said paid to try

1222
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,530
and escalate this a bit more one you

1223
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,730
know do you want to see this leads and

1224
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,680
the answer was nope and that's

1225
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,380
absolutely fine being responsible is

1226
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,180
about making sure you don't overstep any

1227
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,710
boundaries while you're chasing your own

1228
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,260
goals not operating with the blinders on

1229
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,089
operating out of scope making any

1230
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:25,890
decisions that may negatively impact the

1231
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:28,260
direction of the bug whenever I feel

1232
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,730
like I might be stepping out of scope

1233
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,500
I always confirm with the program or not

1234
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,210
you know if I find that submitting this

1235
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,920
as part of my process is incredibly

1236
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,200
important not only that it helps you

1237
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,849
build a rapport or a relationship with

1238
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,020
the program owner you know if you

1239
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,549
encounter something in your - sure you

1240
00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:43,069
can always send them a message

1241
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:47,099
so let's recap you need to consider your

1242
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,599
goals as part of your overall strategy

1243
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:50,520
in the goal of getting a submission is

1244
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,470
really different tack getting a p1 and

1245
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,000
they're really going to have different

1246
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,849
strategies don't be afraid to take what

1247
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:58,530
you have and go back to the start of the

1248
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,240
play book I mentioned rerunning the

1249
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,799
playbook and how he had some really good

1250
00:44:01,799 --> 00:44:02,309
results

1251
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,780
there's definitely telling you there

1252
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,859
you're going to pick up things he didn't

1253
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,450
miss and it's gonna allow you sort of

1254
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,920
pick up areas where you need to do more

1255
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,369
research if this information is missing

1256
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:13,140
practice making these informed

1257
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,460
assumptions I've called them that in

1258
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,470
every slide it's going to help you move

1259
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:17,520
forward instead of getting stuck on

1260
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,930
details you know being able to ask the

1261
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,660
question I wonder if or could this work

1262
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,030
it you know it's how I found so many of

1263
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:24,900
these different bugs

1264
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,080
that that yarn vulnerability where you

1265
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,430
know I was able to write arbitrary files

1266
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,980
that started out by me saying I wonder

1267
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,900
if yarns vulnerable to something reading

1268
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,490
a bunch of code and then hacking away

1269
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,710
and you know you've got to be ambitious

1270
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,390
the idea that if you imagine if a

1271
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,710
particular course of action will help

1272
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:44,580
you know you've got to imagine so this

1273
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,750
course of action will help you make your

1274
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,130
goals you know like how we're gonna

1275
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,570
reach out to them and you know see if

1276
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:49,860
they can give me any more information or

1277
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,740
let me do this thing you know you you

1278
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,150
have these goals in mind the program

1279
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,500
owner is probably going to be willing to

1280
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,450
help you and if you can't think of a

1281
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,890
better course of action submit the bug

1282
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,330
it's better than doing nothing in losing

1283
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,040
time and you know you're going to think

1284
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,420
of something later and remember it for

1285
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,030
next time so pretty much evaluating your

1286
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,010
goals is asking yourself hey am i okay

1287
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,080
with this as is what can I do something

1288
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,210
else to level up now I had to drop the

1289
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,360
conference name in there at least once

1290
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,390
finally let's call our taking action

1291
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,560
this is going to be the final part of

1292
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,200
the talk and it's going to be a little

1293
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,710
bit different to the previous format

1294
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,000
these are actions they're called and

1295
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,860
there is a thing that you plan for the

1296
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,900
yeren mental simulations on and your

1297
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,360
work out is it going to work and you

1298
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,950
build these actions of your goals cute

1299
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,400
accusing expectancies and this is where

1300
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,960
the firefighting actions and the hacker

1301
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,020
actions don't exactly see eye-to-eye as

1302
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,330
such a have a really poor comparison to

1303
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,850
make further along but really putting

1304
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,440
water on fire and taking the safety

1305
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,910
conscious option doing things by the

1306
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,410
book has no place in information

1307
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,320
security there's one thing I want after

1308
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,300
I take action and the target reads my

1309
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,820
reports and just absolutely one guess

1310
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,940
what that is that's right utter chaos

1311
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,590
basically weaponizing this model for

1312
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,180
navigating the unknown finding these

1313
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,980
bugs but instead of act taking actions

1314
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,300
to restore normalcy and protect the

1315
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,670
community I'm coming in and setting

1316
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,040
everything on fire chaos is a value you

1317
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,080
should hold or taking act acting you

1318
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,720
know while acting in bug bounties now

1319
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,910
within the model for us to ask bulwark

1320
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,210
occurs in a number of different places

1321
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,650
but most of all it occurs here when

1322
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,570
you're going through it now you've

1323
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,860
reached the point where hey I've got

1324
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,470
this plan I've got to work out if it

1325
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:33,690
will work you know we get the luxury

1326
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,400
being out a test over and over and

1327
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,080
determine if something works or will

1328
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,550
work you know

1329
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,870
short-circuiting that and noting

1330
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,340
something will work is beneficial and

1331
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,050
comes with time but until you get there

1332
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,790
trial and error is absolutely okay I

1333
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,480
still do it

1334
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,970
we also get this luxury of taking time

1335
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,650
to build complex vulnerabilities you

1336
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,360
know taking days to research a topic if

1337
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,030
not weeks this typically isn't seen in

1338
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,530
emergency scenarios

1339
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,420
you know we had these time constraint

1340
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,820
situations like CTS and bug - they're

1341
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,790
the exception they're not the rule so

1342
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:05,700
when I asked is this going to work I'm

1343
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,560
working at questions like this because

1344
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,420
this is where I've encountered so many

1345
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,880
issues before when I'm ready to write my

1346
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,950
report and I submit I started to ask

1347
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,470
myself questions testing things is easy

1348
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,180
trying over and over in getting the

1349
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,410
perfect chain can be something to

1350
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,800
perfect good time but this this triage

1351
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,320
process is the absolute devil once the

1352
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,210
report is submitted and communicated a

1353
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,160
whole bunch of uncertainty process is

1354
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,140
introduced into the system and really

1355
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,820
you can't control the triggers the

1356
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,980
program owners you know but what you can

1357
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,570
control is doing your very best to

1358
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,010
ensure that you've prepared and done the

1359
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:40,590
legwork and adequately conveyed in

1360
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,230
impact mitigated uncertainty spoke in a

1361
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,030
common language and covered all of the

1362
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,980
options you know you're the security

1363
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,300
person who's coming in and saying hey

1364
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,090
you have a problem they may not be

1365
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,560
security conscious you've got to

1366
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,030
communicate it in terms that you are

1367
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:56,550
understand and we've all got bad

1368
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,230
experiences with triage you can't

1369
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,910
control some of it but you can mitigate

1370
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,770
and reduce the risk of negative

1371
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:04,890
experiences I'm going to draw a really

1372
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,830
quick parallel we chuck these on our

1373
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,870
back whenever we go into environments

1374
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,240
with heat oxygen deficiency toxic

1375
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,880
elements smoke and when we get these

1376
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,890
things on they have this like pre-flight

1377
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,390
check and it's a little bit like so

1378
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:19,500
you're looking at certain parts and

1379
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,360
making sure it's up to standard and what

1380
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,120
to expect and I check mine methodically

1381
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,130
we religiously and I do the same thing

1382
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,740
over and over I don't take shortcuts I

1383
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,510
don't speed up the process and I do it

1384
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,880
for a very good reason every time it's

1385
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,620
because if I'm in here I want to know

1386
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,000
that everything I've done in me to get

1387
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,570
though these risks you know I've done

1388
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,100
you know that's something I can control

1389
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,590
to make myself safer and sort of you

1390
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,240
know it's this accountability I can have

1391
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,680
to make sure I've done things probably

1392
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,870
and really taking action is about the

1393
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,520
same thing that is writing and

1394
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,350
submitting my report I want to make a

1395
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:52,800
gate

1396
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,540
the risk that I can and that's where I

1397
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,580
make sure it takes an extra action so

1398
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:00,380
first of all demonstrating impact

1399
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,550
another bug walkthrough and I've got a

1400
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,520
rapid stuff very quickly went through

1401
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,350
the target found a github repository and

1402
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,940
there were some spiders in there and

1403
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,440
there was a reference to an app named

1404
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,960
doors or websites dotnet and pretty much

1405
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,360
it turned out to be a 404 so I calmly

1406
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,790
proceeded to go and register the domain

1407
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:21,030
right like you know I didn't rush at all

1408
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,850
I just went over there I'm registered

1409
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,290
came back to the bug and I had a look at

1410
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,000
my app which was now running in Azure

1411
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,190
and he was receiving so many web hooks

1412
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,070
and JW tees like a whole bunch these

1413
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,540
were tokens that let me call back him to

1414
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,190
the target and we're books containing

1415
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,920
really valuable information and once

1416
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,470
again paid out as a p1 that was

1417
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:41,940
demonstrating impact I could have simply

1418
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,980
alluded to the 404 of the domain but

1419
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,660
that wouldn't give me clear communicated

1420
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,240
impact saying hey this is application

1421
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,520
that you use to know that you used to

1422
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,660
run that now 404s

1423
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,480
it's not people I'm worthy you're the

1424
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,220
voice of security tell or better yet

1425
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,990
show the target while what you found is

1426
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,720
bad now along the same lines is the POC

1427
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,330
or GTFO concept this leads on from

1428
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,950
demonstrating impact basically we're

1429
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,600
looking to produce a start and end story

1430
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,340
the communicates the severity of the

1431
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,510
issue so 360 and a third-party developed

1432
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,490
training tool that was related to the

1433
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:17,250
target now having a look at the clients

1434
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,200
I could pull my information and in the

1435
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,300
classic you know classic example I can

1436
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,460
pull other people's as well and it had

1437
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,170
references to these secret keys in there

1438
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,210
but really I had no idea what this

1439
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:30,240
absolutely meant so I went back order

1440
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,040
for more situational awareness read some

1441
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,900
documentation client ID you guys in a

1442
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,530
JWT

1443
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:37,200
secret key signs it calls back to the

1444
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,120
target system allows access to the

1445
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,420
targets public API so cool ok well this

1446
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,420
this is a start let's enhance that a bit

1447
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,310
go through get more awareness it's

1448
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,320
essentially a third-party add-on target

1449
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,370
has installed this add-on

1450
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,500
therefore I could access their instance

1451
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,690
therefore I could rewrite all of their

1452
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:57,390
data in this instance and what that led

1453
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,030
to was he another p1 and I love the

1454
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,250
title line I had to reject some details

1455
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,500
but I decided not to ship posters as the

1456
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,349
co-founder

1457
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:06,489
company whose good mates with Casey

1458
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:09,339
whose account I got into it now that's

1459
00:51:09,339 --> 00:51:11,410
POC or gtfo basically I should table a

1460
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,150
start and story where it demonstrates

1461
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,190
this real-world impact I could have

1462
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,359
stopped at the ID or I could have

1463
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:17,680
stopped at postulating that could have

1464
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,119
access something further instead I

1465
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,739
demonstrated I could and I was a good

1466
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:23,079
citizen whilst doing it and finally

1467
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:27,220
mitigating uncertainty as you've seen

1468
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,749
some my reports are extremely complex

1469
00:51:28,749 --> 00:51:29,979
from the point of view of external

1470
00:51:29,979 --> 00:51:31,690
services timing attacks race conditions

1471
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:34,089
demonstrating its tips mitigating

1472
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:35,559
uncertainty is basically saying okay

1473
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,170
I've got this bug I'm going to submit it

1474
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,519
this is the chance they might not be

1475
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:41,710
able to rerun it for whatever reason now

1476
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,660
this one starts out with the user right

1477
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,309
they can push together straight to a

1478
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:48,279
build service npm get some tar packages

1479
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:50,710
provided okay you know provider stores a

1480
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,119
function they then call it with event

1481
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:55,180
api kids me malicious tar do the same

1482
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,789
build causes my malicious tar file gets

1483
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:01,150
put there another bill gets pushed the

1484
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:05,259
temp files run I see as a service yeah

1485
00:52:05,259 --> 00:52:06,970
it was a different version of the

1486
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:09,130
original bug pretty much similar vector

1487
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,200
they didn't fix it properly and yeah it

1488
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,960
worked out to be another peat one turns

1489
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,729
out they changed a few things I broke a

1490
00:52:15,729 --> 00:52:18,190
few things more however this this had

1491
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:20,049
some really sort of weird circumstances

1492
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:21,609
right it was a careful timing attack

1493
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:22,900
where I had to be on the same tenant as

1494
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,729
someone else and I could potentially

1495
00:52:24,729 --> 00:52:27,279
impact England customers I did a

1496
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:29,259
45-minute video explaining it I provided

1497
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:31,719
full source code where I wrote checks to

1498
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:33,819
make sure that I was only attacking my

1499
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:36,400
other user account and put some poison

1500
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,839
pill functionality and they so I didn't

1501
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,539
impact genuine builds that's mitigating

1502
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:42,130
uncertainty giving the program over the

1503
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,539
wall throws all the tools and all the

1504
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:45,279
evidence to support your claims in

1505
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:48,279
languages that I understand you want to

1506
00:52:48,279 --> 00:52:49,930
provide hints tricks infrastructure to

1507
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:51,430
help with your poor people out over

1508
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,710
these you want to demonstrate impact if

1509
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,999
the target permits being able to show

1510
00:52:54,999 --> 00:52:57,329
rather than speak and say speaks volumes

1511
00:52:57,329 --> 00:52:59,589
when there is uncertainty mitigated with

1512
00:52:59,589 --> 00:53:01,329
the OPI C's and diagrams of how you

1513
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:03,670
think bug works and be the translator

1514
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:05,109
between security and real world impact

1515
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:06,759
and make sure you do the legwork to

1516
00:53:06,759 --> 00:53:08,049
ensuring acceptance the issue without

1517
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:11,079
this back and forth now let's wrap it up

1518
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:13,450
I didn't cover how the process sometimes

1519
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,099
has rough edges and it takes a bit of

1520
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:17,289
getting used to being a master and stay

1521
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:17,700
on top of

1522
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,890
moving target where you need to sort of

1523
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,860
be it's absolutely exhausting and I find

1524
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,090
myself falling back to reference

1525
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:25,920
materials and so it getting stuck

1526
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,450
reading blog posts and trying to work

1527
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,450
out what my next step should be as I

1528
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,030
said before $0 first bounty one point

1529
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,670
but there isn't any magic here doing

1530
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,870
something over and over will help you

1531
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,340
get better at it and I've outlined some

1532
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,080
ways in which you can try and level up a

1533
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,990
bit quicker and spy bounty hunters we

1534
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,310
have these endless possibilities and

1535
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,280
really unfamiliar situations the

1536
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,810
requirement to have a new help up sort

1537
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:51,300
of a wealth of knowledge and you sort of

1538
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,470
you know go through so much trial and

1539
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,000
error it's a tough thing to work through

1540
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,100
and it's okay to feel stuck and like you

1541
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,570
don't need to know or you don't know

1542
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,700
where to go next you know it's something

1543
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,340
I do all the time all I'm trying to do

1544
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,140
is to get more endorsements on LinkedIn

1545
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,970
for these sort of things and sort of

1546
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:08,610
muddle my way through and that's the end

1547
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,820
of the talk I'm going to take some water

1548
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,090
and I think we move to question time now

1549
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:18,360
we do still amazing though so hey when

1550
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,150
you're ready yes there we go here is

1551
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:27,450
Rhys wow wow what a talk that that blew

1552
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:32,310
my mind in what it's so magnificent see

1553
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,740
that the way that you walk us through

1554
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,600
this you know in the beginning you're

1555
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,110
like oh where is this even going now I'm

1556
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,200
I'm just grasping at least I understand

1557
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,660
bits and pieces what's going on inside

1558
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,870
your brain super super super cool but we

1559
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,400
got a bunch of questions from the

1560
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,530
audience and that's been partaking this

1561
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:56,040
and I'm just gonna fire off with the

1562
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,080
first one here for you if you're ready

1563
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:02,160
for that absolutely so the question is I

1564
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,440
heard from different bug hunters that

1565
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,840
focusing on two or three classes of

1566
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,630
vulnerabilities and that you're more

1567
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,090
adapt on can tend to be a good method

1568
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,920
when you're testing a target instead of

1569
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,530
just trying to find everything how do

1570
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,120
you think you know how do you approach

1571
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,450
that it definitely is something right

1572
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,890
like if you want to upskill and become a

1573
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,180
master at something well you're gonna

1574
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,370
get really refining it and there's no

1575
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,810
reason why you can't do that for every

1576
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:30,480
sort of cost of vulnerability picking

1577
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,470
the one and saying I'm gonna be

1578
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,119
I'm really good at this you go help

1579
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,410
learn a whole lot of information along

1580
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:36,270
the way then the next time you go and

1581
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,830
choose a class well you might have a

1582
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,630
head start from all the other things you

1583
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:42,950
might get up sort of compared topics I I

1584
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,150
think we need both journalists and these

1585
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,830
masters of certain classes to work

1586
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,750
together remote like you know there's

1587
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,859
going to be skill sharing there's going

1588
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:51,570
to be folks who are you know it's going

1589
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,010
to get different results for the program

1590
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:53,970
owners and make the internet a safer

1591
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,150
place so I think both methods are

1592
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:59,369
absolutely valid and really I flip-flop

1593
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:02,040
between the two that bug I initially

1594
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,020
showed where I had to learn these topics

1595
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,240
of unpacking NPM packages and

1596
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,700
repackaging tartlets and timing attacks

1597
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,650
that was trying to be sort of you know

1598
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,950
mastering these really obscure topics

1599
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:17,160
that we don't see too much so I I think

1600
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,869
as long as you pick a path and say I'm

1601
00:56:18,869 --> 00:56:21,500
going that this way and you do it with

1602
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,599
the right goals and mindset I think you

1603
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:28,010
could have success no matter what cool

1604
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:31,260
so another question we got was just if

1605
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,430
you could elaborate a bit more about

1606
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,690
your mind mapping and your note-taking

1607
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,760
services like how do you approach it

1608
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,020
what are you using for sure I look I'm

1609
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,060
really old school I don't think I called

1610
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,830
it up and I'm I'm an enterprise could I

1611
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,089
write it like I work for a big blue

1612
00:56:45,089 --> 00:56:49,920
cloud I use lucidchart for capturing

1613
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,900
these mind maps because there's no set

1614
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,510
scheme I can just put in whatever I want

1615
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:57,450
and break it up however I want that's

1616
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,130
that's what I've found to work it's dead

1617
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:03,119
you know it's pretty cheap as well I'll

1618
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,470
give a shout-out to Trello as well I

1619
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:07,020
used four boards for managing my actual

1620
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:10,530
plan I found and I should do a blog post

1621
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,060
about this I found a really good system

1622
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,430
for storing both bugs and places to

1623
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,810
attack and when I learned about a new

1624
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,400
slip bug I can't provide it to the

1625
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,710
places I've already looked at and a bit

1626
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,150
about how I break up components more

1627
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:23,880
minitest so that's a lot to cover in the

1628
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,170
air so it's something I should probably

1629
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,890
cover in a blog post

1630
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,140
oh yeah my mapping lucidchart gold

1631
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,920
tracking trailer awesome hey reset I had

1632
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,390
a question now that you're talking about

1633
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,460
collaboration in there and some of the

1634
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,900
parts before you've reached out to

1635
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,960
others to help how do you how do you

1636
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,089
know who to collaborate with like you've

1637
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:48,430
been in the game for a long time you

1638
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:51,339
clearly you know have the like you're

1639
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:53,380
comfortable doing this type of thing

1640
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,790
reaching out to people in that sort of

1641
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:55,960
way like what would you what would you

1642
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,119
recommend for someone who's new to

1643
00:57:58,119 --> 00:57:59,829
forming that sort of network to fill in

1644
00:57:59,829 --> 00:58:02,260
their knowledge gaps walk up and say hi

1645
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,290
like you know the RO bug - I knew one

1646
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:07,180
person there apart from the bug for the

1647
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,700
crew and basically walking up and saying

1648
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,770
hey I don't know anything about hardware

1649
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:12,849
hacked when you're doing bit do you mind

1650
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:15,130
if I ask a bunch of questions I learned

1651
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,800
an absolute whole bunch and it wasn't

1652
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,780
scary you know good good people to work

1653
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,089
with then if you approach the one you

1654
00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:23,349
get attitude it's probably someone you

1655
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:24,849
didn't want to talk to anyway they're

1656
00:58:24,849 --> 00:58:26,380
really awesome people in this community

1657
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:29,290
and they are the majority walk up start

1658
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,900
talking and yeah people are going to be

1659
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,980
receptive people are going to share

1660
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:38,530
ideas that is definitely true speaking

1661
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:42,310
of the bug bash event you did receive a

1662
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:54,430
hammer right works so cool and the

1663
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,140
reason why you are able to find this

1664
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:00,240
really really cool bugs and doing and

1665
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,099
being able to you know materialize your

1666
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:06,339
thinking into these bugs by falling all

1667
00:59:06,339 --> 00:59:08,589
the experience that had that you had in

1668
00:59:08,589 --> 00:59:12,369
the training prior at what age did you

1669
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:16,060
learn that like is that it some because

1670
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,950
you didn't just wake up and having all

1671
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:21,069
nice things I'd say about three years

1672
00:59:21,069 --> 00:59:22,839
ago identified the process and that my

1673
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:24,369
mindset had sort of changed into

1674
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:27,040
operating this way and I don't know if

1675
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,630
it's like turning into a grumpy old man

1676
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:30,220
or if it was just reaching a certain

1677
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,349
tipping point of particular training or

1678
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:35,140
the quality of training but it was being

1679
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,550
able to identify these certain patterns

1680
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,290
that I was using over here and these

1681
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,520
patterns over here and saying hey

1682
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,910
there's this massive intersect

1683
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:44,270
and these massive similarities let's try

1684
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:45,730
and refine the process of both and

1685
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:48,620
really the bug bounty staff has sort of

1686
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,180
changed how I work with emergency

1687
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,280
services as well I think about things

1688
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,690
from a different angle I slowed down a

1689
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,400
bit more I try to take more information

1690
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,610
and I think about sort of you know there

1691
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:00,050
are some situations where I control

1692
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,810
parallels with bug bounty work so I

1693
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,490
think they complement each other right

1694
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:06,650
but yeah probably about three years ago

1695
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:08,600
it really sort of took off and that's

1696
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,880
where when I start to sort of really

1697
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,650
explore these massive chains of

1698
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:18,140
vulnerabilities cool um also you talk in

1699
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:21,170
your slide sure mentioning the 360

1700
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:24,130
overview right and I used to have to ask

1701
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,540
have you built to your automation to do

1702
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,250
that for you do you get do you get

1703
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,200
compare reports you put in your domain

1704
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,830
saying that delivers you this lease file

1705
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,290
that you dig into or how do you approach

1706
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:41,990
it huh look at the moment it's manual

1707
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:44,150
I've got some tools that I run like I

1708
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:47,630
think every hackers dream is the is the

1709
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,580
Iron Man computer system that alerts you

1710
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,900
when your coffees done and when the bugs

1711
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,060
are ready to go all right

1712
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:55,730
I think the trade-off is that that's

1713
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,530
such a rabbit hole you you have to sort

1714
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,480
of balance it balance it out because you

1715
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,300
can go so far doing that without any

1716
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,740
validation on what you're doing and if

1717
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,420
it's correct so all I've started out

1718
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:08,240
with is simple tools or sort of you know

1719
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,990
what the community provides I also

1720
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,310
mentioned that like a bit of development

1721
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:15,590
background I should mention I wasn't

1722
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:16,970
really good at it I was good at breaking

1723
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:21,370
things and shooting poor code but yeah

1724
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:24,260
basically I haven't built my own tool

1725
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,600
and yet because well I don't think I've

1726
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,480
got the baby good for it but if you want

1727
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,510
to collaborate yeah just hit me up I'll

1728
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:35,210
definitely do that this create the

1729
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:38,150
future of engines that do magic stuff

1730
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:40,310
that put magic stuff out so we can find

1731
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:41,930
the cool p1 bugs I'm done with that

1732
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,150
collaboration anyway I'm always up for

1733
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:47,360
collaboration it come to us wearing a

1734
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,450
beer or something you you're overdue

1735
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:53,390
bait your energy well that was great

1736
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:54,650

at the last Ally bash seeing you just

1740
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,960
network to tie together the people on

1741
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,310
that you landed was great you know you

1742
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,080
you went over you picked the hardware

1743
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,640
brands guys you've other people's brain

1744
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,580
it definitely sums up one of the things

1745
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,860
we recognize that you are so talented at

1746
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,440
is networking and deep diving to just

1747
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,570
bring it all together but thank you very

1748
