1
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:16,480
awesome so we have we have Anthony

2
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:19,029
Rhodes and Jeff Foley today presenting

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,730
on a tool called a mashin if you're a

4
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:23,470
bug bounty hunter who doesn't know what

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,289
a mess is they're about to be in for a

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,820
treat if you are I'm hoping that we

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:30,640
learn a little bit more about the tool

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,160
that kind of we all use and and its

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,309
functions and features a mash is one of

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,629
the tools in the recon methodology that

11
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:41,320
I talk about in the bug hunters

12
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:44,129
methodology that usually I give every

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:48,699
year or every two years and it is a

14
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,589
awesome DNS enumeration tool it is it is

15
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:53,140
one of them kind of I think the the

16
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:54,970
biggest advent you know the first the

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,940
first kind of one that set us off and

18
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,159
this kind of thing of subdomain scraping

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,349
was publisher so all over the props in

20
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,179
the world for the maintainer zuv the sub

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,510
Lister project but shortly after a mess

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:10,810
came out and some others and a mesh was

23
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:13,480
one that I use in my tool sets when I'm

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,720
doing bug bounty hunting every almost

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:21,640
every day now it's almost become as

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,890
ubiquitous as nmap to me finding finding

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,810
hosts with a match and using some of the

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,170
features as well some of the unknown

29
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:32,680
other tools in buried inside of a mesh

30
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,450
as well so I'm super happy to have Jeff

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,380
and Anthony here with us to talk about

32
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,180
EMF and guys thank you so much for being

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,229
here and I'm so glad that you're joining

34
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:47,050
us and I'll let you guys take it away

35
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:49,840
thank you very much Jason you know with

36
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:53,950
that I'd like to start by thanking

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,580
everyone that contributes to the amass

38
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:59,250
program which I think we have 13

39
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,759
contributors now some of which are

40
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,680
focused on development some testing some

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,069
documentation I mean they spend a quite

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,860
a bit of their time supporting this this

43
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:14,670
project and also of course all the

44
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,720
people that are using it like Jason and

45
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,649
all the support we get from the

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,010
community the great feedback the

47
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,370
encouragement

48
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,170
to keep making it better so it's

49
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,190
everyone that's involved that makes it

50
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:32,950
possible and with that feedback we've

51
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:36,700
been getting a lot of great questions

52
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:39,010
about some of the new features and the

53
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:43,260
configuration options and you know it's

54
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,260
gotten potentially a little bit more

55
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,620
complicated to take full advantage of it

56
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:54,340
so that's what we're going to focus on

57
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:58,000
today is Anthony's put together our

58
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,590
tailored this material to address those

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,160
questions that we've been getting from

60
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,160
the community next slide

61
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,319
you

62
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,410
you

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,260
all right so

64
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:26,410
I'm Jeff Foley I I have a long history

65
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:33,670
of working with cyber warfare and when I

66
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:36,359
came to doing more commercial work and I

67
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:40,359
had a lot of clients that needed this

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,640
they needed visibility they needed to

69
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,760
understand their exposure better and it

70
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,559
just became something that I did all the

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,980
time when I was engaged with these

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,980
clients

73
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,480
I realized that the community was

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,799
missing a tool like this a complete tool

75
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,629
that could make this easy and not break

76
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,129
it up into several steps that had to be

77
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:08,879
you know scripted and all the data

78
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:12,159
parsed and normalized and put together I

79
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:17,889
figured it was time to just have one

80
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:22,409
tool that could could do all this so

81
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:22,410
that's what got this project started

82
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,490
I was just me at first because I wrote

83
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:32,490
it for myself but uh within or was less

84
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:37,260
than a year

85
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:41,830
wasp asked me if I would like to make it

86
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:47,020
Anna wass project and then I was honored

87
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:48,580
to accept their invitation some people

88
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:54,400
have asked me if this is what I do ever

89
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:56,340
all day um it's not just the other night

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,299
actually someone asks me if I'm paid to

91
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:04,659
develop mass and that would be nice but

92
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:10,030
I'm not I I told the person who asked me

93
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:14,290
I said I'm just a nice guy but um my day

94
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:18,010
job is I I do management of offensive

95
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:20,770
security services right now it's with

96
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:24,070
National Grid but I've been doing that

97
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,479
kind of work for quite a while and if

98
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:30,640
you didn't already know you can find me

99
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:34,870
at these two locations to ask questions

100
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:38,159
about a mass or reach us for if you're

101
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,160
interested in becoming a contributor

102
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:51,280
see

103
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:54,129
next slide alright so the person who is

104
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,748
going to share all this information with

105
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:59,770
you today though is Anthony Rhodes he's

106
00:05:55,749 --> 00:06:02,469
one of our greatest contributors he's

107
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:07,090
been spending a lot of time enhancing

108
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:10,840
the amass project he also is on our team

109
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:13,119
and National Grid and he has a long

110
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,150
history as well of doing this kind of

111
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,939
work professionally he's also a bug

112
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,099
bounty hunter so I think he really can

113
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:24,279
understand where a lot of you are coming

114
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:26,169
from and how you use this and I think he

115
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,439
was really the right person to tailor

116
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:33,310
the material and deliver it to today you

117
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:38,050
can find him at these locations to ask

118
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:40,569
more questions engage this team and with

119
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,719
that I would like to introduce Anthony

120
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:46,050
Rhodes he's going to take it away from

121
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:46,050
here

122
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:52,250
thanks Jeff yeah today I'm going to be

123
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,440
talking about the math project and how

124
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:59,460
book binding hunters can leverage it to

125
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,460
no hind bugs so I've been doing pen

126
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,919
testing a lot in the past you know five

127
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,539
years and you know one of the biggest

128
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:11,100
issues at least in the beginning of an

129
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:15,690
engagement as we get whatever scope the

130
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:19,140
client gives us and then we would do

131
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:22,040
some quick enumerations to try to just

132
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:27,360
see you know just validate it really and

133
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:29,070
a lot of times we don't know planning

134
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
more and then we'd have to go back and

135
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:38,810
see if you know everything was stoked

136
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:44,640
right so math really helps you know

137
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:48,020
enumerated you know those extra names so

138
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:52,200
yeah at least for bug bounty hunters I

139
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:54,270
know a lot of cases you can get like

140
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,150
ambiguous scopes you know everything

141
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:05,719
under a certain domain so a math can

142
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:09,570
really help numerous those subdomains so

143
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,330
there's a number of other features so

144
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:15,240
just tracking you know the changes

145
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:20,340
between your enumerations and

146
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:23,160
visualizing the findings as well so

147
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:27,119
let's look at your typical scope for an

148
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:31,070
engagement you might just get like IP

149
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,970
range like I said earlier you could get

150
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:38,840
domain maybe with a wild card saying

151
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:41,850
everything under this domain is in scope

152
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:45,260
this is the use of the type of scope

153
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:47,430
that mass really shines with because

154
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,140
pretty much everything that comes out of

155
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,709
a mass will be valid for this kind of

156
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:55,170
scope whereas if you started out with a

157
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,330
network range you'd have to go back

158
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:00,620
through and make sure that the resolve

159
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,620
names match up of the network

160
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,480
but then I'm asked and also accept some

161
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,380
other different types of scopes so if

162
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,290
you want to just give it an organization

163
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,670
name say it's like a Red Team assessment

164
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,650
or you really just don't know anything

165
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:19,569
about the organization yet you could

166
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:21,340
just give it to a company name and you

167
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,320
can also give it an ASN number I don't

168
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:37,090
know if I've ever seen the scope of the

169
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:40,050
NASA number so but it's possible yeah so

170
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,550
look into the architecture a little bit

171
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,069
so this is where a mass really

172
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,270
differentiates itself from other tools

173
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,960
that performs of the meaning of

174
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:52,449
enumeration every resolve name gets that

175
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,390
back into the system where alterations

176
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,990
and recursive reforesting can then be

177
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:02,400
applied the cycle then repeats itself

178
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:05,200
until a mass can no longer find anything

179
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:09,209
everything is then stored into a graph

180
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:15,910
database which then can be later queried

181
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:20,530
know about this is that if you do have a

182
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:27,219
long-running enumeration say you really

183
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:28,510
gave a huge brute force list or you know

184
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,140
you might crazy on some of your

185
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:34,360
alteration settings if you're a

186
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,390
numeration is taking too long you can

187
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:42,700
kill it but you'll still have all the

188
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:44,260
results the progress so far and then the

189
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,000
next time you run an enumeration all

190
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,120
those results get fed back in right in

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,420
the beginning so it's really nice

192
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,420
feature

193
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,769
some frequently asked questions about

194
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:10,949
the project and the mass handle DNS

195
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:15,899
wildcards yes this is a huge problem for

196
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:18,599
the main numeration some DNS servers

197
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:22,100
will reply to any subdomain under a

198
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,670
given route to me so mash can handle oh

199
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,860
it's gotten better

200
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:30,510
over the past year or two if there's if

201
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,850
anyone ever has learning issues where

202
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:38,519
all of a sudden your enumeration just

203
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:40,500
blows up because you know fail detect a

204
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,850
wild-card yeah definitely hit us up on a

205
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:46,730
discord channel or on github because we

206
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:52,889
really like to make sure that this

207
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:55,079
feature is where it needs to be next

208
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:58,550
most frequently asked question is do we

209
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,779
support rate limiting on how fast you go

210
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:04,170
this is a more recent question

211
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:07,110
historically we had imposed their own

212
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:14,610
artificial limits just in the

213
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:18,209
architecture where we basically had

214
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:24,180
defaults that users won't be able to

215
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:26,099
configure and then you know we had

216
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:30,120
people on both sides of the spectrum

217
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,339
people are like I have no the gigabit

218
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,089
pipe I really need this to go faster or

219
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:38,010
I have you know much more bandwidth I

220
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:40,410
really need this thing to fly or we had

221
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:43,290
other people that have you know very

222
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:46,620
small pipes now I have to run us through

223
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:48,410
this bpn connection or I just don't have

224
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,209
a good internet connection

225
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:54,120
and a mass was failing because

226
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:55,290
everything was getting dropped centering

227
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,209
way too much traffic for their

228
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:03,389
connection so we ended up making that

229
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:06,439
configurable and I'll go into detail on

230
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:10,790
certain you know how to set that

231
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,790
configuration in the future

232
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,730
most frequently asked question is to be

233
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,780
do alterations now this is a feature

234
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:28,560
that I worked on a lot this year based

235
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:33,589
on a lot of my pen testing experience so

236
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:36,260
a lot of organizations will have their

237
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:49,560
you know their web server

238
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:53,880
www.google.com/mapmaker - you 88 you

239
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:56,790
know testing things like that so what a

240
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,640
math can do it'll it'll take every

241
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:03,060
resolved name and it will try to you

242
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:07,620
know append those suffixes and it also

243
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:11,310
those prefixes and but also if it

244
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:17,430
notices any fixes or suffixes it'll like

245
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:23,150
change those so here's some more notes

246
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:27,800
on alteration it also uh flips numbers

247
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:30,120
adds numbers so if I see the one it'll

248
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,130
change that through you know one through

249
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,690
ten or one through nine

250
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:39,600
then a zero it'll also try adding a

251
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:44,880
number so really it'll turn one group to

252
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:49,860
1 through 99 like I said for suffixes

253
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,020
prefixes swapping those fuzzy label

254
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:58,830
searches that's really what that means

255
00:14:52,020 --> 00:15:03,839
there's like 3 no basic operations

256
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:06,240
adding subtracting and swapping and so

257
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,970
it'll go through and it'll like perform

258
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,150
one of those operations beyond a random

259
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:16,140
character so in this case like you know

260
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:18,800
randomly flipping the assam us - okay

261
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:22,710
okay and you could see how that could

262
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,650
generate some hits that wouldn't

263
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,360
otherwise been generated and then we

264
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,860
have some artificial intelligence in

265
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,500
here too

266
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:35,540
those line up so we do a predictive

267
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:39,650
Markov model this can really help if you

268
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:41,230
have a lot of names especially longer

269
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:44,860
names that follow like a given pattern

270
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:48,410
this can really help you know pull out

271
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,020
all of the names of follow a certain

272
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,699
pattern because it's really good at you

273
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:59,720
know learning based on the feedback

274
00:15:52,700 --> 00:16:06,590
against so that's enough slide with the

275
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:08,900
show off some of the tool so for those

276
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:12,320
familiar with the mass this might look a

277
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:19,699
little different this weekend we're

278
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:21,590
going to be releasing the 3.0 version so

279
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,660
one of our you know one of the biggest

280
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:27,950
problems we've had with this project is

281
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:30,439
that we have about five or so tools that

282
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:34,940
are part of the amass project but every

283
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:37,010
one where a lot of people only use you

284
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:41,120
know the main subdomain enumeration tool

285
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:45,110
and they didn't even know that other

286
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:48,920
tools exists so we decided to move

287
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:51,080
everything into the amass tool and then

288
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,910
you can execute the separate tools

289
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:58,490
that's up condemns so yeah for those

290
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:01,459
that are familiar with the old tools a

291
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:05,390
math lab metonym mange now I'm a think

292
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:13,640
oh this is for discovering new root

293
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:17,690
level domains mass proper is now a math

294
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:21,110
and um this is for a year you know flip

295
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:24,890
your main enumeration massive is now

296
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:27,260
just under the bid sub-command mascot

297
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:35,990
tracker is under the track sub commander

298
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:38,000
and a mascot DB is only this DB so the

299
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,840
first tool we're going to talk about is

300
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,610
the Intel tool

301
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,070
so if you're given if you have like a

302
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:49,219
single domain and you want to find other

303
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:54,889
domains that are related to it you know

304
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:57,590
so you give it you know awash calm you

305
00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:01,340
wanted to see if that organization owned

306
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:05,809
other domains that aren't subdomain off

307
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:11,149
of that then you would use this tool you

308
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:18,670
can give it addresses essence net blocks

309
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:21,320
an organization string so in this case

310
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,630
we're starting off we just have an

311
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,330
organization Utica College

312
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:29,540
so the in telescope command that will

313
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:33,850
give us the s number and then we can

314
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:37,370
feed that back in and it'll give us B

315
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:40,240
it'll take me a s number grab the net

316
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:46,129
blocks that are associated to that and

317
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:51,790
then reverse resolve those to grab out

318
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:58,429
any level domains that it can and then

319
00:18:51,790 --> 00:19:00,649
it also does certificate grabbing then

320
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:03,140
you can specify as the port as well to

321
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,390
do that so where it reaches out to like

322
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,309
four four four three to try to grab a

323
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:13,130
certificate see if we can pull up that

324
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:16,280
domain name out of that so another good

325
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:19,070
feature about this tool is that you can

326
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,850
give it the - who is command or as a

327
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:25,309
parameter

328
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:29,780
and it will then perform reverse who is

329
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:36,139
look lookups in what reversed who is

330
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:39,670
query is is there's many api's websites

331
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:43,220
out there that offer this service

332
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:45,050
basically when you give it a domain it

333
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,559
will take like the registrant email

334
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:51,168
address out yeah for the registrant

335
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,290
organization and then it'll submit those

336
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:59,740
as a query to these

337
00:19:54,290 --> 00:20:05,300
ap is and then those api's will return

338
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:11,060
any domain that's registered under those

339
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:15,710
same details and in a lot of cases this

340
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:18,139
can really just explode your results and

341
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,240
this was also the primary reason why

342
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,950
this isn't just automatically included

343
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:28,700
in the subject subdomain enumeration

344
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:35,000
subcommittee because a lot of times you

345
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:36,050
might find that the domains in here

346
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,490
aren't really related to your

347
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:44,030
organization so like a big example that

348
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:46,250
I had in my past life as a pen testers I

349
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:52,850
thought an organization where the

350
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:55,190
network admin was labeled her he had

351
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:58,360
registered business domains with the

352
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:01,100
same email address as a personal domain

353
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:06,520
so a bunch of his personal website ended

354
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:09,980
up in this enumeration so yeah

355
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:15,620
definitely go through the output of this

356
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:17,360
tool if you have a wider range you could

357
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,899
also give it to this tool and it'll

358
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:24,949
perform the same thing basically exactly

359
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:32,420
what the ASM does skipping the step of

360
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:35,630
doing the ASN to netwok conversion and

361
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:39,230
now we'll go on to the meat potatoes of

362
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:42,140
the enhanced tool the math union

363
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:45,790
sub-command so this is probably the one

364
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,790
that most everyone is familiar with

365
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:52,520
because does all the work it has a

366
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,840
number of command line flags a lot of

367
00:21:52,520 --> 00:22:01,030
these can be set in configuration file

368
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:05,360
there are some exclusions to that

369
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:07,690
particularly like anything that changes

370
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,689
the output

371
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:19,800
like the - ipv4 or the - ipv6 or the you

372
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:21,690
know - demo those really are a Bachelor

373
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,750
those really just control what is

374
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,460
printed out from me a math tool so you

375
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,970
don't specify those in the config file

376
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,370
but most everything else can be

377
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:37,170
specified on the command line except for

378
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:40,080
really advanced tweaking there's a

379
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:42,330
number of like alterations tweaks that

380
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:47,428
cannot be specified on the command line

381
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:52,610
and that's just an effort to not have

382
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:59,730
such a huge number of command line flags

383
00:22:52,610 --> 00:23:04,169
as you can see there's already plenty so

384
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:06,750
a mass pulls from a lot of posting data

385
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:10,140
sources if you want to just ever get a

386
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:14,309
list of what it's pulling from you can

387
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:16,290
give us a - list parameter that'll give

388
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:23,760
you everything it you can see here it's

389
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:28,950
like 20 to 30 and you can also black

390
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:32,460
with any of these say you just you know

391
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:35,070
don't want to be crawling archives you

392
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,710
can get rid of the archive say you don't

393
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:39,600
want to hit virustotal for whatever

394
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,510
reason you just tell it to ignore

395
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,500
desires total or if you're just curious

396
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:48,960
about like what the mass is going to be

397
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,880
hitting right

398
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,550
other than the DNS resolvers you

399
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,020
configure you know this is just a good

400
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:59,639
way to easily get that information and

401
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,160
especially because we are constantly

402
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,410
adding to this list if you're ever just

403
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,360
curious if like anything new that it

404
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:11,250
definitely hit this parameter up

405
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,719
alienvault is one of our most recent

406
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:20,000
ones and that's definitely been really

407
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,000
lucrative terms of what it generates

408
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:33,210
so the - passive parameter will run a

409
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:39,299
maximum in - in passive mode and this

410
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:41,509
can be used as a dry run because what it

411
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:44,100
does is it just reaches out to those

412
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:47,450
sources that I mentioned on the previous

413
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:51,570
slide it doesn't do any active

414
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:56,369
resolution root forcing alterations or

415
00:24:51,570 --> 00:25:00,600
anything like that so this can be a good

416
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:03,230
debugging tool because if you are if you

417
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:07,259
think you are having like Network issues

418
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:16,730
where maybe you're you configured this

419
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:22,019
to be like pushing too much traffic then

420
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:25,889
you can use this to just query the open

421
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:27,179
source intelligence services which

422
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:35,699
shouldn't generate too much traffic at

423
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:38,549
all oh yeah once you do your dry warrant

424
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:44,159
run then you can run it without passive

425
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:46,168
and what this does is it'll take you

426
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,080
know all the info from those sources and

427
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:55,169
then it tries to resolve them it'll by

428
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:58,649
default it will perform alterations you

429
00:25:55,169 --> 00:26:00,929
can tell it to be brute-forcing but

430
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:02,518
still like the only thing that's really

431
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:06,539
doing other than reaching out to the

432
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:08,580
open source intelligence feed is domain

433
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:10,619
name resolution so this is kind of a

434
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,649
middle ground between a completely

435
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:16,320
passive mode and like a fully active

436
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:18,239
mode where you're actually generating

437
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,490
queries against the target

438
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:28,559
infrastructure aside from the DNS

439
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:30,419
servers so there's a - active mode which

440
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,550
will include like certificate

441
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:36,850
certificate grabbing and zone transfers

442
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:40,460
you can give it a bunch of ports to

443
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:42,439
that's the truly active mode where

444
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:47,840
you're actually targeting the IP then

445
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:49,790
your target infrastructure so what can

446
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,959
you do once you've done an enumeration

447
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:56,990
and you want to look at the results you

448
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,500
can use the visualization tool under the

449
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:05,150
visits of command it can generate a

450
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:07,850
number of different types of

451
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:10,490
visualizations I mean they're all really

452
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,610
just you know visualizations of the

453
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:18,470
graph database because the math keeps

454
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:21,290
everything and this network graph so if

455
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:26,650
you're familiar with a d3.js library it

456
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:26,649
can generate an HTML file that'll

457
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:35,210
that'll show you know the graph or if

458
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:41,000
you have you know larger amount of

459
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:44,450
results you can do the the guffy or the

460
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,280
grass trees options those are much

461
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:52,580
better at handling huge numbers are huge

462
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,139
graphs and then if you want like some

463
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,750
interactivity and you have a multi go

464
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,780
license you'll also have an output multi

465
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:05,060
go CSV and then you can interactively

466
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:12,230
play with the data so this is an example

467
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:15,730
of the d3.js visualization the center

468
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:21,290
right there would be OS org we're like

469
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:25,940
level domain is the Reds the green are

470
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:29,690
your a records you know the orange dots

471
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,910
are all your IP addresses the pink is

472
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:35,750
your net blocks and then your the blue

473
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:37,790
dots that all the pink go into are your

474
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:41,320
a offense and then all the rest of the

475
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,320
colors are just different DNS records

476
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:53,110
well so you know after you're taking a

477
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:56,260
look at your data the tracker tool can

478
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:59,370
really help you know give you like a

479
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:02,260
brief summary of all the changes between

480
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:07,300
say an enumeration you did several

481
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:09,990
months ago so one you just fit now by

482
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:14,260
default it'll show the differences

483
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:19,150
between the most recent enumeration and

484
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:21,760
all the past ones this I think is really

485
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:25,780
key feature for bug Monte hunters

486
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,120
because you know say you have you know

487
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:31,750
it's just a continuous window you can

488
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:35,379
just continuously run a masking or

489
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:38,770
weekly daily you know whatever just keep

490
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:41,980
running it and then you could just run

491
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:45,220
the tracker tool and if you see any new

492
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:51,120
added subdomains then BAM you just have

493
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:55,450
another target so this is an example of

494
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:58,899
a couple tracker out for some

495
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:01,330
enumerations a lark not too particularly

496
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,820
interesting in this case it's really

497
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,100
just showing that some of these are

498
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:11,500
cloud resources and they swap IPs

499
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:12,939
all the time you can have it show the

500
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,250
entire history so it would be the

501
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:24,340
differences

502
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:28,450
you know every enumeration so then you

503
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:33,879
have the the database tool and so you

504
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:38,050
have a lot of enumerations in your

505
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:44,050
database you can have this you can give

506
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:47,889
it a - enum and then a number and it'll

507
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:50,139
show you the results of that particular

508
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:54,240
enumeration if you wanted to know what

509
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:58,180
numbers you saying use the - list flag

510
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,170
you can see that here let me lift all

511
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,240
the enumeration

512
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:04,390
we have three say I want to look at the

513
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,850
first one you specify that with a dash

514
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:10,450
show and then there gets you all the

515
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:13,439
output so if you ever want to go back in

516
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:16,780
time and that be results this is great

517
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:21,340
in the future we're definitely looking

518
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:24,100
to expand this tool to include a lot

519
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:28,209
more database operations you know say

520
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:30,639
you did have an enumeration where you

521
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,280
immediately recognize that you mess up

522
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,550
some configuration you kill it right

523
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,350
away

524
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,389
well your tracker is gonna be like well

525
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,159
everything was removed from the most

526
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,630
recent one to the last one because the

527
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,370
most recent one didn't find anything

528
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:47,080
you killed it immediately so eventually

529
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,090
we're going to allow that database tool

530
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,399
to handle those kind of situations where

531
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:59,260
it will allow you to delete the

532
00:31:50,400 --> 00:32:05,170
enumeration so let's hop into the config

533
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:07,810
file by default the output directory for

534
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,620
Masse's just in your home directory was

535
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:11,760
relatively new

536
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:14,320
before it was a math output in your

537
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,950
current working directory of wherever

538
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,179
you're running a mess now it's just in

539
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:24,130
the home directory unless you specify

540
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:26,970
otherwise maximum DNS queries like I

541
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:29,110
said before this is the simultaneous

542
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:34,210
number of DNS queries that can be

543
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:37,570
happening at any time on your typical

544
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:43,980
internet connection I would say play

545
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:46,899
with it you know under ten thousand I

546
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,720
mean certainly try yeah whatever you

547
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,730
want but I think in our testing you know

548
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,390
under ten thousand has been pretty

549
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:59,080
reliable you do have really really bad

550
00:32:54,390 --> 00:33:02,200
connection you know a hundred might be a

551
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,879
some point start when you're

552
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,070
troubleshooting or trying to figure out

553
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:12,040
like really fine tune in to see how much

554
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:12,790
your connection can handle so then we

555
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,240
have

556
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:18,010
different section for the different you

557
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,590
know functionalities with the

558
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:23,620
enumeration

559
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:25,629
so the to configure brute force you

560
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,510
would add a brute force section and you

561
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:31,600
can enable it and then if you want to do

562
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:35,790
recursive brute forcing or that's if it

563
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,679
finds a sub domain as well then try to

564
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:42,190
brute force subdomains off of that sub

565
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:50,410
to me you know you know keep going as

566
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:51,910
long as it can obviously that's it if

567
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,890
you were just to do that by itself

568
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:59,350
without any limit it could go on forever

569
00:33:53,890 --> 00:34:03,130
right so we have a limiter in there

570
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:06,129
minimum for recursive and what that does

571
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:09,280
is when it's set to three as I have an

572
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:14,830
example here it has to see three sub

573
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:23,950
domains in a given position before it'll

574
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:29,020
try to recurse to the next one deeper we

575
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:32,500
say you have like WWE google calm amides

576
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:38,290
like three sub needs of C three sub

577
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:43,230
domains in the www field to be able to

578
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:48,489
recurse beyond that to see if like dev

579
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:54,460
wwe.com exists you can give it a word

580
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:56,319
list file and that's the word list of

581
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,080
the gates for brute force thing by

582
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:04,170
default I think we use the word list

583
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,170
that has a couple thousand words in it

584
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:10,780
then we have the alterations

585
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:14,140
configuration and that's enabled by

586
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:16,900
default we have so if you remember back

587
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,089
to that slide where I talked about all

588
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:22,390
the different types of alterations you

589
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:25,200
can turn on and off each one of those

590
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:25,200
separately

591
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:32,710
if you want to just add suffixes in

592
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:34,740
prefixes and you know set add words the

593
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,180
true if you want to just do the numbers

594
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,040
you know add numbers you know but that's

595
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,470
true if you don't want it to be there

596
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,910
those with a pulse pretty

597
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,609
straightforward if you want to just do

598
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:45,790
flipping instead of doing additive

599
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,640
alterations

600
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,980
then there's options for that with

601
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,049
flipped words input numbers you can also

602
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:58,170
specify the word list the default word

603
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:59,710
list has about 200 of the most common

604
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:04,570
prefixes suffixes

605
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:11,560
we've seen and then for the fuzzy

606
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:13,570
searches you can set the edit distance

607
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,990
which that's really just the number of

608
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:20,290
changes little make really under how

609
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:22,509
much you extreme case that you want to

610
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:26,380
go crazy you should probably keep just

611
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:29,460
one because increasing any higher will

612
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:32,010
drastically increase the number of tries

613
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,330
and then we have a you know the domains

614
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,540
section where you can specify it a

615
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:38,890
domain or any number of them it's really

616
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:42,790
if you want to specify more domains just

617
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:48,040
add a new line another you know domain

618
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:53,380
key value pair underneath so yeah this

619
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:56,770
was kind of like a more quiet profile

620
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,810
for a mass so say we want to do

621
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:02,650
something a little more active you know

622
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:04,779
I bump up our DNS queries 2000 and we

623
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,790
enable an active mode that's a portable

624
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:10,210
core forestry so it's grabbing like the

625
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:14,619
most common port that you're serving

626
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:17,619
against ourselves to get done we lower

627
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:21,940
minimum for recursive so only needs to

628
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:25,150
set I only need to see two labels before

629
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:27,160
it recursive deeper and then we do the

630
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,240
same thing for alterations so only needs

631
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,930
to see you know two suffixes or prefixes

632
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,930
before it starts flipping

633
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,770
so we can see you know like you can you

634
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:45,770
know really play with these settings -

635
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:53,730
you know achieve a good balance between

636
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:55,140
taking forever and getting results now

637
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,930
if you really want to go crazy you have

638
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,560
a big pipe you can set the DNS queries

639
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:05,460
to ten thousand at any given time you

640
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:07,620
can give it multiple word lists and you

641
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:12,630
don't have to worry about using like any

642
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:14,400
bosch foo to duplicate any duplicates in

643
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:18,480
those word lists a map will take care of

644
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,450
that all for you so obviously a lot of

645
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,060
your wordless are bound to have you know

646
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:26,490
duplicates amongst each other because

647
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:31,440
they're almost always built on most

648
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:39,950
common we've seen this and you can do

649
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:43,110
the same thing for alterations so that's

650
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:44,810
about it for as far as like performance

651
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:51,060
tweaking now I'm going to talk about

652
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:55,680
resolver and a source of confusion I

653
00:38:51,060 --> 00:39:01,440
think for a lot of our users also a pain

654
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:04,109
point for the dev team because some

655
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:12,750
resolvers don't return accurate results

656
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:19,170
some revolvers change the the answers

657
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:24,480
you know I think like CloudFlare quad

658
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:31,500
nine offer some you know protection

659
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:35,880
against malicious domain features they

660
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:38,940
also seem to just answer incorrectly

661
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,820
otherwise - but an interesting note is

662
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:45,380
that a lot of their secondary DNS

663
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:47,310
servers don't have that censorship

664
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,579
something we found interesting so you'll

665
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,549
see

666
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:54,420
here we have a lot of secondary for a

667
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:56,430
lot of you it just one second Anthony

668
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,759
I'm gonna fix this screen on the stream

669
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,169
for you our screen on my end froze for a

670
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:08,549
second so I'm sorry for the interruption

671
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:11,099
real quick my zoom our site is streaming

672
00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:14,219
software decided to stop showing your

673
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:17,789
screen for a second there we go alright

674
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:24,599
now we're back sorry about that when I

675
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:26,819
was alas wide that we saw yeah I think

676
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:31,829
it was that one yeah so I'm sorry about

677
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:36,479
that okay so I'll just show off the last

678
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:40,950
couple of slides I was talking to no big

679
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:46,799
deal yeah quick recap the past 10

680
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:48,328
minutes no maximum ki netic yeah we have

681
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:52,229
a brute-force section alteration

682
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:54,660
check-in section you know you can really

683
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:59,788
tweak this stuff and now I'm back to

684
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:03,420
where we were yeah so you can set any

685
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:09,690
number of resolvers Wow as you should be

686
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:11,160
able to see the lot of the primaries for

687
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:15,839
missing because they don't give us good

688
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,609
results if you ever find a resolver in

689
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,549
our default list and this is the default

690
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:23,420
list by the way

691
00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:25,709
that gives you incorrect results or

692
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,890
inconsistent results from what you think

693
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:33,058
should be there definitely let us know

694
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:36,598
again the score Channel github issue let

695
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:38,459
us know and we'll take care of it cuz we

696
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:42,989
like to we like to make sure that the

697
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:47,989
results are you know accurate for the

698
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:53,039
tool yeah so we had quite a few users

699
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:55,440
really go crazy with this section they

700
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,359
they really so what a mass does is it

701
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,510
spreads out all your DNS traffic over

702
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:04,400
these resolvers so you know

703
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:07,849
the obvious next step is you know I can

704
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:12,109
support more traffic if I just add more

705
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:14,930
results right people will add like over

706
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:19,098
a thousand resolver slip list juh mask

707
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:22,848
and handle just fine except for then we

708
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:25,490
get a github issue that says oh we ran

709
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:27,470
out of packets so we have available file

710
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,540
descriptors that's because their system

711
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:32,509
was configured whether like a really low

712
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:34,700
and for file descriptors a mask

713
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,440
opens the socket for every result is

714
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:40,009
that you can bake there so just make

715
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:50,270
sure that your system is configured to

716
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:52,730
support yeah we have a number of

717
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:57,680
features that you can really tweak for

718
00:42:52,730 --> 00:43:01,089
the you know setting your scope you now

719
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,618
say you want to do certificate polling

720
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:06,200
but you only want to reach out to

721
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:08,750
certain for story or you just want to go

722
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,890
crazy and you want to hit all supports

723
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,350
you know you can list any number of

724
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:16,460
ports in there and it'll hit all of them

725
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,460
[Music]

726
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:23,089
you can also add any number of domains

727
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:28,280
you want obviously the more domains you

728
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:32,390
add uh it'll increase how long the

729
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:37,970
enumeration will take this thing can run

730
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:42,319
you know for weeks as we've tested if

731
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:46,490
you ever find a sub domain that you've

732
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:49,270
know is out of scope then you can

733
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:57,979
blacklist it under the blacklisted

734
00:43:49,270 --> 00:44:00,200
section so just a quick note here if you

735
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,849
do find issues with the yo wildcard

736
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,960
detection you are detecting a wildcard

737
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:07,609
under a given subdomains but the math is

738
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,410
it detecting it and it's throwing off

739
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:11,450
the results you know if you want a quick

740
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:14,109
fix you can add it to the blacklisted

741
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:14,109
section

742
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:19,610
and then you know that'll give us time

743
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:22,760
to actually respond to the issue and you

744
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:24,800
know get a math mix-up again you know we

745
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,560
can't always be like super responsive

746
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:34,040
but we try to be as responsive as

747
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:38,840
possible so yeah a number of the

748
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:41,750
open-source data sources that we pull

749
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:45,170
from support API keys some of these are

750
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:48,980
paid for some of these are free I

751
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:50,480
believe alienvault is free twitter is

752
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,160
obviously free I don't know if we really

753
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,840
have any fruit pulp but we get from

754
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,430
Twitter that much but it'll search

755
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:04,270
tweets or sublimate you can get shown in

756
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:07,279
for pretty cheap but yeah if you do have

757
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:13,040
you know any of these it'll gladly take

758
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:18,710
them and leverage their api's if there

759
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:20,630
is if any of you out there are using you

760
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:22,370
know commercial products or even you

761
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:24,560
know free products out there that have

762
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:26,960
AP is that now provide subdomain

763
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,420
enumeration and you don't see them in a

764
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,130
map already you know please open a

765
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:34,670
github issue we love adding these

766
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:37,340
sources and we love being able to you

767
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:43,160
know in just everything that you want to

768
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:48,230
be a win just and just one final note on

769
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:50,450
this slide is that you can the API key

770
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:52,250
is what kind of custom to each service

771
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:54,470
so you can see some of them are username

772
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:58,070
password some of them API key and a

773
00:45:54,470 --> 00:46:03,470
secret the mobile merged API key so the

774
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:07,040
default configuration file will have all

775
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:11,359
the configuration options possible for a

776
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:15,980
mess commented out it has all these so

777
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:18,080
you know which data source requires what

778
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:24,450
kind of API key what kind of a

779
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:29,250
sonication so

780
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:31,710
about it that we have for going through

781
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:36,000
the configuration and now the deep dive

782
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:39,680
into how the Tool Works yeah

783
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:44,670
the mass perform sub domain enumeration

784
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:48,480
in a cyclic manner and it can really

785
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:51,210
help you guys you know find no

786
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,390
quote/unquote hidden posts out there

787
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:57,359
virtual hosts or no and you know if

788
00:46:54,390 --> 00:47:01,020
anyone has any questions ideas future

789
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:05,310
requests issues the whole new interface

790
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:06,119
is annoying hopefully you know we're

791
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:09,328
very friendly uh

792
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:14,940
and we submit an issue or hit us up on

793
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:17,670
the dashboard so yeah you can get it

794
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:21,000
from github we have a project page for a

795
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:27,540
lot we have snap craft packages which i

796
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:29,609
think is our primary way at least from

797
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,130
what I gather most of our users of Cali

798
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:34,078
I'm going to and other Linux

799
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:36,030
distributions tend to primarily snap

800
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,359
crap unless they're building from stores

801
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:40,140
if you have Mac we can also do route

802
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,078
test

803
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:47,400
I also just have binaries on the github

804
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:48,780
page so if you have Windows even I don't

805
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,520
think we have a lot of Windows users but

806
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:53,849
we have to come grab binaries and that's

807
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,970
it

808
00:47:53,849 --> 00:48:03,329
any questions and this is Jason and I

809
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:04,618
just wanted to give one of my my tips

810
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:06,089
and tricks with a mess can you go back

811
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,859
to one of the slides with the table that

812
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:14,540
that represents where some of the

813
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:16,890
subdomains were found from the big

814
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:23,609
operation yeah from the enumeration yeah

815
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:25,890
but anyway there you go so for those of

816
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:28,529
you doing bounty hunting when you finish

817
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:30,750
a run of the enumeration what it does is

818
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:33,810
from all the sources a mess goes out to

819
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:35,460
it will categories them in the bottom at

820
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:37,570
the end of the run in a table and it

821
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:41,260
says like X names discovered from

822
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:43,540
whatever sources and I use this cable a

823
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:46,120
lot because when I'm a bounty hunter and

824
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:49,000
I get an open field program I will run

825
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,740
you know that open scope program like

826
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,630
you know Tesla or whatever through a

827
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,399
mash and it'll return all these results

828
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,780
that are from the sources and then when

829
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,190
it breaks it down like this I

830
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:02,890
automatically find the ASN usually for

831
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:05,260
the company that I really didn't go out

832
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:07,390
and grab before and then I also start

833
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:09,580
getting a feel for how they segregate

834
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:10,990
their cloud traffic right with where you

835
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,250
know it's are they an Amazon shop are

836
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:15,100
they an azure shop or something like

837
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:17,230
that how many hosts did I find from just

838
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:20,770
the scraping and the enumeration on the

839
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:23,320
internet and what afn those are in as

840
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:25,270
well so what I do when I get this cable

841
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,310
is I just look at the names here and I'm

842
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:30,790
like okay well let's say that this

843
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:33,400
screen is a wash and let's pretend that

844
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,730
they actually had their own AF and I

845
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:39,430
will use I usually use the net domains

846
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:41,410
command and I will use the you know now

847
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:47,350
it's I think what is the command Fernet

848
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:50,339
domains now Intel math Intel yeah so I

849
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:56,040
would probably use not a mess itself now

850
00:49:50,340 --> 00:50:01,360
to to basically skin the whole range for

851
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:05,259
sites that are that are 4 for 3 and that

852
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:06,670
will come back with or for 43 and 8080 I

853
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,430
think at the default and what that'll do

854
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:12,340
is we'll go to everything in the ASN

855
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:15,009
range 400 for Tesla or something like

856
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,170
that and it will bring back other

857
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:20,200
top-level domains for which I can then

858
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:23,380
run the tool over again using the enum

859
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:26,220
option and find a whole new set of

860
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:29,020
street domains and so a mash is really

861
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:31,899
it really feeds into me finding not only

862
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:34,930
subdomains but regular like top Dylan is

863
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,790
it it lets me discover new brands and

864
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:38,770
then the the final iteration of how I

865
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:41,560
use any mash and in this section is when

866
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:43,870
I find a cloud or when I find that a an

867
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:47,080
organization is primarily a cloud hosted

868
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:50,859
organization I'll scan the whole damn

869
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:54,400
AWS range for the key

870
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:57,670
word of of the you know the target I'm

871
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:01,090
after right to try to see and I'll use

872
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:03,100
that with Intel to try to see if I can

873
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:04,900
find cloud hosted domains but maybe

874
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:08,170
works greater than anywhere but now I

875
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:10,540
get back via the the Intel play so the

876
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:12,340
summary table out of I mean not just

877
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:15,009
like finding the subdomains until a the

878
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:16,780
summary table that enum gives in net

879
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:20,770
domains which is now Intel or actually

880
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:23,170
two of my favorite pieces of of usage on

881
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:28,030
on a mash so thank you guys for making

882
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:29,530
it it really helps me so yeah yeah

883
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:33,520
thanks for the comments those really

884
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:35,950
insightful just a quick note about the

885
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,870
summary table to if you have another

886
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:42,520
tool or if you want to like pipe this

887
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:44,529
tool into something else you just want

888
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,500
to grab the discovered domain the

889
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:49,000
discovered domain our output on standard

890
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,150
out and everything else is on standard

891
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,760
air so you don't have to worry about you

892
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:57,010
know handling all the extra nonsense I

893
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:03,730
you can just grab from standard now what

894
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:06,450
you wanna zoom it that way any other

895
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,450
questions

896
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:11,860
we've had a few I think Jefferson in

897
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:14,290
there kind of answering them via text

898
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:16,450
well while we were running yeah just was

899
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:19,720
pretty active in the chat in the YouTube

900
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:22,180
chat yeah let me let me scroll back and

901
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:25,870
look through yeah the the question I

902
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:28,060
asked was early on and I think most

903
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,420
people thought the chat was that when

904
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:33,759
you're doing the brute force section

905
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:36,070
does the tool break it across multiple

906
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,720
domain resolvers like mash DNS does

907
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,980
which is you know kind of the one for

908
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,419
one of the first tools to do that and I

909
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,420
think the answer is yes correct

910
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:51,729
yeah so all of the resolution goes

911
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:54,130
through the resolver engine which I

912
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:59,250
guess that earlier spreads it out across

913
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:59,250
the resolvers yes configured perfect

914
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:07,869
all right if I for folks that are

915
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,400
watching on the stream Casey just asked

916
00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:11,680
in the chat if anyone has any questions

917
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:17,650
if anyone has any questions we've got

918
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:19,779
about five more minutes until we're

919
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:22,390
gonna go on to our or start setting up

920
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:25,750
our next talk so we've got a few more

921
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:27,490
minutes with the with the team so make

922
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:32,230
sure to ask questions we just had a

923
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:33,819
questions what is BB AC where a lot of

924
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:47,230
people are using that acronym in chat

925
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:50,619
right now so what is be BAC not so

926
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:53,680
that's a different question and I don't

927
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:56,099
know what that is then is this where I

928
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:59,500
realize like I'm old and out of touch

929
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:01,450
let's see it's there's no more questions

930
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,030
one of the questions was I think this is

931
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:05,618
actually you know of a handful of

932
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:09,490
presentations that you two have done is

933
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:11,740
one of the only ones that'll probably be

934
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:12,879
on video I think so people are asking

935
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:16,770
that there's like a lot of config

936
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:19,119
options in here and there's a lot of

937
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:22,540
like a lot to go on with each of the

938
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:25,390
tools is there going to be like is there

939
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,589
a wiki associated to the project and a

940
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:31,240
lot of people are interested in

941
00:54:26,589 --> 00:54:34,509
contributing and stuff like that yeah we

942
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:40,359
have a whole kind of wiki we have a user

943
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:43,180
guide on a github yeah I think you can

944
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:44,770
like pull requests if you want to it's

945
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,970
like people want to contribute their own

946
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:50,589
changes but we're really trying to

947
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:53,140
bolster our documentation especially

948
00:54:50,589 --> 00:54:54,430
with this new release because it's

949
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,500
certainly one of our weak points

950
00:54:54,430 --> 00:55:02,919
especially now that our future says run

951
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:07,750
so much you just got one oops my mics

952
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:10,270
there we go our user is able to add

953
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:13,140
additional resolver slash custom

954
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:13,140
resolvers

955
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:18,820
yes under the resolver section in the

956
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:24,110
config file all right the resolver says

957
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:28,550
config file that I think you can do it

958
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:31,850
on the command line too and the new

959
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:37,220
version is coming is out today now or

960
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:39,860
when's it coming out I think we're gonna

961
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,540
push it today or tomorrow I mean isn't

962
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:43,940
currently in the develop branch so

963
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:47,600
people wanna know if they can't wait

964
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:50,930
they can build from develop branch we're

965
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:53,690
gonna push it earlier today or tomorrow

966
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:55,549
do like a virtual Oprah where you ask

967
00:55:53,690 --> 00:56:00,830
everyone to look under their seats and

968
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:03,350
there's the new version of OS IMS we've

969
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:06,799
got a separate question so I got it

970
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:10,940
actually through discord so is a mash

971
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:13,040
scope gonna stay on discovering kind of

972
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:15,230
domains and subdomains or you guys ever

973
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,570
thinking about extending it to find

974
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:20,060
virtual hosts because a lot of new tools

975
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:22,310
have been coming up to brute force and

976
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:30,790
find virtual house for same IP addresses

977
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:36,320
or we are willing to expand the

978
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:38,810
objectives of this project as long as it

979
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:42,440
seems to be meeting the needs of the

980
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:47,360
same audience if that answers the

981
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:51,470
question oh yeah I mean right I think so

982
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:53,570
yeah absolutely I think I think that you

983
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:55,399
have a few separate audiences here right

984
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:58,040
like red teams and and everybody like

985
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,530
that and then you have bug hunters and I

986
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,210
think one of the core things that we're

987
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:04,310
seeing on a lot of hosts is that like

988
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:06,890
you know people host a lot of web

989
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:08,480
servers on same host and you know part

990
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:10,970
of the the challenges that you're only

991
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,130
scraping one virtual host where is

992
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:15,169
there's you know actually many host it

993
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:18,250
and there are some tools available for

994
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:21,020
that but none of them are I would say

995
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,950
optimized as a mash so could be

996
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,160
something to think about in the future

997
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:26,629
but yeah yeah I guess that may be

998
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,310
another way to say it

999
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:32,140
what I'd like to leave everyone with us

1000
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:35,330
as long as it meets the goals for

1001
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:37,609
understanding accompanies or an

1002
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:39,049
organization's internet exposure or we

1003
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:41,630
could just say a targets internet

1004
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:48,440
exposure then I would say it's within

1005
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:50,330
scope of the project cool all right I

1006
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,120
think I think we're good Thank You Jonas
