1
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:13,879
now you're up

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:16,250
the stream so let's see we can give you

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,850
an intro fill if you haven't if you're

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,930
not already familiar with Phil Philip is

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,419
a member of the bugcrowd ambassador team

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:29,240
he's been a really great advocate for

7
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:32,240
bugcrowd but also for the info ii hacker

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,329
community he's done a lot to give back

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,700
to his local community where he lives

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:41,060
and we are really excited to have him

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,789
here today to talk about penetration

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,920
testing and then hopefully give people

13
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:48,949
some good tips and tricks and techniques

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,109
and and words of wisdom on how to get

15
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:54,289
into the penetration testing space so

16
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:57,379
that you can do it on the side or even

17
00:00:54,289 --> 00:01:00,320
something like the bugcrowd ng BT

18
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:03,710
testing which is basically a penetration

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,680
test that we work with our crowd with so

20
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,540
yeah Philip thank you so much for

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,000
joining us today and I'm excited for

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,159
your talk take it away I think Sam

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,740
thanks thanks for the introduction and

24
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,780
this is an honor this has been a goal of

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,670
mine since level up one to eventually be

26
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,409
able to present here and I've learned a

27
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,659
lot of good information along the way

28
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,430
this is how I found out about the

29
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:28,970
Ambassador Program last year through

30
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,579
through level up to and so this has been

31
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,979
one my goals so it's awesome to be doing

32
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:40,130
this today and thanks for the

33
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:41,750
opportunity so to get started Sam kind

34
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,479
of gave you a little overview of a

35
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,790
little more detail on my background I'm

36
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,460
a pen tester is my day job I'm an

37
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,469
adjunct instructor at Richland College

38
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,990
I teach ethical hacking web application

39
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:57,079
pin testing this past January made a

40
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:59,839
year that I've been teaching and for for

41
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,579
a long time I've kind of mentored people

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
and helped people that were interested

43
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:07,158
in becoming pen testers or other areas

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,140
of security so so sharing on people in

45
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,900
teaching was something that was a

46
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,820
passion of mine and teaching was just a

47
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,340
further way to enhance that to do it on

48
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:20,359
a broader scale and then becoming an

49
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,340
ambassador this played into this meet up

50
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,680
but I started here locally in the Dallas

51
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,480
area called the palm school project it's

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,750
a monthly meetup that's educational

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,060
teaching

54
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,160
penetration testing techniques and

55
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,170
ethical hacking and there's a lot of

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,570
other we're lucky to hear Dallas to have

57
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,390
like Dallas hackers Association and a

58
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,329
local Def Con group that we have so much

59
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,739
here locally that we're lucky but one of

60
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,840
the things the other ones the other

61
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,970
groups were doing that do presentations

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,830
on certain techniques but it didn't

63
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,470
really go into details so people that

64
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,120
renew you know was that have to go home

65
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,550
do a lot of studying to try to figure

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,790
out what was being said so I saw the

67
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,220
need for my students competing my class

68
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,679
completing my class to continue on in

69
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,359
their education and then people locally

70
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,370
that just maybe couldn't afford the

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,540
training as a way to offer training to

72
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,700
them so that's how the pone school

73
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,280
project was started and be an ambassador

74
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,049
just played into that because being an

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,740
ambassador you give back to the

76
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,330
community you teach others and one of

77
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,340
the goals that I have is trying to teach

78
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,260
people to be researchers so this played

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,470
in my to the grand scheme of things that

80
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:32,700
I was doing so this played in well I've

81
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,680
been in InfoSec NIT for over 21 years 15

82
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,339
plus of it's been security alone I

83
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,660
started out as a system administrator

84
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,550
spent eight years doing network security

85
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,650
and application security application

86
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,620
security is where I got interested in

87
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,880
pen testing so the over the past seven

88
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,070
years that's what I've been doing is pen

89
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,320
testing I finally found the job and I

90
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,799
really enjoy a lot of their positions

91
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,269
even as security and IT after a while

92
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,600
you kind of got bored and it wasn't as

93
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,890
interesting but pen testing has remained

94
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,980
just as interesting as it was when I

95
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,260
started it kind of to give you a little

96
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,940
more about my background the scenic

97
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,700
route I guess you could say my nonlinear

98
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:17,339
path InfoSec is before I ever got into

99
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:19,409
IT I start out as a pro-wrestler wasn't

100
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,060
a really good lifestyle after getting

101
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,580
married I needed something where I had

102
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,890
travel as much stable income somewhat to

103
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,570
school to be a CAD draftsman and then

104
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,580
from being a CAD draftsman I learned

105
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,740
about sysadmin work which was a lot more

106
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,390
interesting to me I found out if they go

107
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,880
into CAD school that I had more of a

108
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,490
niche for for technology so that led me

109
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,469
to be an assist admin then an InfoSec

110
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,180
and then eventually become to pen tester

111
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,830
and during my pro wrestling career

112
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,660
actually one time I did wrestle a bear

113
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,469
so there's a couple pictures up from my

114
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,310
old pro wrestling days back then when I

115
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,570
was getting started

116
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,160
I would never would have never known

117
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,650
that I'd be using my brain for a living

118
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,750
because I was always into powerlifting

119
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,109
and you know did the wrestling thing and

120
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,910
thought whatever I would do would be

121
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,370
just physically based but after getting

122
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:10,350
a little education I learned that that

123
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:12,240
uh technology was a lot more fun and so

124
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,100
we're gonna discuss today we're gonna

125
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,340
describe pentesting the types of pin

126
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,040
tests specialization skills for other

127
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,539
roles needs to be a pen tester the

128
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,730
things you need to learn to be a pen

129
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,290
tester learning resources how to get

130
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:28,280
experience in certifications that are

131
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,540
helpful in being a penetration tester

132
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,489
and this is one of the slides I shared

133
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,290
my student each semester and I want to

134
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,880
share this message to anyone that that

135
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,600
may be new to pen testing you have to go

136
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,640
hacking or security research I got this

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,250
quote from from one of the spider-man

138
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,630
movies when Uncle Ben was telling Peter

139
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,010
that you know with great power comes

140
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,690
great responsibility

141
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,640
so you want to remember this whenever

142
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,950
anytime you're hacking make sure you got

143
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,750
permission without permission it's

144
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,780
illegal and better off you want reading

145
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,000
written permission proof that you have

146
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,919
the permission to do that and either you

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,510
do you go through some company to do pen

148
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,919
testing or you go through like bugcrowd

149
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,020
and doing bug bounties that way you've

150
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,820
got permission to do it you know you can

151
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,650
run into some problems when you get

152
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,460
someone as hey can you test this system

153
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,549
it's mine

154
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,840
and it could be someone else's system or

155
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,370
someone's trying to get you to illegally

156
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,260
breach a system so you definitely want

157
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,610
to be careful with this and with a

158
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,530
felony on your record it would make it

159
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,320
really hard to get get jobs as a pen

160
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:29,400
tester or in security at all so keep

161
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,440
that in mind and what is pen testing so

162
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,450
pen testing is assessing security from

163
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,010
the adversarial perspective exploiting

164
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,050
vulnerabilities gained access to systems

165
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,480
and since the data basically hacking

166
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,130
that's why I'm more commonly hear the

167
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,560
term for a pen testers ethical hacking

168
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,360
this is more a better way to describe

169
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,780
penetration testing can be kind of a

170
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,340
confusing term so any time I tell people

171
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,900
that aren't in industry what I do for a

172
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,549
living I tell them I'm an ethical hacker

173
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,378
and make

174
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,729
it makes a lot more sense to them than

175
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:00,410
then penetration tester wipe in testing

176
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:02,240
well pen testing gives you a better

177
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,509
understanding of the scary is the risk

178
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,400
severity of security risks if you've

179
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,800
exploitable vulnerabilities or higher

180
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,979
risk it higher priority for mediation

181
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,139
than and justification for budgeting so

182
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:17,419
low level finding may not be that high

183
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,280
risk so this kind of if it's exploitable

184
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:22,400
then it's a higher risk and this is a

185
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,500
good way to show that these items or

186
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,770
exploit offal exploitable and it's

187
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,849
easier to get budget to remediate items

188
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,979
when you can prove that they can

189
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:33,139
actually be exploited because sometimes

190
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,460
there's some low level or informational

191
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,259
findings that you may not be able to

192
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,090
exploit they're not that risky but if

193
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:41,289
you can prove that they're exploitable

194
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:44,179
that's a good way to get the budget to

195
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:47,060
to remediate those and plus just from

196
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,469
from testing this way testing security

197
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,210
you're able to find things you wouldn't

198
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,949
find with just a typical vulnerability

199
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,719
scan you're able to dig further past

200
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,180
that vulnerability and see what else can

201
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:58,759
be done what other Gumm abilities lie in

202
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,229
that system behind the firewall the

203
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,800
antivirus and other endpoint protection

204
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:05,719
on it and regulatory compliance this is

205
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,360
a big thing that drives a lot of pen

206
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:10,610
tests at our company a lot of our tests

207
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,969
are based on PCI so this is where we do

208
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,319
most of our work for PCI plus another

209
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:17,990
thing about pen testing it's a fun job

210
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:21,469
with a lot of great opportunities used

211
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,479
to in the past the only job you really

212
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,370
seen out there were contractors or

213
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,800
consultants most companies didn't have

214
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,240
their own internal pen testers but

215
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,680
that's kind of changing what the times

216
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,260
people are starting to add their own

217
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,839
internal pen testers because it can be

218
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,078
expensive in some cases to use only oli

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,760
consultants or contractors and a lot of

220
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:42,140
companies like our company is there's

221
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,779
numerous companies that have big

222
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,640
penetration testing teams and companies

223
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:51,620
are adding pen test teams as time goes

224
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,640
by pen testing jobs you know most

225
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,230
commonly some of these when you're

226
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,029
looking for a job you'll see some of the

227
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,950
titles as penetration testers or pen

228
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,570
testers but more commonly you'll see

229
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,000
something like security consultant

230
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,310
analyst or engineers you really have to

231
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,120
dig into the job descriptions to find

232
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,469
out if it's you know

233
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,529
an actual pentesting job sometimes

234
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,350
because typically you'll see like

235
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:15,120
analyst or engineer some other word

236
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,790
synonymous with pen testing as ethical

237
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,800
hacking offensive security adversarial

238
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,050
security and these a lot of times will

239
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,390
fall under groups known as threat and

240
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,490
vulnerability management so when you're

241
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,240
looking for a job just kind of keep you

242
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,100
know like the threat and vulnerability

243
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,170
management several companies I work for

244
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:35,670
that was the title of our pen test team

245
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,699
in pen testing skills that are valuable

246
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,349
in other areas sake analysts the

247
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,450
understanding malicious traffic can help

248
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,830
you as a stock analyst digital forensics

249
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,200
and Incident Response if you're

250
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,850
responding to an incident if you

251
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,070
understand the attack vectors then

252
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,540
you're going to be able to you it's

253
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,490
gonna make your life easier you're gonna

254
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,040
it's gonna give you an edge figuring out

255
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,230
how how things were how these breaches

256
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,660
occurred network security analyst and

257
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,640
engineers this is value of them purple

258
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,339
team's where you're doing both defensive

259
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,380
and offensive applications security it's

260
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,970
really good note that area as well so

261
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,100
you can do some of your testing you may

262
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,100
not necessarily be doing the pen test

263
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,720
but be able to perform some kind of some

264
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,700
kind of assessment security assessment

265
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,910
of the software is kind of it's good to

266
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,610
have in security researchers as we know

267
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,949
as bug hunters this is a good area to

268
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,480
have pen testing skills a lot of good

269
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,110
bug hunters come from pen testing

270
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,610
backgrounds for instance Jason Haddix he

271
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,529
comes from a pen testing background so

272
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,720
you may be a bug hunter but it doesn't

273
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,970
hurt to expand past the application

274
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,740
layer to understand the network layer

275
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,560
and some of the other areas that can be

276
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:47,700
exploited in types of pen test targets

277
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,890
so these are the items that you would

278
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,480
normally test and some of the most

279
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,209
common ones common ones are listed here

280
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,140
first network your internal external and

281
00:10:54,209 --> 00:11:00,839
wireless networks application web app

282
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,699
that client mobile and cloud and then

283
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,500
your hardware hacking network hardware

284
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,600
routers and switches and even down to

285
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,900
some of the more newer technologies like

286
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,190
IMT and medical devices you know medical

287
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,410
devices you want to make sure that these

288
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,820
are secure

289
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,680
leave the devices are secure at least on

290
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,050
a secure network to prevent someone from

291
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,260
having access to pacemakers or insulin

292
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:24,449
I have done wireless pen tests for

293
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,310
hospitals before and it's interesting to

294
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,440
see all the wireless is connected

295
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,719
wirelessly to their their Wi-Fi network

296
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,490
in transportation this is where your car

297
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,080
hacking comes in handy all tort all

298
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,140
types of vehicles

299
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,000
you know buses planes cars with the

300
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,670
autonomous autonomous self-driving

301
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,290
vehicles coming out this is you know

302
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,630
becoming a lot more serious area that

303
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,719
they need to make sure that these these

304
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,720
cars or buses accept or whatever vehicle

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,600
is secure so this is a popular area I

306
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,780
even saw that there is a college in

307
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,110
Texas that were proposing a vehicle

308
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:03,000
pentesting course or degree part of

309
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,790
their security program so this is

310
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,980
starting to get to be well more visible

311
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,709
area that people are realizing the need

312
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,090
for security people social engineering

313
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,840
so you're actually trying to hack the

314
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,090
human element

315
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,810
sometimes your endpoint protections your

316
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:21,090
firewalls all this other security may

317
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,770
prevent you from actually breaching the

318
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,440
network but if you can get someone to

319
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:28,230
click on a file or let you in a door

320
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,090
then there's possibilities to hack into

321
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:34,400
those ways so that's one of the targets

322
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:36,990
that pentesters red teamers will try to

323
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,480
hack buildings your physical security

324
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:43,020
this is very important you can have the

325
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,550
most sophisticated security everything

326
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,660
can be locked down great but if

327
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,579
someone's able to get in the door and

328
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,620
get physical access all bets are off so

329
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,960
this is one of the areas is good and

330
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:57,480
it's usually typically done within a

331
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:59,370
social engineering engagement types of

332
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,830
pentest knowledge this is the knowledge

333
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,650
of your target your testing so as a pen

334
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,900
tester the first one we're going to look

335
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,270
at is black box this means like limited

336
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,630
to maybe IP addresses at the most and

337
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,130
it's more of an attacker approach and

338
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:17,280
this requires a little more time than

339
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,750
like the white box your white box also

340
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,990
known as crystal box it's detailed

341
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,520
system info including accounts for apps

342
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:27,240
testing documentation is can be Visio

343
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,490
diagrams more information a lot of fan

344
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,080
testers think that this is not this

345
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,089
is kind of cheating a white box pin test

346
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,490
that when you have a little little time

347
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:37,620
to test then you want to be able to test

348
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,060
all the controls and a lot of this

349
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,950
requires be able to access the

350
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,800
application as a user and even

351
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,200
administrator when I test applications I

352
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,500
like to have multi levels I like to have

353
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,320
administrator and other roles that may

354
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,610
be of users are on that system so that

355
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,010
way you can make sure that they can't

356
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,570
get to information that they should get

357
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,069
to even administrators there's some

358
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,380
information that they shouldn't see they

359
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,540
shouldn't see full unmasked account

360
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,980
numbers and social security numbers and

361
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,779
you also want to test the CV can

362
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,029
escalate privileges so if a lot of a

363
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,399
user can get to admin and so forth

364
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:13,890
access information they shouldn't and

365
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,180
then the next level is gray box this is

366
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,209
kind of a little more common what you

367
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,459
see partial knowledge of target this is

368
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:23,790
kind of a cross between black box and

369
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:26,369
white box testing you'll get usually in

370
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,020
this you get more you know IPS you know

371
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,330
URLs and that stuff and not necessarily

372
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,910
accounts a little more information then

373
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,459
black box but not the full extent white

374
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,290
box but all these different types of

375
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:40,050
testing are important and a lot of these

376
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,430
are dictated by the amount of time you

377
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,459
have for the pen test if you've got a

378
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:49,520
week on an application you're gonna be a

379
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:52,829
lot better off to a white box test and

380
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,480
compared that to a malicious actor or

381
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:57,300
malicious actors have all the time in

382
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,529
the world so that's one of the things

383
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,109
that a pen tester runs into the

384
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:03,450
limitations of time and the types of

385
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,190
tests testing depth isn't going to kind

386
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,740
of give you the different levels of

387
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,450
what's required in a test and some of

388
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,529
those are standalone functions in the

389
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,899
threat and vulnerability management

390
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:14,520
program first we look at your

391
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,040
vulnerability scans this is your necess

392
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,689
your next pose your Qualis your scan

393
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:24,630
against these items and then for

394
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:26,430
application web inspect or app scan net

395
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,990
spark or some of these other types of

396
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,180
vulnerability scanners you're just

397
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,709
looking for vulnerabilities with this so

398
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,349
this is not giving you the level of

399
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:36,329
depth as a pen test but this is just

400
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,770
scanning for vulnerabilities looking for

401
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:40,260
your low-hanging fruit and this could be

402
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,260
dedicated groups and a company that do

403
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,080
reoccurring scanning in your next

404
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,700
is your vulnerability assessments a lot

405
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,560
of times as a pen tester you may start

406
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,870
out doing vulnerability assessments and

407
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,239
a vulnerability assessment is basically

408
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,610
the vulnerability scan plus validation

409
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,230
you're validating the findings you're

410
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,510
making sure there's no false positives

411
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,950
there's somebody it's little this kind

412
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,510
of simplifies it there's more things to

413
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,040
it when you're validating those

414
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:08,069
vulnerabilities you can use other tools

415
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,390
outside of the vulnerability scanner but

416
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,550
this is the next level of the process

417
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,830
and then from the vulnerability

418
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,229
assessment comes a pen test these are

419
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,140
taking these other two areas plus you're

420
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,700
adding exploitation so your the the

421
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,199
vulnerability is that you were able to

422
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,870
validate now you're gonna try to see if

423
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,520
you're going to exploit it them and

424
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,480
exploitation and common terms hacking so

425
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,530
you're gonna try to see if you can hack

426
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,380
into those systems through those

427
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:34,500
exploits and then you have red teaming

428
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,150
and adversarial tests people have been

429
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,250
in most people been in the industry for

430
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,600
a while will have a different view of

431
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,900
red team a lot of times this looked at

432
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,420
generically as the red team is offensive

433
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,880
blue team is defensive but in the field

434
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,400
red teaming is more of adversarial

435
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,580
simulation so this is a step above pen

436
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,680
testing and one of the best definitions

437
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,020
I heard of that is wire fall from Dallas

438
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,229
hackers referred to this as testing the

439
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,360
blue team you're testing the controls

440
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,370
you're testing the staff you're seeing

441
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,950
how they react most times and Red Team

442
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:10,409
Red Team your adversarial simulations

443
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,730
they don't let the security people know

444
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,920
this is going on so that way they can

445
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,290
test their reactions make sure the

446
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,690
things they have in place to protect the

447
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,369
network are working properly and then

448
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,580
the people that are watching these items

449
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,569
and monitoring network or CMEs and

450
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:29,520
blocking or be able to at least identify

451
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:32,340
these attacks and this is the part most

452
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,410
people want to hear I like to cover up

453
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,699
front about pen testing so you can

454
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,590
understand these other items why you

455
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,210
need to know that so this is where is

456
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,750
that usually what people like about this

457
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,790
talk or that when I give talks about

458
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,230
becoming a pen tester in this talk I

459
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,540
didn't mentioned first is kind of an

460
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:51,240
evolution of the talk I do the first day

461
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,860
of class for my students my first day of

462
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,160
the ethical hacking class telling them

463
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,070
about you know gun testing and what's

464
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,029
required to become a pen

465
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:03,399
tester and so technological knowledge

466
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:04,990
you have to understand technology you

467
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:07,090
have to understand something before you

468
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,250
can protect it or before you can hack

469
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,559
into it so you need to understand

470
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:14,559
networking operating systems especially

471
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:16,120
Windows and Linux and security so you

472
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,080
need to understand security understand

473
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,719
firewalls how firewall rules work file

474
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,178
systems how your file permissions work

475
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,309
and then also application understanding

476
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:29,440
some applications security if you're

477
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:31,178
just a generalist or pen tester that's

478
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,610
not specializing in application security

479
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,259
you still need to understand web

480
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,350
applications a little bit understand

481
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:41,230
word about the applications security and

482
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:44,789
how those function and then hardware so

483
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,990
understanding how servers work and

484
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:49,210
workstations and so forth understanding

485
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,559
computing in general so these are the

486
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:55,809
things you really need to understand

487
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:58,779
going into this and to kind of add on to

488
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:00,940
that when I started my first pen testing

489
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:02,559
job my manager at the company that

490
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,960
worked at which wasn't kind of

491
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,168
consulting he always encourages to build

492
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,639
something he wasn't really pushing us to

493
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,350
learn how to hack he said you know if

494
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:16,959
you learned how to build it then you can

495
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:18,340
learn how to break into it so the next

496
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,590
thing you need to once you understand

497
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,449
those other technologies to be a pen

498
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,279
tester you need to understand how to

499
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:27,990
hack and so you can give this through

500
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:30,340
classes conferences meetups and

501
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,919
self-study is the route most people take

502
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,330
even if you get to go these classes or

503
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,399
conferences and stuff then you still

504
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,889
need to do some study on your own being

505
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:41,080
a pen tester or in a lot of areas of

506
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:45,490
security alone it's not not a really

507
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,769
easy job to it's if you don't go in you

508
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,679
know if you're gonna succeed you don't

509
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:54,340
go in with the mindset that I'm gonna

510
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:56,169
work 9 to 5 and that's it and and you

511
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,939
don't want that this mindset if I'm only

512
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:59,529
going to get training when the company's

513
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,419
paying for it if you want to get ahead

514
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,340
you've got to study on your own the

515
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:04,269
people that get ahead you'll take people

516
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,490
that have been in the industry a long

517
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:08,110
time that's the nine-to-fiver that I'm

518
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,940
not gonna study unless the company sends

519
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,290
me for training they'll get passed up by

520
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,420
the

521
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,980
you people so just to stay up with

522
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,380
technology this is something you need to

523
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,300
spend some time on your own outside work

524
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,370
studying and if you're trying to move

525
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,860
over from another area you know if

526
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,020
you're doing you know web development

527
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:28,860
somewhere they may not let you spend the

528
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,720
time studying you know pen testing so

529
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,429
any rate these are the different

530
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,800
different areas you can learner that and

531
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,540
far as the self study home labs are very

532
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,810
valuable this is one of the best ways I

533
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:42,570
learned better hands-on videos different

534
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:44,010
tutorials blogs and articles Twitter's a

535
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,139
real good resource that's where I get

536
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:49,410
most of my information and Twitter's how

537
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:52,110
I found out about bug hunters that's one

538
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,000
of the reasons I was drawn to bugcrowd

539
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,610
was just finding some of these

540
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,350
researchers and bug hunters like Jason

541
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,149
and some of these other guys that really

542
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,770
taught bug hunters I've learned some

543
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,720
interesting web application pen testing

544
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,550
stuff for them so that's who I follow I

545
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,470
get most of my information from Twitter

546
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,930
a lot of people put up tweets maybe

547
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,990
they've got some tool that's coming out

548
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,510
that hasn't been you know mentioning an

549
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,770
article yet that hasn't really been

550
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:19,140
fully released to the public so this is

551
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:23,190
a good way to get in and find out this

552
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:25,230
stuff early on and so the hacker mindset

553
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,550
is something that you need the hacker

554
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,370
mindset it's pretty interesting because

555
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:32,610
being a pen tester being a hacker being

556
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,080
you know a security researcher the one

557
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,780
area the one thing about this part of

558
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:41,070
security is it takes creativity so it's

559
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:43,320
kind of a combination of creativity and

560
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,030
analytical thinking and so this has

561
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,649
developed it's similar is similar

562
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,750
developing the mindset of

563
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,940
troubleshooting because when you first

564
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,860
go in somewhere like my one my first

565
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,100
test admin jobs all I was doing was

566
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,870
installs we were rolling out servers so

567
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,490
there wasn't a lot of troubleshooting so

568
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,949
I had extensive research and then my

569
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,010
next job we I was an environment that's

570
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,870
very unstable systems were overloaded

571
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,240
not configured right constantly breaking

572
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,100
and I was really overwhelmed putting a

573
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,620
lot of hours and I was close to quitting

574
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,500
the job but then I stopped thought I got

575
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,360
all this experience installing but where

576
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,910
I'm really lacking is I'm really lacking

577
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,370
experience with troubleshooting so I

578
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,020
stuck it out so the same thing with

579
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,370
hacking

580
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,170
you kind of go in and like

581
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,459
troubleshooting if you know you're not

582
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,320
connecting make sure the cable is

583
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,820
plugged in make sure that you know

584
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,100
you've got your network card configured

585
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,470
right so these little details as you

586
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,510
practice hacking then you kind of it

587
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:42,980
becomes second nature so you know if you

588
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,510
see a unprotected upload that maybe you

589
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,040
can upload a war file and create a

590
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:49,520
malicious JSP page on

591
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,379
Pachi Tomcat server so as you learn

592
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,059
these things you know how to hack one

593
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,980
thing that you can build upon that and

594
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:57,920
this is best developed through

595
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,260
repetition and hands on hacking

596
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:06,470
experience that's something you would

597
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:08,450
get through labs or bug bounties and the

598
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,910
formula for becoming a pen tester is

599
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,530
technology technology knowledge plus

600
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,020
security knowledge plus the hacker

601
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:19,550
mindset these are the three items needed

602
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:23,179
to be a pen tester and where do you

603
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:24,500
start so you start off by developing

604
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:27,500
your plan you want to assess your

605
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,090
current skillset forgotten look at all

606
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,309
the things that you know so far and

607
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,780
perform a gap analysis on the skills

608
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,610
needed look at the things you need to

609
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,530
learn like we discussed you need to

610
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:39,919
understand networking you need to

611
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,300
understand operating systems so you look

612
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,190
at these items and find out where your

613
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,940
weaknesses are and that's what you need

614
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,890
to focus your your learning towards in

615
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,090
developing this plan we're like we were

616
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,600
looking for the gaps now it's time to

617
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:55,309
fill the gaps if you have no idea

618
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,678
start with the basics operating systems

619
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:00,800
hardware and networking think you know

620
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,990
A+ certification progressing towards

621
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,899
like network plus and then if you have

622
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:08,030
IT experience then you need to learn

623
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,280
Linux and security and networking if

624
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,420
you're you're rolling and IT you may

625
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,879
know networking but these are some

626
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,740
common areas that that most people need

627
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,170
to look at and if you have InfoSec

628
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,000
experience builds gaps in basics that

629
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,070
you're missing with pen testing and

630
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,470
ethical hacking participates ETFs and

631
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,389
bug bounties and your labs and it this

632
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,340
goes for the the bottom step everyone

633
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,920
built a lab everyone you know some of

634
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,409
the most experienced hackers I know have

635
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,309
labs and they've been pen testing for

636
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,440
like 20 years

637
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:37,520
so it's you can always learn and when

638
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,100
you have a lab you can only

639
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,110
test the proof-of-concept that you may

640
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,360
try to use on a bug bounty or maybe

641
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,370
you're doing a pen test so if you have

642
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,530
this lab you can test these exploits

643
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,149
because you're not always gonna run to

644
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,770
these exploits in the wild so if you

645
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,600
have a lab you can build a lab put in

646
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:57,680
these multiple apps and test these you

647
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,929
know the latest exploits and get

648
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,810
experience CTFs there's a lot of online

649
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:05,270
CTFs you know to conferences or other

650
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:08,030
events like our meetup Dallas hackers

651
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,580
Association we have a CTF each month bug

652
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:12,080
bounties are a great place and the thing

653
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,300
I really like about bug bounty programs

654
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,520
it's an actual production environment so

655
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,659
you're actually getting production

656
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,580
experience when you go in and do an

657
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,680
interview with an employer and they ask

658
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,120
you how you do you know ask you about

659
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,310
cross-site scripting or sequel injection

660
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,860
you're able to describe these and tell

661
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:30,139
them how you were able to exploit those

662
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,610
in a bug bounty so once you get this

663
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,980
experience this is actual real world

664
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:37,219
you're doing you know this in the real

665
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:39,290
world a CTF is a simulated environment

666
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,780
it's purposely vulnerable so that may

667
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,909
not as be as helpful but if you're doing

668
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,670
like a bug bounty and you find bugs in

669
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,020
there then it's going to go a lot

670
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,750
further and get it helping you get a pen

671
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,150
test job and pro bono work or volunteer

672
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,740
work do free pet pen tests for nonprofit

673
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,020
organizations or small businesses they

674
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,950
can't afford pen tests so this will

675
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,990
actually give you a real-world

676
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,220
experience and people that you can use

677
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:05,360
as a reference when looking for those

678
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,590
jobs and will mention this probably even

679
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,669
more throughout this talk the labs

680
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,810
personal lab and online labs is a good

681
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,240
way to get experience if you can

682
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,190
describe how to use these tools you know

683
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:23,210
you can use that information on an

684
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:24,950
interview and specializations most

685
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,350
people who start out as a generalist in

686
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,930
the generalist you need at least network

687
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:32,209
wireless and and web app sometimes

688
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:34,670
starting out like when I was starting

689
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,740
out at first I just did network and web

690
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,810
application and moving into wireless but

691
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:43,010
this is more of the generalist role your

692
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:45,290
typical pen tester no it does wireless

693
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,690
network and web app in an application

694
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,490
you can specialize in application so you

695
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,380
can do web app mobile apps they client

696
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,300
and cloud and then

697
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:57,110
where you can specialize I specialize in

698
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,639
IOT network hardware medical devices you

699
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,250
know you can work for some company as a

700
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,130
researcher testing the different

701
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:06,200
hardware devices vehicles your

702
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,870
automobiles trucks multi passenger

703
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,060
vehicles and vans and even aircraft

704
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,439
those some type of specializations and

705
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,389
you're starting to see more of the

706
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,180
vehicle jobs more of the car hacking

707
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:18,500
jobs out there in some of these areas

708
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,470
that you don't see as much people in

709
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,850
this may be a good way to to something

710
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,530
to focus on if you're just getting

711
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,080
started out as well because since

712
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:28,580
there's not as many people in those

713
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,010
areas that maybe there's opportunities

714
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,610
there that may not exist in some of the

715
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,830
other more populated areas although the

716
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,540
security field is understaffed so once

717
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,179
you have the right skills and experience

718
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,840
then it's only a matter of time before

719
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:46,820
you get your foot the door and then your

720
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,199
labs you know we talked about labs so

721
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,649
you're minimalist lab this is just

722
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,250
putting virtualized hosts using vm

723
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:57,530
virtualbox hypervisor whatever

724
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:59,930
virtualization you choose to use on a

725
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,490
desktop or laptop I look like a laptop

726
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,380
because that way you can carry it with

727
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,150
you if you travel you go on vacation you

728
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,640
can still spend a little time in your

729
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,020
lab or if you get bored at home you've

730
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,340
been studying you need to go somewhere

731
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,010
get out of the house go to a coffee shop

732
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,629
maybe study for a bit so that's that's

733
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,879
kind of a nice set up to have there and

734
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:20,450
then your dedicated lab so then you have

735
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,820
like a machine or some raspberry PI's or

736
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:26,000
some small devices that you can set up

737
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,830
with VMs on there that's put learn

738
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,630
multiple VMs and then attack from

739
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,449
another system and then as you get more

740
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:35,120
advanced labs you can get individual

741
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:37,250
computers for servers and routers and

742
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,689
switches so you can break it down but

743
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,830
all the things are the things about

744
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,210
building some of these the more advanced

745
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,500
stuff you'll get a little more

746
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,270
experience learning how to build

747
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,060
networks you know setting up these

748
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,800
applications that are vulnerable they're

749
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,570
the vulnerable VMS are great but in what

750
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,180
way to take a step above that is to

751
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:57,649
download the vulnerable applications and

752
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:59,540
build that out yourself and then your

753
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,360
attack platform you've got your lab set

754
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,700
up so now you need to be able to you

755
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,270
need something to hack with so the most

756
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,010
common one

757
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,860
you're gonna see as kali linux it works

758
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:12,200
it's a pretty good packing distribution

759
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:15,320
has most the tools installed by default

760
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,120
if not it's in the repositories for kali

761
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,419
linux and can be installed fairly easy

762
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,820
and then in bunty with the pentester

763
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,430
framework script from trusted set

764
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,139
security trusted sec it's a little

765
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,030
script that she can run on a bun too and

766
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,160
it will install all the different pen

767
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,850
testing tools if you'd rather run on a

768
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:36,970
bun to you and then peridot s is another

769
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:39,230
linux distribution that's got all the

770
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:41,210
pen testing hacking tools is installed

771
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:44,120
and it's also good to get some

772
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,130
experience with windows when backtrack

773
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,250
came out eventually it was it was the

774
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:52,130
predecessor to kali linux that's where a

775
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,960
lot of people started going that way but

776
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,390
now with all the powershell tools and

777
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,860
and be able to operate hacking tools

778
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,380
natively in a Windows environment it's

779
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,370
good to have a Windows VM or a

780
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,110
standalone Windows system that you can

781
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:06,739
hack with and so you can take like

782
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:09,110
Windows 10 and use fireeyes Commandos vm

783
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:12,590
scripts and the commando vm scripts is

784
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:15,199
similar to if we think about it coming

785
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:18,470
from using the pen tester framework

786
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,960
script is similar that it's automates

787
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:23,210
and installing the different pen testing

788
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,580
tools on Windows 10 so you have all the

789
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:28,430
power shell even Metasploit all that

790
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:32,570
installed on there so this is also a

791
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:34,190
good intern alternative if you don't

792
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,020
have much experience with Windows

793
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,270
administration then you definitely want

794
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,770
to look at this because you know being

795
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,520
able to run PowerShell natively and all

796
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:45,440
these tools is a great option and

797
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:48,590
whatever I was consulting up I had like

798
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,430
a Windows VM on my attack box that I

799
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:55,340
used so I like VMware and Windows 10 I

800
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:58,760
usually use like Ubuntu or Mac OS was my

801
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:03,320
my host OS and then I ran VM those other

802
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,970
tools and we'll have targets so you

803
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,100
create your virtual machines you can get

804
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,020
the targets from vult hub there's a lot

805
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:12,439
of great vulnerable VMs on there some of

806
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,840
them some of them are from CTF that's

807
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,580
been held at conferences too that I

808
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,100
recommend getting start out with - as

809
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:23,000
far as you met your

810
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:25,010
cultural virtual nerble hosts vulnerable

811
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,799
VMs is Metasploit will to the Metasploit

812
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:30,650
Ville 3 those are really good as well as

813
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:32,389
the wasp webgoat you can create your own

814
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:37,610
target VMs download the software from

815
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:39,289
exploit DB so you may not find but VMs

816
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,899
they have particular exploits on there

817
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:45,110
so you may and some of the VM since

818
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,250
there's licensing for Windows it's a

819
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,620
little more difficult to find some

820
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,840
vulnerable windows VM so a lot of cases

821
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,729
you should create your own so by

822
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,049
downloading the software from exploit

823
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,049
Eevee you can build your own that way

824
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:02,210
and recommend a reading so here's the

825
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,730
the books I recommend starting out with

826
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,250
pen testing a hands-on introduction to

827
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:10,549
hacking that book is by Georgia Weidman

828
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:12,320
I've used that book for my first three

829
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:14,960
semesters of my ethical hacking class

830
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:19,250
later on we went to the pen test plus to

831
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,929
give students an option to be able to to

832
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,000
be able to get a certification to study

833
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,650
for a certification and then the next

834
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,010
book I recommend after you get through

835
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:30,020
the penetration testing book is the the

836
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:33,230
hackers playbook version two and three I

837
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,490
would start with two and then you can go

838
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,200
on and move on to three from there

839
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,850
version three gets into a lot more red

840
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,710
teaming so if you're the red teaming

841
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,480
thing interests you then that's a good

842
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:44,150
one to move on to you and web

843
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,679
application hacker's handbook this is

844
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,020
the second edition this is really good

845
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,640
for web application pen testing and I

846
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,129
recommend it for anyone is a pen tester

847
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,650
because sometimes if you're on you're

848
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:56,299
doing a networked pen test and some you

849
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,620
may not be able to get anything but you

850
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:00,049
may find a vulnerable app so

851
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,149
understanding how to do perform some

852
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:04,789
level application pen testing is very

853
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,200
important and then the last book I've

854
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:08,679
listed on here is the Red Team Field

855
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,820
Manual this is a good reference manual

856
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:15,309
it's got a lot of different syntax for

857
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:17,360
Cisco Python scripts Linux and Windows

858
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:19,668
system administration stuff it's a

859
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,979
really small book easy to easy to carry

860
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:23,929
carry around with you and with a lot of

861
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:27,290
good tips that can be helpful to a pen

862
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:29,470
tester even anyone in security or blue

863
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,470
team

864
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:35,110
and then here's some learning resources

865
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,900
that that are pretty good when getting

866
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:40,990
started out the top portion you can see

867
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:44,170
the divide between these two lists the

868
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:46,660
top portion are resources that that cost

869
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:49,660
money obviously so SANS Institute has a

870
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,130
lot of really good courses related to

871
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,090
pen testing in other areas of security

872
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:56,530
and then this kind of as this goes down

873
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:58,510
they kind of get a little less expensive

874
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:02,410
than he learns security that's a good

875
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:04,540
place for for courses online courses

876
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:07,210
they have I've taken their web

877
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,560
application pentesting class when I was

878
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,710
first get involved and what about pen

879
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,960
testing I took their mobile security

880
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,090
assessment and mobile pen testing course

881
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,860
which is really good I've taken that and

882
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:20,320
there's another site virtual hacking

883
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,910
labs if you're interested in the OSC P I

884
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,740
would recommend starting with virtual

885
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:27,730
hacking labs before you sign up for the

886
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:29,799
OSC P virtual hacking labs has like an

887
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,659
Associated class of course with it a

888
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,550
course manual and it shows you how to

889
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:35,770
perform different pen testing steps and

890
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,690
then as you get into the lab the labs

891
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:40,719
pretty nice they're fairly fairly new

892
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:42,520
systems in there and even like mobile

893
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,969
devices so this is a really good place

894
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,800
to start out with and also each one of

895
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:49,870
the vm's they'll give you the level of

896
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,240
difficulty in the VM and the ones that

897
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:55,150
are rated easy or beginner we'll give

898
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,129
you some pointers on what to do some

899
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:59,050
hits to hack that system as you get to

900
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,580
the more difficult ones you get less

901
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,440
hits which they're kind of they wean you

902
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,880
off so once you get those more

903
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,250
experienced systems you've been working

904
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,600
this lab so long you really you know

905
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,150
hopefully working towards you don't need

906
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,029
the hits but it's a really good really

907
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,500
good place to start and I found out

908
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,810
through one of my students my first

909
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,580
semester someone recommended recommended

910
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,110
it to him and I really don't like to

911
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:23,170
recommend things unless I've try it

912
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:25,390
myself so I had I got you know like a 90

913
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:27,010
day subscription to it and played around

914
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,470
with it's a really good really good

915
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:32,830
learning resource and then pentester

916
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:35,200
academy they've recently added some labs

917
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,150
it's amazing the number of labs they

918
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,049
have on there now anything from Web

919
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:43,030
Application pen testing to network they

920
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,320
have CTF

921
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,720
they've got stuff

922
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,520
related to Wireshark different Network

923
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,790
sniffing I mean it's a really great

924
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:54,370
resource then practical pen test labs

925
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:57,400
this one is super cheap I think this one

926
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:59,230
was like $64 for lifetime access it's

927
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,480
got a little short course it's got some

928
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:05,320
online labs that you access through a

929
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:08,350
VPN and then these next items below are

930
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,310
free resources and bugcrowd University

931
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,230
if you're wanting to be a security

932
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:13,120
researcher or if you're wanting to just

933
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,550
be a pen tester there's some very good

934
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,620
information on there that covers a lot

935
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:20,320
of the good basics for penetration

936
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:23,170
webapp pen testing and this this

937
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,690
semester I added this to my started a

938
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,130
web application pen testing course at

939
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,140
the Community College where I teach and

940
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:32,890
part of our curriculum is bugcrowd

941
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:34,870
University so we covered that and the

942
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,670
SANS pen testing blog this is a good

943
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:40,980
place for all the cheat sheets for in

944
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:44,380
map Metasploit so i would sign up for

945
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,060
sans to get their emails to get more

946
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,730
information but the blog follow that

947
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:51,279
blog we have a lot of good how to's and

948
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,540
cheat sheets and then hacking tutorials

949
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,700
don't work this is another great site

950
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,410
this one was actually created by the

951
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,419
people that created virtual hacking labs

952
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:00,640
only this is a free site they've got

953
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,700
tutorials on open boss which is the open

954
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,680
source vulnerability scanner as well as

955
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,149
in map tutorials and Metasploit there's

956
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,690
a lot of really good tutorials on there

957
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:12,640
and this is free and then cyber AIT

958
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,940
they've got some some good resources on

959
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,080
there actually the advanced pen testing

960
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,630
course on there was created by georgia

961
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,430
Weidman and i actually was was using

962
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,410
those videos for my class so that way

963
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:26,230
they'd have some videos to go along with

964
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:28,330
their reading assignments and labs and

965
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,330
then the web security Academy this is

966
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:32,710
ports where the creators of burp suite

967
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:36,460
they've come out with instead of

968
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:38,650
updating their web application hacker's

969
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,960
handbook they're going to start

970
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,090
publishing new content to their web

971
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,090
security academy and they just recently

972
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:47,770
added more content this was part of the

973
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:50,530
curriculum for my students two semester

974
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:53,259
part of their labs were to go on on on

975
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:55,630
to this website and go through the

976
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,910
different tutorials on there they give

977
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,319
you really good explanations of the

978
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,970
vulnerabilities and how to exploit them

979
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,920
and then you have labs that you can

980
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:05,049
actually try out the exploits for those

981
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,539
vulnerabilities and of course they're

982
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:09,609
covering that so far the main some of

983
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:13,180
the big ones of the OWASP top 10 in

984
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:15,670
OWASP org this is another great site the

985
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,368
OWASP top 10 there's a lot of free tools

986
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:20,140
on there like burp I mean like a SAP

987
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:22,720
attack proxy which is a good replacement

988
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,460
for burp suite if you don't have a

989
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,618
commercial license of burp suite and

990
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,500
there's like a page with just vulnerable

991
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:31,150
uh different vulnerable applications on

992
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,150
there a page dedicated that so that's

993
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,680
one if you're gonna do anything with web

994
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,849
application you have that you definitely

995
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,799
have to check out that for sure and I

996
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:40,720
recommend that dating one because all

997
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:44,288
pen testers need to know some level of

998
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,149
web application pin testing and then

999
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:48,460
hack the Box hack the box that you

1000
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,650
that's a good resource I saw recently on

1001
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:55,059
Twitter a 16 year old kid that just

1002
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:56,589
recently got his OS CP and he's been at

1003
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:59,530
he said he spent a year on hack the box

1004
00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:01,808
to get his OS CP so that's a really good

1005
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:05,260
one and over the wire CTF those are good

1006
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:05,859
like over the wire dot org core slash

1007
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,010
wargames

1008
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:14,890
I think it's the bandit CTF series that

1009
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:16,900
if you're wanting to learn about Linux

1010
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:19,538
security or UNIX security those are

1011
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:25,569
really good at learning Linux in UNIX

1012
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:28,809
security and after this this is already

1013
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:30,308
post up so if anyone wants this page of

1014
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:33,430
the links to the resources if you go to

1015
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:36,579
the hacker maker comm learning -

1016
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:40,529
resources this whole list is up there so

1017
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:44,589
it will be available there in

1018
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:47,349
certifications these first first - I got

1019
00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:50,859
listed the CH in pen test plus these are

1020
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:54,039
good entry-level certifications the CH

1021
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:56,470
is really widely recognized by HR and

1022
00:39:54,039 --> 00:40:00,730
management so these are ones that you

1023
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:03,129
know some that will help you get points

1024
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,539
towards you know HR for you on your

1025
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,930
resume because people are used to seeing

1026
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:11,160
these the CH is also a DoD cert so

1027
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,160
companies that

1028
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,640
or doing business with the government

1029
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:18,310
have government contracts they'd like to

1030
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,310
see people with DoD certs like the CH

1031
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,420
and CISSP a lot of the CompTIA certs are

1032
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,339
on that list I'm not sure if the pen

1033
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,470
test plus is made it yet but the pen

1034
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:28,299
test plus is anyone it's a little over

1035
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,399
it's coming up on a year old they

1036
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,520
released the beta stuff last year and I

1037
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,220
switched my class to the pen test plus

1038
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,359
to offer them a certification path at

1039
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,240
least the first two are just you know

1040
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,190
really good certifications to get your

1041
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,629
foot in the door but once you get we

1042
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,839
progress down this list like the sands

1043
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:50,530
GP n + OS CP these are two of the most

1044
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:52,839
widely listed certifications on for pen

1045
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,820
test jobs most often I see those

1046
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:57,279
actually these last four I see them a

1047
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,630
lot and the sand stuff is really good

1048
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,210
but it's expensive

1049
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:03,160
but then offensive security their

1050
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:07,089
content is really good and really

1051
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,859
recognized and with the the offensive

1052
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:11,200
security stuff you actually have to go

1053
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:16,150
into lab and hack into systems to get

1054
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:19,930
certified so it's more of a hands-on

1055
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:21,579
type exam opposed to answering questions

1056
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:23,848
and scenarios and stuff although there's

1057
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:26,619
a lot of value to the sand stuff but

1058
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:31,210
kind of to give you the where I see the

1059
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:34,540
value and stuff like the hands-on labs

1060
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:36,490
is a lot of pen test jobs you go for

1061
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,380
when they give you your technical

1062
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,459
interview part of the technical

1063
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,609
interview is they usually give you a

1064
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:44,619
Cali VM to hack into a vulnerable VM or

1065
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:47,650
a network they have set up as vulnerable

1066
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:49,839
that you perform in test on so although

1067
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,160
the the knowing the answers and

1068
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,529
understanding that knowledge is

1069
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,328
important that the hands-on aspect goes

1070
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:59,980
a long way towards getting a pen test

1071
00:41:55,329 --> 00:42:01,420
job the GXP n is sans advanced pen

1072
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,460
testing and exploit development that's

1073
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:08,079
kinda like the next level above these

1074
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:10,030
the GP n + OS CP and then osce is a is

1075
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:14,380
heavy on exploit development it's kind

1076
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:16,000
of similar to to the the GX pn but these

1077
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,010
are all really good certs to get to get

1078
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,030
your foot in the door and even though

1079
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,010
you want to make sure you know the

1080
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:23,440
contact is just having the certs a lot

1081
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,420
of times won't get you the job you gotta

1082
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,060
get a technical interview

1083
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:30,030
you've got to be able to explain

1084
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:31,500
different vulnerabilities methodologies

1085
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,000
and how to hack into things you need to

1086
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,800
understand these so if you go through

1087
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,130
one of these things don't make sure you

1088
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,190
stay you know practicing in the labs

1089
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:43,950
keep this content fresh because you get

1090
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,900
your OS CPE and say like you're working

1091
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:47,790
the helpdesk and then you finally get a

1092
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,580
chance to interview for a contest job

1093
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:51,750
three years later and you have to be

1094
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,430
keeping up with this you're probably

1095
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:56,520
gonna have a hard time in your technical

1096
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:57,509
interview so the certifications are

1097
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,310
definitely the way to get your friend

1098
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:01,830
the door I know a lot of awesome pen

1099
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:04,080
testers they have no certs but they're

1100
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:07,290
able to prove it on the interviews but

1101
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,090
as far as what I'd advise someone that's

1102
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:11,840
a beginner sometimes you need that

1103
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:15,270
certification just to get to get started

1104
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:18,030
in job tips professional networking

1105
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:20,610
community is huge I recommend to my

1106
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:22,050
students every semester to join the

1107
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:24,090
local meetups go to the local meetups

1108
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,310
you want to become a regular you want

1109
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:28,590
people to know you and kind of know what

1110
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:32,610
kind of jobs you're looking for I had a

1111
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:34,920
recruiter ask me for a list of students

1112
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,960
that might be interested in pentesting

1113
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,150
jobs so a lot of my students I knew of

1114
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,190
another guy that was a recent college

1115
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,260
grad the hit stated one of the last

1116
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,580
Isles hackers association meetings and

1117
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,130
I've known him for a couple years so I

1118
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:50,100
know he's good responsible person smart

1119
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:51,210
and can do the job and he had mentioned

1120
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:54,720
one meetings that he was looking for a

1121
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:57,060
pen testing job so once this recruiter

1122
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,919
approached me about the jobs I passed on

1123
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,509
his information he actually got the job

1124
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,400
so getting into the community and

1125
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,140
knowing people people knowing your skill

1126
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,390
set goes a long way my last two

1127
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,580
full-time pentesting jobs have been

1128
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:11,460
through people I know in the security

1129
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,200
community my local community and I get

1130
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,450
side work from people that I know in the

1131
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,520
community in LinkedIn you want a good

1132
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:18,960
LinkedIn profile this is not Facebook so

1133
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,360
you want to make sure you have a

1134
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,070
professional picture you know kind of

1135
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,140
you know it's like your resume to your

1136
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:27,930
online resume so keep it clean don't put

1137
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:30,839
controversial stuff on there have a

1138
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:32,609
professional picture on there you know

1139
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:35,250
be truthful like you would your resume

1140
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,140
new things you learn put on there but

1141
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,720
don't put something on you're not gonna

1142
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,330
be able explain

1143
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,580
in the interview and that's my advice on

1144
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:45,160
your resume period if you use some tool

1145
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,970
once you know you really want to put

1146
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,250
that on there and go through the

1147
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:50,589
interview and the more items you have on

1148
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:53,350
your resume that you're not able to

1149
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,840
answer how to use or describe then

1150
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:58,600
that's gonna kind of not look too good

1151
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,130
for an interview and prepare for your

1152
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,779
interviews so before you go in there

1153
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,430
especially when you're just starting out

1154
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,200
and you really might you don't know the

1155
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:07,899
OS top-10 like the back of your hand

1156
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,720
then I would recommend going up you know

1157
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,760
go through the OAuth top ten understand

1158
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,859
the vulnerabilities and how you're able

1159
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,020
to repeat those vulnerabilities early on

1160
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:19,450
in my career one of my best interviews I

1161
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,100
went over the wasp top ten like the day

1162
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,830
before the night before my interview and

1163
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,120
sure enough those come up on pentesting

1164
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,410
interviews more most of the

1165
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,660
vulnerabilities you're gonna hear can be

1166
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:33,790
easily a wasp popped in even though the

1167
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:35,200
people interviewing you may not even you

1168
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,970
know that may not be their background

1169
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,240
but those are just some of the most well

1170
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:41,560
known vulnerabilities out there and be

1171
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,259
able to explain the basics like the

1172
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,710
three 3-way TCP handshake in the OSI

1173
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,810
model

1174
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:48,040
people are still asked stuff like that

1175
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:52,029
especially me and getting a management

1176
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:53,860
you know maybe you're not using you know

1177
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,450
referring the LES model OSI model lot in

1178
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,330
the job you're currently in some

1179
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:59,140
management you know their background

1180
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,029
where they come from

1181
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,100
at a time where is more important so

1182
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:05,110
just kind of understand these the know a

1183
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,850
lot of these IT basics just brush up

1184
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:09,540
before you wanna don't be a total

1185
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:11,680
surprise look at the job description and

1186
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,090
the things they want you to know and

1187
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,339
make sure that maybe some of these tools

1188
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:17,200
you used go through review the tools

1189
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:25,600
brush up on it before you go into that

1190
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:27,250
interview and with that's all the

1191
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,430
content that I have prepared for this

1192
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:31,480
but I'll leave this open for questions

1193
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:33,430
all right we'll see if we have questions

1194
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:37,090
from the chat but thank you Phillip

1195
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:40,569

1198
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:57,290
all right we'll see if anything comes in

1199
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:59,870
through the chat does an awesome

1200
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:02,960
introduction thanks fellow well thank

1201
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:06,770
you my pleasure there's a lot of

1202
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:09,460
discussion going on especially

1203
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:12,200
around the certification stuff about

1204
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:16,670
like some people really rip on the sea

1205
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:19,370
eh and yeah I was just I was telling

1206
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:21,470
people oh my my personal view is that

1207
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:24,950
anything that shows that you're

1208
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:27,129
dedicated to the field gives you a leg

1209
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:29,330
up and the sea eh I think it's a

1210
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:31,520
cost-effective one and it does give you

1211
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:33,680
pass for like resume pile of someone who

1212
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,420
doesn't have it if you're not gonna take

1213
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,129
an entry-level cert and you're coming

1214
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,220
from nothing like you've never had a

1215
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:42,410
security job before you got to make sure

1216
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,959
to like put all of your CTF experience

1217
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:46,190
and you're like pen tester labs and all

1218
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,810
the stuff you put on the fly before that

1219
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:49,820
make sure to fit that into your resume

1220
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:51,380
because I mean at the end of the day a

1221
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,350
hiring manager who knows anything about

1222
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:56,930
security and I've done this lot is

1223
00:47:53,350 --> 00:48:00,890
looking for that passion or that proof

1224
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:02,089
that at least you put in effort to do to

1225
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,339
do the stuff even though you've never

1226
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:06,800
had a practical job to do it or the

1227
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,200
actual job to do it so that would be

1228
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,480
something I suggest yeah and I'm with

1229
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,689
you on the sea age I don't I'm not a fan

1230
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,220
of it myself and I've kind of you know

1231
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:17,510
kind of battle me for I've said some

1232
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:20,060
pretty negative comments before in the

1233
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:21,950
past about it and was approached by

1234
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:24,200
ec-council one time about helping with

1235
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,910
some content and just because I don't

1236
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,100
really believe in it I could but I mean

1237
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:29,960
I just couldn't bring myself to I feel

1238
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,270
like I was selling out but like you said

1239
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,340
it's a foot in the door and someone

1240
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,930
that's a desktop technician and they

1241
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,490
went through the time to stay the ceh

1242
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:39,799
that goes to show something because

1243
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:41,479
there's a lot of people that that will

1244
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,040
work in the field that don't put in the

1245
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,080
effort and so at least a shows or put an

1246
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,890
effort and trying to learn yeah

1247
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,080
absolutely

1248
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,129
the door you know just having those

1249
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:53,090
certifications that's when it's most

1250
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:54,380
important okay oh you go on accompany

1251
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,120
people senior experience they don't care

1252
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,590
about certifications because you're

1253
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,230
gonna be like explain how to do any kind

1254
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,540
of vulnerable

1255
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:04,050
your latest exploits and explained

1256
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:05,430
methodology all that easily but someone

1257
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:08,270
without that they definitely need it

1258
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:11,819
just even get you know someone to even

1259
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:14,940
yesterday I suggest the same thing to

1260
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,920
people like I personally I didn't finish

1261
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:20,190
college I dropped out and some people

1262
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:22,980
asked me about that and you know those

1263
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:26,220
first few years in your career it's all

1264
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:28,530
about showing that you've got the skills

1265
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,509
to pay the bills kind of thing and once

1266
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:32,640
you get past you know you kind of win

1267
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,619
people's trust and you can point to your

1268
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,690
resume that you have past projects with

1269
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:39,359
success obviously that helps but in

1270
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:41,280
those first early years that's why these

1271
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:45,569
things these certifications and whatnot

1272
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,190
can be helpful the weight yeah good you

1273
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:49,350
separate yourself from everyone else

1274
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:51,630
everyone else is coming in with a

1275
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:53,310
bachelor's degree none of them have

1276
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,080
searched than you have certs it's just

1277
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:59,990
kind of a way to stand out in the crowd

1278
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:03,210
exactly um Casey had a question about

1279
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:05,160
kind of the market he says given that

1280
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:07,380
the market tends to think about network

1281
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:11,100
and map testing as different things how

1282
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:14,490
do you think that difference affect what

1283
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:17,759
newcomers learn so he said he I think

1284
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:19,649
he's kind of suggesting like how can new

1285
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,460
bug hunters kind of make the transition

1286
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:25,950
from app testing to network penetration

1287
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:29,070
testing and how do those worlds kind of

1288
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:31,589
coexist with one another today in your

1289
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,910
experience I think as far as application

1290
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,170
understanding how to find the

1291
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,210
vulnerabilities and stuff you can

1292
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:38,250
translate it because I think if you know

1293
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,410
one or the other it's easier to learn

1294
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,850
the other I really think most people

1295
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:44,190
getting started out or more intimidated

1296
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:47,009
with the application side of things but

1297
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:50,880
yeah if you're just of course kind of

1298
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:53,940
like it might be showing how to analyze

1299
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,440
your skillset and do this the gap

1300
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,790
analysis on where you need to go so

1301
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,300
that's basically what someone would need

1302
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:01,680
to do look at the areas in a weekend and

1303
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:03,090
because you know even some people that

1304
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,649
are doing the web app maybe they

1305
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:07,410
understand web server somewhat and they

1306
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:09,630
understand HTTP protocols and stuff like

1307
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:12,058
that just they just need to I would say

1308
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:15,089
step back and learn the basic

1309
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,920
like Network+ related stuff you know and

1310
00:51:15,089 --> 00:51:19,140
you have to nest I do that Network+ but

1311
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,299
like professor Messer has a whole video

1312
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:23,368
series on a plus and Network+ and

1313
00:51:21,299 --> 00:51:27,949
security plus so that's what they we

1314
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:30,839
just need to to learn those areas okay

1315
00:51:27,949 --> 00:51:33,209
seems to be the biggest seems to be one

1316
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:35,038
of the biggest hurdles for most people

1317
00:51:33,209 --> 00:51:38,910
in general understanding the network and

1318
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,410
the piece of it Casey added an

1319
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:42,868
additional thing to his question he said

1320
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:47,339
or nope he just deleted it so maybe he

1321
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:49,769
didn't want that question but um let's

1322
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:51,959
see what else were people asking they

1323
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:56,999
were headaches here welcome to chime in

1324
00:51:51,959 --> 00:52:00,209
if you wanted yeah I mean I think

1325
00:51:56,999 --> 00:52:02,279
Casey's question was trying to basically

1326
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:04,198
separate out like again like a sub

1327
00:52:02,279 --> 00:52:07,380
question to the abstract versus and that

1328
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:09,539
second stuff I think I think my view on

1329
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,789
it is most pen tests these days like

1330
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:15,299
they get sold at least are actually

1331
00:52:11,789 --> 00:52:17,429
application tests that the network pen

1332
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:19,049
test style of port scanning and

1333
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:21,630
vulnerability assessment leading to

1334
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:23,160
exploitation then pivoting on the

1335
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:25,259
internal network and then exploiting

1336
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:28,678
more things and then getting domain

1337
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:31,529
controller you know access or you know

1338
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:34,739
access to personal data that that

1339
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:37,140
skillset is highly technical but I think

1340
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:39,449
it's I see it less and less these days

1341
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,890
and so a lot of pen testers so you

1342
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:44,369
should like do that for their full time

1343
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:47,339
Johnson move to red team jobs where they

1344
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:49,170
they now do like full scope pen testing

1345
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:51,749
and include social engineering and just

1346
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:54,449
do all kinds of adversarial simulation

1347
00:52:51,749 --> 00:52:57,629
and so really like you can start out

1348
00:52:54,449 --> 00:53:00,509
either way I actually think that think

1349
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:04,769
that net net pen is a little bit easier

1350
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:07,679
than aspect to get started pretty easy

1351
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:09,598
to learn how to like port scan and and

1352
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,059
then like do some vulnerability analysis

1353
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,729
and it also gets you like really fun up

1354
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:16,380
on scripting and you know sometimes some

1355
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:18,448
exploit development or at least learning

1356
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:21,809
how exploits work and so that's what

1357
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:23,160
it's a really good path so probably more

1358
00:53:21,809 --> 00:53:24,779
beneficial start out wasn't that pen and

1359
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,009
move into abstract but I think it's I

1360
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:27,690
think with me

1361
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,910
a challenge with half-sack is that

1362
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:32,580
there's so many different frameworks and

1363
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,710
like web servers and technologies and

1364
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:36,660
aspects so when I started learning

1365
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:38,370
aspect it was super daunting it was just

1366
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,810
like there is so much crap on the

1367
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:43,560
internet that I have no idea how it

1368
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:45,600
works so it was beneficial for me to

1369
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,029
start in that pen and move to abstract

1370
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,339
because I had the hacker mindset and I

1371
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,800
knew I knew kind of like that the core

1372
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:54,450
of all security problems are a lot of

1373
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,250
the core of all security problems are

1374
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,890
like configuration issues and input

1375
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:01,050
issues right like putting stuff close to

1376
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,279
go and things being misconfigured and so

1377
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,720
it because I knew that from Network

1378
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,130
moving the abstract I definitely had the

1379
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,870
right mind Tretton I tried to get spun

1380
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:11,160
up on everything else so that would be

1381
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:13,560
my answer I guess yeah I agree with that

1382
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,420
I think also too with a lot of people

1383
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,520
you know because because you remember

1384
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,960
earlier on they weren't doing

1385
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,090
reoccurring vulnerability scans

1386
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,320
internally and so I think since more

1387
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,510
companies are starting to do more of

1388
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,970
that kind of between their pen tests I

1389
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:28,500
think there's less stuff out there the

1390
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:30,240
scope of the pen test probably lighter

1391
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:34,040
because they're not fine as much stuff

1392
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:37,500
and it's easily to go easy to go through

1393
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:39,060
yeah I mean I I was just gonna say one

1394
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:42,240
of the things one of our analyst about

1395
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:44,700
Kevin he's you know he worked for us

1396
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,100
full time now but he he was in one of my

1397
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:50,279
asset classes and he had zero experience

1398
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:52,080
and a couple of couple that he put

1399
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,730
himself through all of the pen testers

1400
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,770
lab things and pen tester lab now has

1401
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:58,920
free certifications that you can get if

1402
00:54:55,770 --> 00:55:01,920
you complete a whole bunch of their

1403
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,110
exercises in a row but you can get free

1404
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,880
certification that doesn't like mean a

1405
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,200
bunch in the industry but it is a

1406
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,780
certification and you can put it on your

1407
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,240
resume and like it's you know like I

1408
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,310
guess like resume building for a spec or

1409
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,930
a pen test or the security information

1410
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,900
could probably be its own talk and like

1411
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:20,069
what to focus on how to do it but

1412
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:22,380
there's a whole bunch of paths to get

1413
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:24,120
into this so yeah yeah like the pen

1414
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,010
tester lab stuff and how now they've got

1415
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,170
it set up to where you can post it on on

1416
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,980
your LinkedIn profile shown what badges

1417
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:32,130
you've completed

1418
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:37,010
yeah it's oh someone's actively learning

1419
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:37,010
too small lessons

1420
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,340
you

1421
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:25,080
yeah as far as teaching I can't really

1422
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:26,730
think of anything maybe if I could add

1423
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,770
like an advanced pentesting course at

1424
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:30,360
the college where I'm at I was wanting

1425
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:31,740
to add what about pen testing which I

1426
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,570
was able to add this semester which was

1427
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:35,850
good it was nice to add something new

1428
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:37,080
because after so many semesters teaching

1429
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:41,279
the same thing it's nice to have

1430
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:43,650
something new in there and what is most

1431
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,030
profitable if you're talking from a

1432
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,490
teaching perspective I guess have you

1433
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:50,270
taught like its sands or something like

1434
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:54,930
that probably most profitable if you did

1435
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:56,190
you know private teaching which for me

1436
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:58,859
it's kind of as interesting because that

1437
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:00,180
someone recently asked want me to do

1438
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:02,160
some training for their company which I

1439
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:04,529
would do but I've had individuals come

1440
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,569
up and ask me hey I want you to be my

1441
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:08,370
mentor if I pay you will you teach me

1442
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:10,890
and I can't take money from an

1443
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:12,210
individual I mean I got into teaching to

1444
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:14,220
help other people I teach at a community

1445
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:16,440
college and that's I had the opportunity

1446
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:18,270
to teach at a private school and make

1447
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,460
more but I like to be able to teach

1448
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:23,520
people I want people bill afford it if

1449
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:26,070
my dream is if I had say like if I have

1450
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,380
a dream come true for me is if I won the

1451
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:30,900
lottery or someone gave me millions of

1452
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:33,180
dollars here do this I would start up a

1453
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,970
free school you know I'd offer a free

1454
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:37,859
school and it wouldn't it would be

1455
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:39,410
focused on security and pentesting and

1456
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:41,340
it would start out with some of the more

1457
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:42,839
elementary things to get people up to

1458
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,630
speed where they need to be good pen

1459
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,490
tester but if I just had something this

1460
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:51,210
big chunk of money I would start a free

1461
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:52,589
school because teaching people that's

1462
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:54,090
one of the reasons I started pong school

1463
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:57,570
was because some people were having

1464
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:59,220
difficulties getting in my class and you

1465
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:00,540
know I wanted something that affordable

1466
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:03,209
for anyone so all they have to do is

1467
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:04,890
show up and learn so if I could do

1468
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:06,720
whatever I wanted to that's why do you

1469
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:08,940
and just teaching helping people is

1470
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,319
rewarding you know it's not about the

1471
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,120
money because I could make more money

1472
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,980
teaching somewhere else but I continue

1473
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:16,020
to teach at a community college I like

1474
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,460
that it's affordable most people can

1475
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,930
afford it themselves or they can get

1476
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,510
student loans or their companies will

1477
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:23,100
pay for it so I like the affordability

1478
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,380
yeah that's kind of one of the things I

1479
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,060
like about bug bounties and like

1480
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:29,280
bugcrowd they're offering opportunities

1481
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,840
to people that otherwise wouldn't had it

1482
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,770
have it and that's kind of why I think

1483
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,140
I've

1484
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:35,670
kind of fit in with your culture because

1485
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:38,009
I really believe in helping others and

1486
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:41,280
it's just not about not about the money

1487
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:44,010
when it comes to that well that's a good

1488
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,940
