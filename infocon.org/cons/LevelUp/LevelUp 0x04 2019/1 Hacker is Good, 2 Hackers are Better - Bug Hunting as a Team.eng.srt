okay that's fine yeah thank you very

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,690
much for having

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,880
as mentioned before our Taurus one

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,640
hacker is good to Equis a better Park

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,700
hunting as a team and we really want to

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,849
dive in in our challenges and also the

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,970
advantages of hunting as a team and so

8
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:33,260
let's get started first of all a little

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:36,500
bit about the agenda you yeah might

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,320
heard something about in Ted wah org we

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,329
will tell something about our story how

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,390
we teamed up what have been our

13
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:47,629
challenges and what you can learn about

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,539
it and we also have some few ideas about

15
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:53,449
the future for researchers and also for

16
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:56,300
bug bounty hunting platforms so yeah I

17
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:57,968
hope it's really interesting for you to

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,099
hear our story

19
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:03,379
first of all Sebastian unfortunately it

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,030
did not make it today to this talk

21
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,450
because he's on another hacker

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:11,300
conference in Germany so yes that's also

23
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,060
an advantages as the team that one

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,920
person for example can give this talk

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,080
yet another person is on a security

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,870
conference and can run a lot of stuff

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,780
but I'm pretty sure that he will also

28
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:27,560
answer your questions later or might

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:30,440
also be there on social media as I

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,590
mentioned it Sebastian if he's master

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,530
student at university here in Berlin and

32
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:41,690
he is doing freelancing and as a hacker

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:44,390
he also is in the CTF team you know flag

34
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:47,420
which is playing yeah

35
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,370
CTS as mentioned before and it's really

36
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:53,150
fun for him and she's also a co-author

37
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:56,000
of a cybersecurity book and yeah

38
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:59,750
lost to see new research adds getting

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,490
into yeah fancy security stuff and on

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,220
the right side you can see me my name is

41
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:07,009
Tim Phillips Schafer's I'm working as a

42
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,800
IT security consultants at a company

43
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:13,879
which is mainly focusing on information

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,930
security and I'm also of two German

45
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:20,859
InfoSec books one is about I Triple E

46
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:23,780
802.11 so while a security knee of

47
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,460
wireless networks and another one is

48
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,190
about a web application

49
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:32,350
it's called hacking web it's the German

50
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:35,240
book about web application security so

51
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,730
first of all I want to tell you a story

52
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,430
how we got started in Tubac hunting

53
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,640
because prior to 2012 we have been

54
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,850
individuals and yeah when he did

55
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,890
responsible disclosure I by myself have

56
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,829
not even heard about the term bug bounty

57
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:55,329
program so at this time I was just kind

58
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:58,340
of a little students going to school and

59
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:01,760
found some fancy bugs on some web sites

60
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,960
reported it and then there was always a

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,239
bit discussion about finding and telling

62
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,000
the companies what we are doing why we

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,830
are doing this and yeah we both has

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,250
different skill sets and areas of focus

65
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:19,040
and also we are still or we have been

66
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,560
learning at these days so we improved

67
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,820
later that was really easy early days of

68
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,980
our project so responsible disclosure

69
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,890
was hard at that time there was no

70
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,640
central back party platform yet so there

71
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:37,309
have been bounty programs like Facebook

72
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,920
or Google but not that many companies

73
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,260
into that business also some

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,559
administrators ignored our emails or

75
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:48,620
even if we call them by phone there was

76
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,290
one very big German car manufacturer he

77
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,050
told us that he has no idea who is

78
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,299
responsible for a certain sub domain so

79
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,280
that was really frustrating because we

80
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,970
really saw a problem there for example

81
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,980
that you had access to customer data and

82
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,830
they were not even caring about this

83
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,959
so sometimes we just went to some

84
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:13,460
journalists to get kind of a pressure

85
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:17,269
for this certain problem and yeah then

86
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,730
we thought about a project and instead

87
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,240
of you responsible disclosure programs

88
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,700
at this time there have been a few and

89
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,550
some companies already had this security

90
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,039
page at that time back crowd also had a

91
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,620
very fancy website where there really

92
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,840
presented what companies really care

93
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,800
about your back reports and that really

94
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,810
helped us at the beginning

95
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,479
so our first responsible disclosure

96
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,090
program where were you really

97
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,979
participated in was from eBay and we

98
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,719
thought about it and seeing Meraki was

99
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:52,300
the first bug bounty program at that

100
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,740
time where we participated and get paid

101
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:59,289
for a back so in 2012 we have been very

102
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,270
active and also in the reason yes last

103
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:05,289
week we are still doing responsible

104
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:07,870
scotia and ethical hacking yeah so let's

105
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:11,550
move on a few words about early days

106
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:16,030
that's really important to me because

107
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,340
yeah everybody starts somewhere and it's

108
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,469
really an important thing that you don't

109
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,349
get frustrated by the success of others

110
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:26,470
so you might see those people on Twitter

111
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:28,780
or even they're writing a blog post how

112
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,909
successful they are and yeah you should

113
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,799
not get frustrated by that because

114
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:35,409
everybody starts somewhere and it's

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,379
always good to focus on your own

116
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:40,300
research and topics and share your

117
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,669
successes so if you have achieved

118
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,560
something some other person on the

119
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:46,810
internet or on this planet might be

120
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,680
interesting at that so yeah that's

121
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,479
really important I would say and of

122
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,219
course you are also not alone look for

123
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,490
people with the same interest that is

124
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:59,110
paid in a project or attend a conference

125
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,150
there are so many conferences out there

126
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,599
where you really can match great people

127
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,909
and you can really learn stuff out there

128
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:09,460
so that's really important keep learning

129
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:11,469
read books or reports from other people

130
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:15,039
also blog post but don't get frustrated

131
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:16,990
as mentioned before it's yeah

132
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,770
just an idea to get to improve your own

133
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:24,539
skills to just see that and also another

134
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:27,479
tip also watch Life overflow secrets

135
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:30,729
step-by-step guides to learn hacking

136
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,710
this is kind of a funny video because

137
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,529
there is no secret guide but it really

138
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:38,859
helps you to yeah get a kind of a focus

139
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:41,169
how you can improve your skills and yeah

140
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,360
get an idea about this so everybody

141
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:47,049
starts somewhere it's yeah really good

142
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:51,730
to look at different resources resources

143
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:54,910
and yeah just keep on working on that

144
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:57,460
then how we teamed up we really face the

145
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,710
same problems as mentioned before we

146
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,289
started as individuals reporting bucks

147
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,810
to companies and really was a problem

148
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,150
for example to describe those people

149
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,280
while we are doing this so not everybody

150
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,890
is familiar to Whitehead hacking

151
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,590
projects or even back bounty programs or

152
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:17,110
responsible disclosure even some big

153
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,140
companies for example in Germany did not

154
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,300
know what that was and yeah that's

155
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,740
really kind of a problem so we came up

156
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,780
and thought about it hmm

157
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,750
we have a vision why aren't we putting

158
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:32,799
our idea so what we are doing on website

159
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,900
and we also both has a passion for info

160
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,290
sex so we really moved on and thought

161
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,049
hmm

162
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,710
might be a good idea if we really push

163
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,600
that project forward

164
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,210
another very important thing is said

165
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,430
both of us had the willing to share and

166
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,440
learn from each other

167
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,110
Sebastian for example is very good in

168
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,420
scripting and also writing certain

169
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,910
exploits even more than just web

170
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:01,270
applications things so I really learned

171
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,730
a lot from him so that's very nice and I

172
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:06,820
think also he learned a few things from

173
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:09,490
me so yeah sharing is caring I would say

174
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,409
so you can just improve your skills and

175
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,930
learn from each other that's pretty

176
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,360
great

177
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:19,840
then you can also learn sir and tricks

178
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,940
tips methodology or even tools so by

179
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,390
tools we mean tools which are outside

180
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,790
you did not know and then as a person is

181
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,909
saying wow we can use this tool to I

182
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:33,820
don't know find out DNS records of a

183
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,740
certain domain and that's really helping

184
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,080
you because you have for example an

185
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,090
endpoint and you just need more

186
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,599
informations about it so that's really

187
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:46,150
good great you also have a partner to

188
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,120
discuss findings or problems for example

189
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:52,000
if you want to bypass something that can

190
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,580
be really helpful - yeah just talk to

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,990
somebody about this and not sitting in a

192
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,210
basement and trying out how - yeah by

193
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:05,139
past a certain filter or something like

194
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:09,639
that so that ya can also be very helpful

195
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:11,619
and of course one area's also that you

196
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,470
can establish a friendship for example

197
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:16,689
Sebastian and I really love to do things

198
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,119
together not even hacking but also

199
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:22,569
hacking and hacking things together is

200
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:24,970
even more fun because if you combine for

201
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:29,738
example certain exploits you really get

202
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,869
deep into some things deeper s you would

203
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:34,809
expect at the beginning and that's

204
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:37,389
really only happening I would say at

205
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:39,910
this point if you put all your skills

206
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:44,739
together and you are really working on

207
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:46,509
ya 1.2 for example achieve certain

208
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:50,230
exploit or find a certain park on a

209
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:52,089
website that's really great but there

210
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,959
are also some very important questions

211
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:58,629
because not everybody is like yeah I

212
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:01,449
love to team up or things like that so

213
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:03,639
you should answer the following

214
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:06,878
questions for yourself before you are

215
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:09,699
teaming up what do you want to do as a

216
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,009
team so is there a certain vision what's

217
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:16,359
your real goal you want to achieve with

218
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:20,110
this teaming up whom do you trust do you

219
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,660
really trust your teammate or only yeah

220
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,910
regarding regarding certain points or

221
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,029
you want to really share everything with

222
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:31,600
the teammates what's a perfect team size

223
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:33,579
it's also a point where we kind of get

224
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,769
confronted with because there were other

225
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:38,498
people who were interested in our

226
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:41,189
project and at some point we were four

227
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:45,100
people at Edoardo talk for example and

228
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:47,259
did some kind of research but yeah it's

229
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,799
not always a good idea to have a big

230
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:53,649
team so yeah we kind of split up at some

231
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,600
points so as a teammate still doing

232
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:58,539
great things where in exchange with them

233
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,649
but not everybody that's also where we

234
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:05,919
come later on has the same amount of

235
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:08,829
time or yeah even skills so that's

236
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,629
really something where you should also

237
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:13,449
think about before you are doing

238
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:16,509
something like that then do we share the

239
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:19,050
same values or ideas you don't have to

240
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,910
share the same values and ideas but it's

241
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,660
can be really helpful if you have the

242
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,860
same vision or goal or even idea and

243
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,380
about the values it's very interesting

244
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,200
sometimes it even helps if you are more

245
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,570
diverse so if there are different

246
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,430
opinions on something then real

247
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,410
discussion is happening regarding the

248
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:41,969
project also regarding vulnerabilities

249
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:43,260
so that can be really helpful and do we

250
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,200
have fun together that's also a very

251
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,089
important question is this just yeah

252
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,910
working on a certain project or you

253
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:54,870
really like to have fun together

254
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,640
for example as internet waha we have

255
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,070
been on several trips and other

256
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,740
countries and yeah even hacked there so

257
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,310
that was very funny for us and you

258
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:08,010
really yeah have to know each other very

259
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,599
good to do something like that I willing

260
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,540
to share your knowledge that's also a

261
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:17,100
very good question because sometimes you

262
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:19,529
might have tricks which yeah kind of top

263
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,370
secret and are you willing to share them

264
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:26,279
with as a team mates you should think

265
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,290
about this otherwise there might be

266
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,510
conflicts within the group for example

267
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,810
if you report certain bugs or don't

268
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:37,319
share you a way of exploiting things so

269
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,719
yeah you should talk about that before

270
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,560
so that are just some example questions

271
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,550
there might be even more but for us

272
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:50,550
those seem to be the most important ones

273
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:52,920
then a little bit about our project the

274
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:57,300
funny thing is that it had haha this

275
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:01,199
german foreign hedge guard and when we

276
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:03,719
started in 2012 we don't even had a

277
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,589
focus on english people so mainly we

278
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:10,649
started as a german block and later when

279
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:12,420
we get our a level for example and we

280
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:15,149
went to certain conferences we learned

281
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:18,839
that most of the people are not able to

282
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:21,269
speak out it had waha torque because the

283
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,320
CH in english

284
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:27,149
really sounds funny so mainly it's kind

285
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,209
of a brand today everybody is really

286
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:32,140
reading intent waha but yeah sometimes

287
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:35,109
you know those nicknames are not

288
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,810
so easy to speak today we would stick to

289
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,730
another name which is more international

290
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,410
like intent gods but I think there are

291
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,450
also yeah

292
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,370
other projects out there with you know

293
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,860
the familiar name so we are really happy

294
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:51,640
to ask inside wahad org as the german

295
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,500
name in the back party community as i

296
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:58,210
mentioned before we kind of started as a

297
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:01,240
blog or website and we started as a kind

298
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:03,550
of faq so lets admins and people know

299
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,180
who we are and why we are reporting

300
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:09,430
security issues that really sounds easy

301
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,680
but as i mentioned before if you write

302
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,660
an email and who needs most of the email

303
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,689
just to explain why you are reporting

304
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,640
this then you really think okay it's

305
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,940
better to have a website for that and

306
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,060
just the email just place the technical

307
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,100
details so they can you add a website if

308
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,459
they are really interested in this

309
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:33,640
project so that's what the first idea of

310
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,520
that waha talk really was we also had

311
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,530
some write-ups and interesting findings

312
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,840
for example also some blog posts from

313
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,589
Sebastian about certain CDF challenges

314
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:47,530
and yeah it's really a nice place for us

315
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,180
to publish conducted research and we

316
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,060
also have a Twitter handle at entered

317
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,010
waha so if you are interested in

318
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:58,060
research or what we are doing you might

319
00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:01,689
follow us yeah we also like to retweet

320
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,880
other very interesting research so yeah

321
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,700
make sure you do this on the right side

322
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,650
you can see the kind of first page we

323
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,870
implemented on intent voqal.org

324
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,760
there was really why we're doing this

325
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,460
the problem the idea and what's

326
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,370
responsible disclosure to make sure that

327
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,860
everybody out there understands it and

328
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:24,880
today it really sounds funny but in 2012

329
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:27,550
for us in Germany it was really yeah big

330
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,240
step forwards to explain this to the

331
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:33,760
people out there so as I mentioned

332
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,410
before internet via dot org was not even

333
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,200
about back bounty programs at the

334
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:41,589
beginning because we know we did not

335
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,110
know about back bounty programs at the

336
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,580
beginning we just found crazy big web

337
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,850
sites or e-commerce

338
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:51,670
with servo nura bilities and thought why

339
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,680
was this yeah sure what happen we have

340
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:56,680
to call the administrator or give him

341
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,920
some informations about this and then we

342
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,469
get know about for example back route at

343
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,779
the beginning that was really a kind of

344
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,510
yeah just one website where you could

345
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:11,560
report vulnerabilities wire Google Forms

346
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:14,649
so a really a Minimum Viable Product X

347
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,810
the beginning but for us edge dream came

348
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:18,820
true because we could do what we love

349
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,880
and even get paid for that that was

350
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:24,010
really great and so we started hunting

351
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,350
on various platforms and back bounty

352
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:29,319
programs because yeah we had a lot of

353
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,630
time back then and thought this is one

354
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,660
thing how we can improve the security of

355
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:39,700
the Internet and that was also one main

356
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:44,410
goal of Tetrarch so you you can see a

357
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:47,260
few things we did we have been in 2014

358
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,439
for example in the backdrop of 10 long

359
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:53,589
time ago you can see in old screenshots

360
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,589
we had a very fancy back in paypal calm

361
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:59,110
we had their past reversal and we also

362
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:02,110
did some research about git repositories

363
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,530
and adopts des store files within the

364
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:08,770
Alexa top 1 million and as mentioned

365
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:11,439
before today for us back hunting is not

366
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:15,040
only about about bug bounty programs but

367
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:18,750
also ethical hacking and what that means

368
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:22,959
to us you can see later for example we

369
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:26,859
also hand bucks within web site which

370
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,750
are not even part of a big company but

371
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:32,439
are very important for the society or

372
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:34,870
improve the internet security by yeah

373
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,390
conducting to open-source projects and

374
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:40,600
so on that's also part of hacking and

375
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,940
here's some example at the end of the

376
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,899
last year we were able to find some

377
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,900
water purification plants in Germany so

378
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,700
several and we even were able to spot

379
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,429
some vulnerabilities within the software

380
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:58,900
and as you might know industrial control

381
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:59,450
systems yeah our mod sets state of the

382
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,409
art secure

383
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:05,659
the focus project so we really were

384
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:08,600
happy to help at this point because you

385
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:11,600
can imagine what might happen if some

386
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,820
yeah bad guys out there might find some

387
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,769
vulnerabilities within the software and

388
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:21,289
even yeah for example put down the

389
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:23,960
plants as it would not be very nice so

390
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:28,399
yeah we're really happy to have this

391
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,399
ethical hacking standpoint nowadays we

392
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,658
also had media and press coverage and

393
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:35,090
even hearing within the European

394
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:39,230
Parliament and there have been several

395
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:41,990
films interviews and other articles for

396
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:46,490
example about hacking and hackers for us

397
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:50,179
it's always yeah nice thing to present

398
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:53,750
us as team but also lacking community in

399
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:57,679
general I think this is also because we

400
00:18:53,750 --> 00:19:00,169
are kind of yeah doing we're having a

401
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,289
website where we explain what we do if

402
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:07,820
you are an individual then you might not

403
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:10,519
be able to yea bees is kind of kind of

404
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,889
professional so that the media thinks

405
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:16,340
you really have to kind of say something

406
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:19,428
it's really sounds strange but yeah it's

407
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,129
kind of a feeling we have so it can also

408
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:24,260
help you if you team up for example that

409
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,779
you have yeah a more professional

410
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,580
website or even media comes to you and

411
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,860
say hey it's really interesting what you

412
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,230
are doing as a team or together and

413
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,570
that's also a thing where different

414
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,760
people can bring in the expertise for

415
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,830
example technical people or people who

416
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,340
are more interested in public relations

417
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:45,980
and things like that so we really yeah

418
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,730
look at our task and see who is doing

419
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:52,549
what how we can improve our project and

420
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,769
work and of course we have also been

421
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:58,039
through some conferences for example at

422
00:19:54,769 --> 00:20:00,889
back roads last conferences or we did a

423
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:05,240
talk at code talks which is a kind of

424
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:07,908
big conference here in Germany so we

425
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,039
were really happy to get some general

426
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:12,559
ideas and even explain to people what

427
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,309
park boundary programs are so that's

428
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,490
also car

429
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:18,559
of tasks we many stick to to just share

430
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,960
knowledge in order to improve the

431
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:25,820
security for example of e-commerce shops

432
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:29,179
here in Germany then I want to explain

433
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:32,720
how we deal with back hunting and what

434
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:35,259
kind of tools we are using or used in

435
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,440
the past for first of all we had this

436
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:42,769
bug hunting sessions that could be an

437
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,259
ayat or yeah just a day where we just

438
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:48,740
sit down and say okay we have to find

439
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:51,619
back in this back boundary program or in

440
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,590
this certain application and for us it's

441
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:56,689
always yeah kind of learning things and

442
00:20:54,590 --> 00:21:01,220
have fun heck stuff and not just

443
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:04,580
focusing on the bug bounty so it's yeah

444
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,950
for us a positive side effect but as we

445
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:10,129
are not doing this on full time we are

446
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:14,179
happy to find certain bugs and happy to

447
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:17,658
also improve the security so as you can

448
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:20,029
see that we we did the several hours

449
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:22,369
long sessions for example in the evening

450
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:25,610
and at the beginning of intent vaca we

451
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:30,139
seemingly choose random targets at the

452
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:32,029
beginning just big web sites to see if

453
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:35,119
we are able to find a vulnerability

454
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:37,279
there and I can tell you most of the

455
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,168
times where we had this kind of hunting

456
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,259
sessions we were able to spot one

457
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:45,230
vulnerability in a website and even some

458
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:48,289
critical ones in very big websites here

459
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:51,379
in Germany for us it's always motivation

460
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:53,299
and you can discuss at loss and also do

461
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:55,459
a lot thinking for example if you find

462
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:58,850
out what kind of talk Knology they are

463
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,289
using how the different components of

464
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,379
the architecture are working together

465
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:05,419
it's really nice to hear yeah different

466
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:09,649
opinions about that so you can really

467
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:11,929
discuss how you might get a back into

468
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:14,209
this kind of applications and we also

469
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:17,360
have this kind of research topics as I

470
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:20,539
mentioned before and for those we might

471
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,350
even have several such hunting sessions

472
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:26,960
so we say okay let's look for example

473
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:29,689
two weeks how many days can

474
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,289
make free and what's our target for

475
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,620
example we did this for this industrial

476
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:39,200
control systems we looked at a certain

477
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:41,989
software which is very widespread here

478
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,330
in Europe and we were really able to

479
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:46,850
find even these plans which were

480
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,520
accessible from the internet so that was

481
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,830
really something where we put a lot of

482
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,080
effort and work into and at the end we

483
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:57,260
were very successful reported this to

484
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,779
the German Church so computer emergency

485
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,210
response team and they reported it to

486
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:04,940
the companies and they fixed it within

487
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:08,600
the software and even within the

488
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:10,970
critical infrastructure itself why is

489
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,850
this Punk back hunting sessions are very

490
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:16,250
important on the one hand you can have

491
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,949
different tasks and one person is for

492
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,409
example doing some recon and the other

493
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,529
person is doing in this analysis this

494
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:27,020
can be really helpful and for us for us

495
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:29,720
it's a very efficient way to yeah focus

496
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,570
on one target and get most of the

497
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,789
informations out of it and yeah that's

498
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:37,629
that's really great for us then it's

499
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:40,010
also kind of quality assurance because

500
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:43,250
double-checking findings is always

501
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:47,090
pretty nice sometimes you don't see all

502
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:49,520
of the things or you might even have not

503
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,549
looked deep interesting so the other

504
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,340
person might even find more things so

505
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:58,520
that's really great also good to do

506
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,908
proofreading of the reports in order to

507
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,970
get most of the points or kudos so that

508
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:07,250
you are really sure that triage team is

509
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:10,100
understanding this back and not that

510
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,779
just three lines of code and everybody

511
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,760
is asking so what's happening there

512
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:16,039
that's really good

513
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,760
to improve the quality of the reports

514
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:22,190
and we also love to create fancy proof

515
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,490
of concept for example some videos or

516
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:28,190
even a script which which is doing

517
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:31,970
something so that's also more fun

518
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:34,070
together and you can also say okay I

519
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,220
will do a proof of concept of that you

520
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:40,280
can go on and do for example recon stuff

521
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:44,000
like that so sharing of tasks

522
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:46,910
is really an advantage of teaming how we

523
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,620
communicated we used certain tools for

524
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,620
example Skype at the beginnings and we

525
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:54,469
stick to teamspeak at Jabba so you see

526
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:57,260
in online meetings it's their various

527
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:59,450
ways but yeah most of the tools are more

528
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,310
or less equal so that's not one point

529
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,430
where we should say okay you really have

530
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,629
to use this tool yeah just choose one

531
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,390
and be happy with it

532
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:10,880
of course we also have offline meetings

533
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,500
when we talked about our spread Judy for

534
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,250
example what do you want to do as

535
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:19,970
interpreted or and where do we put some

536
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:23,270
focus in and yeah just sit somewhere

537
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:26,960
during sheds you can also join some

538
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:30,820
conferences and her new research topic

539
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:34,220
you might yeah look into it as a team so

540
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,710
another very important thing for us was

541
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,540
that we have tools for a sample is a pet

542
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,570
for real-time exchange of endpoints

543
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:43,190
ideas output and even write-ups so we

544
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,669
were able to write blog post together

545
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:50,210
things like that we hosted this on a own

546
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:53,330
server and we also had an own pastebin

547
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:57,350
service even in hosting script for

548
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:00,169
images and shared email inboxes so

549
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,389
that's kind of very important things

550
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:05,120
that you really can share and work

551
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,670
together on things is a pet is still

552
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,459
working for us and it's really important

553
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:13,490
for us to just have for example one pet

554
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,950
for one bug bounty program we are

555
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,900
participating in or one research so

556
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,690
everybody finds information and one

557
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:24,950
document and can add certain things if

558
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:26,750
they would like to and yeah of course

559
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,650
shared email inboxes are also very

560
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:32,480
important I come to this in a moment

561
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:35,480
because communication is very important

562
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,500
we have know who tested what endpoint

563
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,780
and how what was not tested and if there

564
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,590
have been any strange behavior that's

565
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,670
very important so documenting everything

566
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:50,689
communication really is the key at this

567
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:52,100
point you also have to know what was not

568
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:55,039
reported

569
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:59,059
for example if you want to chain a

570
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:02,029
certain exploit serious then you might

571
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:05,840
be interested in yeah not reporting a

572
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:11,059
back but working on a even better proof

573
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:13,488
of concept and also you should exchange

574
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:16,850
about currently scans which you are

575
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:18,769
doing and further or future targets did

576
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:22,189
you get a reward for vulnerabilities and

577
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:24,799
you should check this out and say okay

578
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,679
we really reported this and it's

579
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,539
finished for us and we need answer

580
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,659
questions provide any details and who

581
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:35,619
can do this so it's also an advantage if

582
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:39,200
one person for example is very busy with

583
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:41,238
his master thesis or budget eases then

584
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,279
it's really great that you know ok

585
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:46,999
another person is dealing about this

586
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:50,359
so yeah that's worked out really well

587
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:52,639
for us then how we manage our findings

588
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:54,019
that's also very interesting because at

589
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:57,109
the beginning we really had a known

590
00:27:54,019 --> 00:28:00,349
forum which was hosted and we had one

591
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:02,658
thread per report we did and we had

592
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:04,580
different categories for example for

593
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:07,700
responsible dystocia and back party

594
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,279
programs and we had even different

595
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:14,539
phases for example reported answered and

596
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:17,659
fixed and also text for vulnerability

597
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:19,460
types so if we found an prasad scripting

598
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:23,809
vulnerability we looked at up in our

599
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:25,580
forum and if we find for example the

600
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:27,649
same content management system on a

601
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:31,220
different end point we can really look

602
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:33,709
that up so we have yeah kind of a forum

603
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:38,359
where everything is collected at one

604
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,369
point not not just randomly sharing some

605
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:43,699
screenshots but also really have

606
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:46,549
everything and at one point that was

607
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:49,580
really great at that time the

608
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:52,999
coordination was also done via the forum

609
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,799
at some point and for us it was always

610
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:57,070
very important to not answer twice but

611
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,408
keep everyone updated out there and

612
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:03,800
nowadays those tasks are mainly done by

613
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:05,600
back party platforms at beginning

614
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,399
that was pretty hard because you

615
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,530
reported something sometimes you were

616
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,080
not even able to look in the back report

617
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:14,960
and this really improved a lot I mean

618
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,000
there are also very fancy right apps out

619
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,280
there we also have a linked list for

620
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,550
ourselves and I think it's also

621
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,740
accessible from the Internet where we

622
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:28,129
shared very interesting research so

623
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:31,670
today our forum is not it's no longer a

624
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:33,740
news so yeah we shifted that's to for

625
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:37,640
example the Easter pet and things like

626
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:41,540
that then how we managed our rewards and

627
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:44,030
costs some people say when it comes to

628
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:47,480
money is a friendship ends or something

629
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:49,340
like that but for us it was not really a

630
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,350
big problem because most of the times

631
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,780
you can say okay fifty percent there

632
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:56,899
fifty percent there or something else

633
00:29:53,780 --> 00:30:00,710
for example based on work who found the

634
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:03,770
end points very often it's really not

635
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:06,410
hard to exploit for example a cross-site

636
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:09,530
scripting vulnerability but finding such

637
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:13,430
an endpoint on a subdomain for example

638
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:15,500
and there it might yeah even the end

639
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,630
point who found the end point and he

640
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,450
might get a reward or if you have a

641
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:23,150
fancy bypass or exploit there's also

642
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:25,640
something where we say okay you really

643
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:29,120
did most of the work here so you also

644
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:32,030
get the money of course we also had cost

645
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,939
for tooling domain servers and so on for

646
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:37,120
example our web site must be hosted on

647
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,610
[Music]

648
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:44,239
yeah on web space so that's something

649
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:47,120
where we had kind of shared money if we

650
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,940
have a splitting bounty for example we

651
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,340
decided to keep that in our Indian Baja

652
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,850
dot orc project and reinvest it for

653
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:57,830
example in our tools or the platform it

654
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:01,030
also it's very hard to decide for

655
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:05,720
example who is going into a Hall of Fame

656
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:08,139
most of the times we try it's to get

657
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,060
both people within this Hall of Fame's

658
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,610
as team entered waha most of the cases

659
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:16,270
that also worked if it really was work

660
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:20,500
of one person of course then only one

661
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:23,290
also getting this so that's fine we also

662
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,330
kind of had a problem with swag at some

663
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,340
point because there was only one

664
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:30,760
shipping address so that's something

665
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:34,030
which might be gets improved at the

666
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,770
future but for example you can ship this

667
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:40,510
to one person and share that later

668
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:42,700
that's also fine for us so yeah then we

669
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:45,670
come to personal challenges because

670
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,770
that's also something where you really

671
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,240
have to deal mate for example if you

672
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,070
have different views or different

673
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,140
opinion sometimes it might be really

674
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:56,770
hard but sometimes it also helps you to

675
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,929
wide you of you so yeah it's always

676
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:01,809
interesting to hear another opinion or

677
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:05,400
to think out of the box with the

678
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:08,139
different mindsets that's yeah for me

679
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:11,920
very important to have a certain views

680
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:14,350
on one topic and of course there might

681
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,440
even be a different time management some

682
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:19,510
people are getting up late in the night

683
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,300
and that doing the work other people

684
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:25,179
might do this in the morning and say I

685
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,919
might even be misunderstandings but the

686
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:29,080
most important things about all this

687
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,450
personal challenges is that you talk

688
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,090
about it so a general if you team up you

689
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,280
really should say okay I really have a

690
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:39,459
problem if we are doing this and that

691
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,920
and then you as a team have to look okay

692
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:45,820
how can we deal with it who is doing

693
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:49,179
what and why and is it really helpful to

694
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:53,379
do this as a team or do we do this as

695
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:56,050
individuals for example that's yeah some

696
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:58,179
saying you should always consider when

697
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:00,399
you report a certain back or doing

698
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:02,800
certain research do we want to do this

699
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,880
research together or is everybody doing

700
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,360
this on their own

701
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,850
what's the advantage and disadvantage so

702
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,189
there have also been challenges with bug

703
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,649
bounty programs or bug bounty platforms

704
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:18,750
at first for us

705
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,750
mostly it's not intended for teams

706
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:24,489
that's that's our point of view because

707
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:26,919
most of the platforms yeah kind of have

708
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:29,020
this idea this one researcher out there

709
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,170
who is doing some research and reporting

710
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,960
certain parks

711
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:36,050
it's not like for example on github

712
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,830
where different people working on one

713
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:42,678
project and checking in code that's kind

714
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:46,550
of different so there might be

715
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:48,830
improvement in the future then we also

716
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:51,230
had some problems regarding two-factor

717
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,210
authentication it always depends what

718
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,750
kind of cool factor authentication is it

719
00:33:53,210 --> 00:34:02,690
used but for example if you use SMS or

720
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:06,650
email or TOTP yet you really have to

721
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:09,350
know okay which device has which secret

722
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:12,139
key and can we share it for example with

723
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:14,480
SMS tokens it's kind of hard there might

724
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,850
be a service for that if you know this

725
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,000
let me know in the comments I would be

726
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:21,679
really interested in that and of course

727
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,918
another problem might be ID verification

728
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,639
so who is really behind this account can

729
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:31,668
we as a team have one account or how do

730
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,659
we share certain findings things like

731
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:38,899
that's non-disclosure agreements so are

732
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:42,250
you allowed to look in a certain program

733
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:45,679
as a teammate and how to make sure that

734
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:48,918
everybody sticks to this NDA if just one

735
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:53,600
person accepted it so that's kind of a

736
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:58,040
gray field and in the public programs we

737
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:01,089
really stick to this and the ACE and of

738
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:04,460
course also regarding the private NDA

739
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:06,380
programs but it's yeah sometimes kind of

740
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,350
hard to do this kind of account sharing

741
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:12,980
in German and then also tools for teams

742
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:15,920
with that I mean that for example some

743
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:19,910
platforms could provide these are pets

744
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,250
or even a collaboration feature so that

745
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:25,129
would be really nice if we might see

746
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,600
this in the future otherwise most of the

747
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,940
teams have to create their own

748
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,730
infrastructure for doing this and it

749
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:34,040
could be really helpful if people people

750
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,940
from the same region or country really

751
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,609
could

752
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:41,390
yeah gets together into one bug bounty

753
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:43,190
program and just share certain findings

754
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:46,190
or even tools together

755
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:48,890
what changes we love to see in the

756
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:51,230
future for example more teams as far as

757
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:53,629
I know there are not that many teams out

758
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:55,310
there sometimes you see people on

759
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,640
Twitter who are really sharing the

760
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:04,310
knowledge for example teams Sweden with

761
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,960
France and Matthias Carson I think so

762
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,509
that's really great as there are people

763
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,180
who are working as a team we love to see

764
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:14,710
this and we also would like to love

765
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:17,660
better teams so who are really focusing

766
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,760
mostly dealing with background programs

767
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,190
as a team and not as an individual and

768
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,170
also this kind of team functionalities

769
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:26,470
on background review platforms

770
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,760
as mentioned before like on github

771
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,700
organizations or something like that and

772
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:37,160
even more support for researchers like

773
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:39,169
tooling or certain domains yeah

774
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,620
reservations for researchers or teams

775
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:46,130
that would be very nice from our point

776
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:47,870
of view so in general what we have

777
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,860
learned from the past teaming up has

778
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:54,020
really helped us a lot and get us where

779
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:58,070
we are today has given us a lot of

780
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:00,740
opportunities taught us a lot and it has

781
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:04,280
given us advantages over individual bug

782
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:06,259
bounty hunting or hunters sometimes it's

783
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,820
tough for example designing on boundary

784
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,870
splits deciding who's in the Hall of

785
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:14,060
Fame who gets Evie's interviews and

786
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:17,390
investing an equal amount of time also

787
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:19,970
can be very challenging depending on who

788
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,770
is doing what so yeah

789
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:24,620
that's also something you should

790
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,330
consider and sometimes you also have

791
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,980
this kind of communication overhead for

792
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,020
example you wrote an email and then you

793
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,420
have to write your teammates that you

794
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:35,600
wrote an email or he has to look it up

795
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:38,960
within the email box or was in certain

796
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,819
chat but yeah that's fine for us and we

797
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,460
are really happy to be there as a team

798
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,650
so yeah we are still there we are happy

799
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:48,020
about the future about the path and we

800
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:51,050
are still good friends so yeah teaming

801
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,600
up really is great I also hope that this

802
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,670
talk might be an inspiration for people

803
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,250
teaming up and

804
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:01,099
getting even better reports out there so

805
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:04,250
reporting those on various platforms or

806
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:05,960
to the back party platforms and if you

807
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,480
look for example at the professional

808
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:12,380
field of IT security you also see that a

809
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,660
lot of teams very often there are not

810
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:17,059
individuals to really put work forward

811
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:20,868
but yeah different people with different

812
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:22,880
mindsets and that's also I think where

813
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:25,760
the back ecology community might head

814
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,180
into so that would be really great from

815
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,700
our point of view so general that was

816
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:34,520
our talk I hope you enjoyed it we're

817
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:37,819
happy to answer your question I also

818
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:41,000
have YouTube chat here so if you have a

819
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:43,970
question how we deal yet just answer

820
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,960
just that just ask it I will answer it

821
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:51,379
and I will be also on the back crowd

822
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:53,569
this court channel after this talk so if

823
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,750
you have questions you can contact us by

824

so yeah thank you very much and with

826
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:05,150
this I would hand over to Sam and maybe

827
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:08,240
there are also some questions from the

828
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:10,339
community out there um great job great

829
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,899
job thank you so much for that talk that

830
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:19,490
was awesome yeah everyone in the chat

831
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:21,290
throw in your questions or or any sort

832
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:24,680
of comments let's see I know I saw a

833
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:27,529
question earlier earlier in the talk

834
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,140
that someone was asking you know how

835
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,910
should i how do I meet people and

836
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,220
obviously it might be different for your

837
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:36,049
personal situation but I I was wondering

838
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,970
if you had any sort of general advice on

839
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:42,470
how to meet people that would be good to

840
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:45,078
team up with yeah that's also a question

841
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:48,109
where a lot of young people who are yeah

842
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:51,049
for example in our in my lecture so I'm

843
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:53,420
giving talks at University for example

844
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:56,089
and a lot of people should say okay how

845
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:00,680
can i yeah get really get into this

846
00:39:56,089 --> 00:40:03,078
community and yes it's really hard or

847
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,270
not so easy to answer question because

848
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,920
it really depends on the individual but

849
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,310
in general there are a lot of

850
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,430
conferences for example out there

851
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:14,830
yeah just go to some conference or look

852
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,480
for certain projects online talk to

853
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:20,190
those people that can be really helpful

854
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:25,450
and if there's a hackerspace for example

855
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:28,300
in a city next to you or even clap for

856
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:30,970
hackers that's also some point where I

857
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:35,290
think most of the people can really get

858
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:37,180
into finding teammates and making

859
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,759
friendship with other hackers that's

860
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:43,270
really a very important thing I think

861
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,880
it's also good for yeah kind of the yeah

862
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,740
mental health that you have some people

863
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,730
to exchange because this kind of bug

864
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:54,790
bounty hunting sometimes it can be

865
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,840
really hard so that you're just sitting

866
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,820
at your desk and look for

867
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,160
vulnerabilities within web application

868
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,140
so this social component and exchange

869
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,879
with others is really important I

870
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:12,069
totally agree that's great advice let's

871
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,750
see here we had well we had the let's

872
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,150
see we had a couple typical questions

873
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,620
around like what hacking tools you use

874
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,290
but I want to see if we also have

875
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:23,710
anything about collaboration or teaming

876
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:25,990
let's see yeah I I thought that there

877
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:29,350
was one person who asked about this

878
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:32,080
Faraday kind of thing from info pile oh

879
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:36,339
yeah yeah that's right on kidnap a thing

880
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:39,730
I did not know this before so yeah we

881
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:43,030
might look at that but yeah at this part

882
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:44,740
no we did not know that but there are

883
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,290
also other tools who are more

884
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,600
integrating this kind of collaboration

885
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:52,630
things so yeah it's really interesting

886
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,700
to see that there are some tools who

887
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:57,880
will now also adapt this kind of

888
00:41:54,700 --> 00:42:00,009
collaboration features because even yeah

889
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,260
most of the pen testing companies have

890
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:04,180
this kind of problem so that there are

891
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:07,420
not individual researchers but there

892
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:09,549
have to do for example an assessment as

893
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:16,170
a team so it's really interesting to see

894
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:19,090
houses products or tools and proof nice

895
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:21,510
we had a question in the YouTube chat

896
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:25,950
from Samuel

897
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:28,890
which a nice name they asked can can

898
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:31,500
complete noobs be any useful in hacking

899
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:35,520
collaboration so yeah if you're more

900
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,950
experienced person would you get used

901
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,990
from someone that's newer and how would

902
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:43,580
that newer person maybe try to provide

903
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:46,709
some value yeah as I mentioned before

904
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:49,259
everybody starts somewhere and this idea

905
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:53,640
to say okay you're a complete noob is

906
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:56,310
yeah kind of very hard but I think it's

907
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:00,359
important to integrate those people or

908
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:03,509
also yeah tell them things or share your

909
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:06,690
research because otherwise they might

910
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:10,220
not get to this next level and the

911
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:12,960
question regarding can they be useful

912
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,700
it's always a question for whom I think

913
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,920
it's important for the security

914
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:20,009
community to have new people within this

915
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,880
field because a lot of threats out there

916
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:26,040
so yeah you call them loops there might

917
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,230
be the next security professionals in

918
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,660
the future so it's really important also

919
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:33,990
to talk to those people and give them an

920
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:37,589
idea share for example yeah YouTube

921
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:41,399
channels or tutorials with them and yeah

922
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:43,680
if they are qualified and yeah some way

923
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,440
or can help you with some tasks why not

924
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,960
so yeah that's something I would say

925
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,080
integrates those people it's important

926
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,220
to us to have souls

927
00:43:51,080 --> 00:44:02,430
great great great all right let's see

928
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:05,930
what else is coming here this is an

929
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:12,690
interesting question from mohamed kaiser

930
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:14,160
he asked while you're collaborating what

931
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,760
is the information that you shouldn't

932
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:21,000
share with your team with your teammate

933
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:23,790
what we shouldn't share yeah so mainly a

934
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,440
tendon why how we really share most of

935
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:28,200
the details but of course for example

936
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,170
Sebastian and I are also doing

937
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:34,919
penetration tests as private individuals

938
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:38,040
or freelancers so if you have an NDA

939
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:42,240
that's really something where you are

940
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:45,150
not able to share informations but if

941
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,799
you say for example to a person who came

942
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:49,619
to you and say please do this for

943
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:51,750
ability test and you say okay I will do

944
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:53,760
this with the teammate and we also have

945
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,520
an NDA and things like that then this

946
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,970
might be okay but yeah you really should

947
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:02,160
stick to the hoots there and yeah for me

948
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:04,490
it's passed everything I've said and I

949
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,618
think the best term would say the same

950
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:09,899
was fine but yeah of course you should

951
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:13,619
think about this if you have your super

952
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:16,710
duper exploit then yeah it's sometimes

953
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:19,680
hard to decide whether you share it or

954
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:22,520
not but in general for example our

955
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,160
research about dot Jia store files

956
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:28,559
really was a great thing and we also

957
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,520
shared this with the community so that's

958
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,280
good for everybody

959
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:38,849
and I would also love to see other

960
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:41,040
people sharing their ideas there was

961
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:42,839
just a good question that came in so

962
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,009
earlier we talked about like how to meet

963
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:50,040
people but how do you think that you can

964
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:52,349
accomplish or sorry how do you think you

965
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,520
can create that that trust between those

966
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:56,369
two people that you're gonna need

967
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,079
because you are splitting you know

968
00:45:56,369 --> 00:45:59,460
you're splitting money not only that but

969
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,559
everything else that you're splitting

970
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,809
work and all this other stuff so yeah

971
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,369
how do you what do you suggest to kind

972
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:09,780
of build trust between someone that you

973
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:12,450
might be just meeting online yeah the

974
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,970
funny thing is Sebastian and I also met

975
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:16,558
on conferences and online and at the

976
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:19,589
beginning for example you don't have a

977
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:23,760
very big trust so trust really needs

978
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:26,940
time and I would also not say okay just

979
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,440
team up and tomorrow you are the weakest

980
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:30,750
or greatest team and share everything

981
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,420
together you really should be careful

982
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:36,119
for example also met these people in

983
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:38,670
person we need talk a lot have used the

984
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:41,010
same vision the same ideas and then you

985
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:44,490
can decide step by step what you want to

986
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:47,790
do and what to achieve not only for back

987
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:48,578
bounty hunting but in general so that's

988
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,199
really

989
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:53,410
yeah a part I would say is that you have

990
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:58,359
a step-by-step trust level I would call

991
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:59,920
it a nice let's see well I mean we did

992
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:02,499
get those questions earlier about oh

993
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,019
sorry Jason don't worry I decided

994
00:47:02,499 --> 00:47:09,368
question subs I played in a lot of CPS

995
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:11,339
and playing CTF it feels very similar to

996
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:13,809
how do I want to collaborate on on

997
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:15,910
bogdani it would you suggest what people

998
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:17,979
play a couple CTS per team to get the

999
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,410
seal of kind of how that works for

1000
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:22,269
sharing information with other people

1001
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:25,839
yeah of course playing CTF really is a

1002
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:29,198
great thing to learn more about each

1003
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,569
other how you focus on challenges and

1004
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:35,380
how you really can work together to

1005
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:38,499
improve your yourself and also yes the

1006
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,979
team so that's really great we also for

1007
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:45,189
example collaborated in CPS and had even

1008
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:48,399
an own CTF for the community I think

1009
00:47:45,189 --> 00:47:50,799
it's three years ago or something like

1010
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:56,140
that but that was also very great so

1011
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:59,410
yeah playing CTS or even doing some yeah

1012
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:02,259
laps stuff like that or implementing a

1013
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:05,920
project or website together that's yeah

1014
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:08,769
really nice to learn each other or learn

1015
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,779
from each other yeah very cool you don't

1016
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:13,718
have to focus on hacking at the

1017
00:48:10,779 --> 00:48:17,140
beginning but just yeah doing things

1018
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:19,089
together and hex stuff yeah have fun

1019
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,368
together that's really great I would say

1020
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:23,439
yeah and the stakes are I mean obviously

1021
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:25,209
if there's like the winning of the CTF

1022
00:48:23,439 --> 00:48:26,709
or whatever that's on the line but the

1023
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:29,439
stakes are a lot lower than I guess

1024
00:48:26,709 --> 00:48:35,759
hacking for money when you have to kind

1025
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:35,759
of deal with all that drama yeah

1026
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,040
I guess what I was gonna say earlier is

1027
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:48,049
we could indulge some people earlier

1028
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,840
we're asking about the hacking tools

1029
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:53,840
that you guys use you you went through a

1030
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:56,330
lot of the collaboration tools and you

1031
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:00,590
have given many technical talks so I do

1032
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:04,670
encourage our listeners or our viewers

1033
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:06,650
to google you guys and find a lot of

1034
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:10,760
stuff that you've done with bugcrowd but

1035
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:13,220
also elsewhere but yeah I guess

1036
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,160
while we have we have a handful of

1037
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:19,009
minutes you could talk about if there's

1038
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:24,049
any like particular tools that you guys

1039
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:27,170
like the yeah of course burp is or

1040
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:29,960
general yeah hacking tool for web

1041
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:32,980
applications at least and we are also

1042
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,570
having our own tools so that's also very

1043
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,550
interesting singing if you are working

1044
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:40,360
as a team you can really share your

1045
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:43,310
Python scripts we have an own repository

1046
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:47,150
where we check in tools also the get

1047
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:48,980
tool you can find on our github site was

1048
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:51,140
an internal tool at the beginning and

1049
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:53,660
then we really decided to put it out

1050
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:56,779
there because it's really a contribution

1051
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:59,899
to the community the same we also did

1052
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:04,010
with a DES parser which is out there so

1053
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:06,920
yeah of course our own tools and also

1054
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:10,850
yeah like the standard tools you also

1055
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:14,000
saw yesterday on this channel on the

1056
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:17,390
level up conference certain tools so

1057
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,690
there is no super duper top secret tool

1058
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:25,609
and sometimes I also think the question

1059
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:28,160
about tools yeah really is also hard but

1060
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:30,980
sometimes it's not about the tools it's

1061
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:34,819
more how you yeah get on to a program

1062
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:39,050
exactly yeah totally agree I think I

1063
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:40,760
think as beginners in anything but

1064
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:42,800
especially hacking you're always kind of

1065
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,840
searching for this thing that's kind of

1066
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,650
gonna give you that leg up you know

1067
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:51,079
finally kind of unlock things and it's

1068
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:53,779
not always the tools it's the mess

1069
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:54,410
theology or you know the steps that you

1070
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:58,940
go through

1071
00:50:54,410 --> 00:51:03,499
on that note actually when you guys

1072
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:05,569
start hacking on a target how long do

1073
00:51:03,499 --> 00:51:10,640
you spend on a on a bug-type

1074
00:51:05,569 --> 00:51:12,589
someone was asking in chat it was an AI

1075
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,479
project I think is their name they're

1076
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:16,759
asking like for instance if you were

1077
00:51:14,479 --> 00:51:21,468
looking for AI doors how long would you

1078
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:25,670
look for an IDE or before moving on also

1079
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:27,799
very hard to answer this directly it

1080
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:30,319
really depends on the functionality of

1081
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:32,569
the website a few things there could be

1082
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:36,469
some things and it's really a good thing

1083
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:39,049
to stick at some yeah kind of

1084
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:41,869
vulnerability for example an ID or then

1085
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:44,509
you can decide doing this for kind of

1086
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:46,459
one hour and if you say okay we don't

1087
00:51:44,509 --> 00:51:48,950
find anything today that's also fine

1088
00:51:46,459 --> 00:51:50,930
then you can put this into your backlog

1089
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,529
for example we are doing this with our

1090
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,618
etherpad

1091
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:58,190
if we have some endpoint which is a bit

1092
00:51:54,619 --> 00:52:00,170
fishy to us then we focus on that and if

1093
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:04,459
we are not able to find anything that

1094
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:07,219
gets into our backlog so yeah in general

1095
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:10,190
two answers time this is really hard

1096
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:11,779
part yeah focusing on things is also

1097
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:13,819
very important and if you know for

1098
00:52:11,779 --> 00:52:17,259
example that your teammate or teammates

1099
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:20,359
is really good on one topic for example

1100
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:22,039
by passing some filters or something

1101
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:25,009
like that then you really should mark

1102
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:29,930
this for your teammates so it can always

1103
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:31,999
be helpful if you stick or yeah stack at

1104
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:35,989
some points and another person might

1105
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:37,999
help you with that yeah Haddix just left

1106
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:40,400
a good comment and chat I mean he's on

1107
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:43,339
here so he can elaborate if he wants to

1108
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,969
but um he's he's making a good point and

1109
00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:48,589
and this kind of points to Jason's other

1110
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:51,190
presentations about a hacking

1111
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:54,170
methodology where it's not necessarily

1112
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:56,390
with how he hacks it's not necessarily

1113
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:58,069
looking for I doors and just like going

1114
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:01,069
all over the place looking for I doors

1115
00:52:58,069 --> 00:53:03,200
he's looking more through all the

1116
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:04,940
targets all of the different

1117
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,250
points that you're come across and

1118
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,809
you're looking for stuff that's

1119
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:12,589
interesting potential opportunities and

1120
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:14,480
then you look for the bugs that are you

1121
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:17,029
know potentially available to you in

1122
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,339
that and those opportunities right so if

1123
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:21,140
you find a login page for example that's

1124
00:53:19,339 --> 00:53:22,940
going to be different from another page

1125
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:28,940
that might have other different types of

1126
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:31,280
functionality yeah in general for the as

1127
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:34,309
Jason mentioned if you find something

1128
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:39,619
interesting always stick to this because

1129
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:42,109
if there's an unknown behavior then it

1130
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:44,930
might be a vulnerability or even might

1131
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:47,660
be something is a owner of a program

1132
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:50,210
might be interested in but of course you

1133
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:52,790
really have to read the rules and know

1134
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:54,920
what they are interested in and then

1135
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:56,690
document all those things we also had

1136
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,760
some cases where we really had something

1137
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:00,440
in our backlog and then we looked it up

1138
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,680
again and then we found a vulnerability

1139
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:09,020
in there so it's always helpful to

1140
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:11,000
really not just have one or twenty tabs

1141
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:13,069
open in your browser but also writing

1142
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,170
down on documenting what you are doing

1143
00:54:13,069 --> 00:54:18,259
and why you're doing is especially if

1144
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:20,839
you work as a team because if you work

1145
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:22,880
together as a person's might not know

1146
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:25,058
what you have tested there and it's

1147
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,160
really important to share this so

1148
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:30,799
everybody is able to spot

1149
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:34,250
vulnerabilities very efficiently so yeah

1150
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:36,770
I do do a little bit of testing with um

1151
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:39,740
with some students of mine who earned my

1152
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:42,319
bug hunting classes and one thing I

1153
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:46,399
would I would caution people is I tend

1154
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:48,829
to want to like horde the like exploit

1155
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,420
or bug like location or endpoint or

1156
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:52,640
something like that and so like I'm I'm

1157
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,440
pretty much out of options which is

1158
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,359
actually not useful so I found that

1159
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,950
working with you know my students that

1160
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:00,380
earlier I informed them that something

1161
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:01,848
is interesting even if I think I'll be

1162
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,410
able to exploit it on my own I've

1163
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:05,660
accepted the fact that we're going to

1164
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:07,670
work in a team anyway and probably over

1165
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:10,220
the session of our you know are like the

1166
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:11,780
the long term of our agreement and the

1167
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,640
you know of how we're going to work

1168
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:15,740
together I pretty much know in my head

1169
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,058
that the money is going to get equalized

1170
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,038
between both of us anyway

1171
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:22,219
so saving the time is actually what I

1172
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:23,989
care about and so earlier talking to

1173
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:27,259
your partner your or your students or

1174
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:29,239
whoever is actually better in the long

1175
00:55:27,259 --> 00:55:30,289
run so save that time and whoever gets

1176
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:31,429
it first it doesn't really matter

1177
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:33,049
because you're gonna you know you're

1178
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:36,199
gonna actually it between the two or

1179
00:55:33,049 --> 00:55:41,089
three of you anyway so yeah yeah I

1180
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:43,189
totally agree with that so really really

1181
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:45,799
shutting together for example and not

1182
00:55:43,189 --> 00:55:47,509
just writing is also seeing for example

1183
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:48,799
in our hunting sessions it's really

1184
00:55:47,509 --> 00:55:51,949
important that you talk to each other

1185
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:54,529
and also sing out loud so if you are at

1186
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:56,509
a certain end point and you tell your

1187
00:55:54,529 --> 00:55:58,640
teammate what you're doing that's yeah

1188
00:55:56,509 --> 00:56:01,519
really great and this exchange really is

1189
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,650
important so yeah thank you very much

1190
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:07,479
for having me I will be on sir discord

1191
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:07,479
later so if we have questions left
