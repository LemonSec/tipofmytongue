um you have your talk here is forget me

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,480
remember we how to hack better with a

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,790
group I love that this presentation will

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,439
cover best practices to finding a group

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,110
of skilled colleagues to work together

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,450
in teams to maximize skills against a

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,149
target John will provide some background

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,220
some tips and tricks on how to best find

11
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,260
others who can help what to look for in

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,720
potential teammates best practices and

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,199
working together and tools and tricks to

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,610
help maximized teamwork and he had even

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,560
more in there but I had to kind of cram

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,910
it down there so John's got a lot of

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,610
great information that he's going to

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,260
share with you real quick in this 30

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,970
minute segment so take it away John

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,930
thank you so much for joining us thank

21
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:01,230
you Jason and I apologize to everybody I

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,090
got a the flu right now so if my voice

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,899
sounds really funny sorry

24
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,140
read the slides okay so today we're

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,670
going to kind of talk about how to work

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:15,149
really as a team which is what this

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,880
level up session for was really about

28
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:20,690
how you could be better when you

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,690
collaborate with

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,290
yep there we go

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,869
so I can't hit space great so a little

32
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,810
bit about me I'm actually a little bit

33
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:39,820
different than most hackers I'm actually

34
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:42,190
a lawyer so I read contract the law you

35
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:46,479
could say but at the same time I do pen

36
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:49,090
test I do network audits and that's kind

37
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,009
of a hobby to me so one of the things

38
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,360
that you can start off is you don't have

39
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:54,880
to think that you have to have a

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,470
computer background to really get into

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,839
this industry and I'll jump a little bit

42
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,240
more into that later because the more

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,030
well-rounded of a team you have

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,429
sometimes you can find stuff that you

45
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:10,750
would not normally catch if you just

46
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:12,670
really focused on computers I train and

47
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,720
consult for various governments and

48
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,970
fortune 100 companies so we'll we'll

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,700
leave that to questions if you want to

50
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:24,640
know exactly what I do this is more for

51
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,670
me to show you something versus me and I

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,350
really enjoy breaking things so

53
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,988
hopefully I can show you how you can

54
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,900
break the mindset of you have to do it

55
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:42,940
yourself you can actually now do it with

56
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:45,670
others so a lot of what I'm going to

57
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,579
talk about today it's really nothing new

58
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:51,010
today I want to just kind of reiterate

59
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:53,980
some very common things so that you can

60
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,380
understand that hey this is okay a lot

61
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,140
of times and I remember when I started

62
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,230
out in the industry ten eleven years ago

63
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,290
I was really afraid I was like well this

64
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,600
kind of seems maybe right but I've not

65
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,900
heard anybody else say it so I don't

66
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,560
know so instead of teaching you like a

67
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,980
new O'Day or how to do amazing things on

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,260
zapper WASC tools today I'm just gonna

69
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,899
kind of give you some very simple common

70
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,420
knowledge but at the same time I hope it

71
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,810
now sparks you to go oh hey I thought

72
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:32,280
that was okay so now somebody else said

73
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,280
it great I can do it too

74
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:42,930
I'm gonna start off by talking about a

75
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:45,630
group that really made me surprised I

76
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,060
spent a couple of years in Kenya working

77
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:52,109
and so I worked with the Africa hack on

78
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,710
collective it's a group of computer

79
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:59,850
professionals and they really idealized

80
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:02,130
what is a good team mentality they had

81
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,109
people who specialized in web app they

82
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,600
had people who specialized in network

83
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,250
they had people who did social

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,760
engineering they had somebody who

85
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:15,390
specialized in GSM hacking they had

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,238
people for mobile app so they had a wide

87
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:21,779
variety so when a client came to them

88
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:25,830
and said hey I need you to do a pen test

89
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:28,320
on my network and can you also test my

90
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,979
mobile application they had the skill

91
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,380
set right there working with these guys

92
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,290
in Kenya it was amazing it opened my

93
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:41,280
eyes to see that so many different

94
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,860
aspects of security could easily overlap

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,619
with each other prior to working with

96
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,420
the Africa hack on team I was really

97
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,230
concerned because I was more of a

98
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:56,550
network person I loved to pen test I

99
00:04:52,230 --> 00:05:01,100
loved to break into a server I love to

100
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:04,260
to break things as I said earlier but

101
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,390
working with these individuals like saw

102
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,940
that some of the skills that I did from

103
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,950
a network perspective we're also very

104
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,969
useful in mobile applications for

105
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:18,420
instance our GSM hacking and so it was

106
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,240
like oh great thank you for opening my

107
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:25,460
eyes and let me see that even though I

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,630
focus on one thing I can spend time and

109
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,859
start to learn something else because a

110
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,020
lot of the skills overlap

111
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,240
often when I speak to people in the

112
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,330
industry when I speak at conferences or

113
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,480
I go to different events many people

114
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,820
focus on I want to do one thing so that

115
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,910
could be I want to only focus on bug

116
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:52,940
bounty or I only want to focus on mobile

117
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:55,700
app testing but in reality don't focus

118
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:58,219
yourself so narrow you can try to

119
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,860
broaden out into different aspects the

120
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,820
more well-rounded you are the better of

121
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:07,970
a of a bug bounty person are an attacker

122
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:10,969
or a blue team member or even purple

123
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,100
team for those that do both the more

124
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,990
world well-rounded you are the better

125
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:21,670
you're going to be in the role that you

126
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:25,490
are doing we're gonna first start off on

127
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:28,340
how do we find others because that is

128
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,910
one of the key problems a lot of people

129
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,500
don't understand how can I collaborate

130
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,750
Philip's talked earlier was great

131
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,900
all throughout yesterday and today

132
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:41,240
you've heard for many people saying

133
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,909
working together does work it does help

134
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,390
so I'm gonna go over to some very key

135
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:50,890
points on how you can find others what

136
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:53,450
you should look for and how not to do it

137
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,340
I've been approached by many people

138
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,789
throughout the years asking just like

139
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:02,090
Philip had can you be a mentor to me can

140
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:05,120
you train me can you teach me I really

141
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,750
want to do this but sometimes those

142
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,460
people are either a little too

143
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:14,000
enthusiastic or they're just a little

144
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:17,630
too pushy and that that's really not

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,640
good in the industry yes a lot of the

146
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,100
industry people are really forthcoming

147
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:26,090
they're really open you can easily

148
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:28,400
message like Jason or Sam on Twitter and

149
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,359
they'll get back to you same for like

150
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:36,560
Jason Street or other leaders of the

151
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,320
industry so with that in mind when

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,430
you're looking for others the best thing

153
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:46,790
is just ask really don't be shy

154
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:50,270
um I had that problem I remember the

155
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:54,950
first conference that I went to way back

156
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:56,659
in early 2000 and even though I had been

157
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,479
doing it on my own for many years I

158
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:02,840
wanted to kind of jump into the industry

159
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:05,450
better and say hey can I meet new people

160
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,609
and I stood at the back of the

161
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:10,490
conference hall and I just stood there I

162
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,900
didn't talk to anybody I was scared too

163
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:16,010
because I was seeing all of these people

164
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:19,580
that I had read on Twitter or I had seen

165
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:22,870
present online and I'm just like I froze

166
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:26,270
I didn't want to talk to anybody that

167
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,460
was the wrong move I found everybody

168
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,010
there was so welcoming so when I finally

169
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,240
went over and said hello to somebody the

170
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,980
first thing they did was started

171
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,720
introducing me to everybody else around

172
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:41,870
that they knew this is our industry

173
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,330
everybody is open or well not everybody

174
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,660
but most people are open they're willing

175
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:50,930
to help they want to help they want to

176
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:54,110
give back so just don't be shy go up to

177
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:58,790
somebody and say hi my name is whatever

178
00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:00,620
I am new or I don't know how to do a

179
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,620
mobile app pen test but I heard your

180
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:07,640
talk can you please explain or give me

181
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:12,200
some ideal everybody here wants to see

182
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,510
the industry grow we want to see you get

183
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,550
better bounties when you're on bugcrowd

184
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:20,330
we want to see that you do better things

185
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:24,800
if you're working on some open-source

186
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:26,960
tools are making your own tool also go

187
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,260
to security group meetings go to

188
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,930
different conferences go to events the

189
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:36,410
more that you get out and the more that

190
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:38,680
you get known then it's easier to find

191
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,959
people that you want to collaborate with

192
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:47,269
the first time I had to do a major pen

193
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:50,089
test of a very large scale organization

194
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:53,839
I was terrified because they gave me a

195
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:56,690
very small window of time to complete

196
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,820
the testing

197
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,430
and there was no way I could do that on

198
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,220
my own I was lucky to get the contract

199
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,260
but I was then once we were scoping it

200
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,990
it was like oh my god I can't do this

201
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,720
this is way too much what am I gonna do

202
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:16,300
what am I gonna do what am I gonna do so

203
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,650
I went to a local security meeting and

204
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,640
the people that I knew there I was like

205
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:25,189
oh hey you specialize in this or you're

206
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,270
very good at that would you guys want to

207
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,920
help me on this project and we all can

208
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,439
make a little bit of pocket money and

209
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,380
everybody was like yeah great it looks

210
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,150
good for resumes so most people will

211
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,070
jump out and say okay yeah I want to

212
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:44,840
help are it's a way that they can learn

213
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:48,040
something new also engaging constructive

214
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,570
online post chats like Twitter our

215
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,390
discord the key word here is

216
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:56,750
constructive don't just sit there and be

217
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:58,490
negative or troll the whole time which

218
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,650
is funny coming from me because if you

219
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,870
ask anybody in the industry that knows

220
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:06,590
me I'm probably one of the biggest

221
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:09,400
trolls and so I will troll you on

222
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:12,140
Twitter I will troll you at a conference

223
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,780
I was at a security conference in

224
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,689
Singapore maybe four or five years ago

225
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,670
now and I hacked the whole conference

226
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,200
and i trolled people throughout the

227
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:25,699
whole conference because I took control

228
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:29,740
of the Wi-Fi and had a blast just

229
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:32,320
messing with people so

230
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,810
don't be me is what I'm saying try to be

231
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,940
constructive jump in on talks where

232
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,250
people are asking being like well it's a

233
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:44,320
new tool to use or how could I do

234
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:46,960
something be able to show what little

235
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,460
skill or what vast amount of skill you

236
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:54,430
have you want to kind of say hey I know

237
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,260
this but I don't know that can you help

238
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,670
me learn that or can you help me with

239
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,890
that and another good way to really get

240
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,439
where you meet a lot of people that are

241
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,630
wanting to help and would love to

242
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,600
collaborate with you is to contribute on

243
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:13,720
an open-source security project if you

244
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,090
are a coder which I find a lot of people

245
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:21,040
doing bug bounties they do have a coding

246
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:25,030
background jump and try to write some

247
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,400
code for like a wasp tools or try to fix

248
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,520
a problem that you might see if you're

249
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:34,720
using Metasploit or write a module for

250
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:37,210
Metasploit doing this you'll see that

251
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,960
overnight you'll have so many people

252
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:42,790
that are like hey great job can you help

253
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,660
me with this or can I help you

254
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:49,719
do something your group of people that

255
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:53,079
you can then call on become so huge

256
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,630
almost overnight I don't have a coding

257
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:59,020
background and so often I have to go to

258
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:02,170
people that I know and I say hey I've

259
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:05,640
got something in Java can you take a

260
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:10,510
look at it because I don't write Java

261
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:13,780
and I've been able to find these people

262
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,720
because I have contributed on some open

263
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:20,709
source projects and so I know who then

264
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,520
to go to to kind of look at okay

265
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,520
can you help me

266
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:30,269
how not to find out there's this is

267
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:33,599
actually one of probably the best things

268
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:35,459
I hope you pay attention to I as I said

269
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,350
and even Philip said earlier like many

270
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:42,660
people come to him and they offer him

271
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:45,149
money to train same with me don't just

272
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,890
think money is our motivation a lot of

273
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:50,399
people in industry they will help you

274
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:53,490
because they want to help you they they

275
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,040
like to help get everybody in the

276
00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:00,240
industry better and more well equipped

277
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,219
so as I put on the slide don't pester

278
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,620
don't if somebody doesn't answer

279
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,089
immediately don't go crazy don't

280
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,920
threaten to hack them don't be a

281
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:14,570
nuisance I guess is the best way to sum

282
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,339
this up I've had people come to me and

283
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:20,940
one example that I remember very vividly

284
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:25,339
to this day a gentleman asked me to help

285
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:27,930
him learn how to do a internal pin test

286
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:30,959
versus an external because he had only

287
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,489
done external before and so I was

288
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,130
willing to help him and I told him I'm

289
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:39,000
quite busy right now I will come back to

290
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:41,670
you in a day or two and we can sit down

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,380
get on a conference call and I'll walk

292
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,110
you through what I do when I do an

293
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:50,040
internal pin test versus what I do when

294
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:52,410
I do an external about two hours later

295
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,890
he started messaging me hey why haven't

296
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:58,880
you responded why are you just not

297
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,880
answering my questions

298
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,949
three hours after that he then started

299
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:09,800
threatening I will Docs you I will hack

300
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:13,440
you you need to help train me yeah now

301
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:16,020
that's the easiest way to have somebody

302
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,840
block you and just not deal with you and

303
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,930
depending on how well-known they are in

304
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:24,120
the industry they could also start

305
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:27,060
talking and that could be a problem

306
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,340
because once you get a lot of a negative

307
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,930
reputation

308
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:36,600
unfortunately word does travel fast in

309
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:39,329
our industry what to look for in your

310
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,440
potential teammates you can't always

311
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:49,550
have that perfect Rockstar anytime you

312
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:53,820
need so when I'm looking at people I

313
00:15:49,550 --> 00:16:00,229
tend to look for people who compliment

314
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:04,590
my skills I'm good on network attacks

315
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:08,010
but I'm not so good on coding I can

316
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:12,030
write a nasty exploit I did that to pass

317
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:14,910
my OS CP courses for those who are OSAP

318
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,829
you know what I'm talking about but I

319
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:19,020
try to find people who do understand

320
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,030
code better who can look at something

321
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,910
and be able to understand where there is

322
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:26,370
a problem in the syntax so that it can

323
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,620
help me attack I'm not an expert on

324
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,390
mobile apps and so if I need to do

325
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,460
something with a mobile app I will find

326
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,550
somebody that I can work with who is

327
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,560
more of an expert on mobile app so find

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,959
help with there's been many of times

332
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,829
I've reached out to somebody and ask

333
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,380
them for help

334

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:59,130
doing or that's gonna be too much work

337
00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:03,060
that's way too boring can I'll do it as

338
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:07,020
a favor but really I don't want to so if

339
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,280
somebody's excited they're motivated you

340
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,819
will find they make a much better

341
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,250
teammate they are more active they will

342
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:17,270
help where

343
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:20,500
if somebody's not as excited then yeah

344
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:23,089
you might have problems with them

345
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,449
willingness to share or the willingness

346
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:29,270
to learn anytime you work together in a

347
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:31,880
group as a collaboration you should

348
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,789
share talents and skills that you know

349
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,390
and you should want to learn from others

350
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:40,400
as I said with point number one people

351
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,200
that compliment your skills you're

352
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,350
looking for somebody that knows

353
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,320
something that you don't and so you want

354
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,240
to be able to learn from them you want

355
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,000
to be able to share what you do know in

356
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,440
the group I found people who didn't want

357
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,600
to learn they thought they knew

358
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,970
everything they don't make great team

359
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,850
members you want somebody that can

360
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:05,330
communicate when you work as a group you

361
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:07,428
need to be able to to talk and to

362
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,189
explain things because what you're

363
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:11,659
seeing somebody else might not see and

364
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,659
they need to be able to replicate that

365
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:16,010
to do what they need to do and then you

366
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,830
also want to find somebody that has

367
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,900
availability as I said before if

368
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:25,240
somebody's not excited they might be

369
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:29,179
busy oh yeah I'm gonna help you but um

370
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,520
only got one hour this week so if they

371
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,559
have no availability it's gonna be hard

372
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,510
to collaborate that doesn't mean they

373
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,299
have to always be available whenever you

374
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:42,080
call but you do want to have that group

375
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:43,820
that people are available and this isn't

376
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,010
really a necessity but a good point to

377
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:49,189
have you want somebody that can handle

378
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:51,110
stress our prior experience sometimes

379
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,630
when you're doing a bug bounty you're

380
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:57,168
doing a pen test you're doing a

381
00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:01,010
simulated attack it is stressful you've

382
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:04,549
got a tight deadline to meet you need to

383
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:06,590
get something done and if you're just

384
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:09,590
not making the headway that you think

385
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:12,080
you need then you're you're going to get

386
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,168
stressed and that goes for the whole

387
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,570
team so if people have prior experience

388
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:19,909
great they can usually handle that they

389
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:24,010
understand that if not as I said it's

390
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:24,010
not a necessity but it does help

391
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:34,610
tips for working together as a team

392
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:37,560
communicate communicate repeat step one

393
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:40,830
the biggest problem with working as a

394
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,800
team is a lack of communication and it's

395
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:46,710
hard when you go from being the only

396
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,960
person working on a project to now

397
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,540
trying to work with others you need to

398
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,990
learn to communicate and to share and to

399
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,430
really talk a lot of times one of the

400
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,030
best things that I do when I work with a

401
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:02,220
group will all hop on a voice chat that

402
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,889
way we all can talk even though we might

403
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,410
be doing separate things we all can just

404
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:10,530
explain what we're doing and what we're

405
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,630
seeing you want to be able to listen to

406
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:16,020
the whole team don't think that you know

407
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:18,270
everything everybody will have their own

408
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,120
point they might be seeing an attack

409
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:24,780
vector that you're not help train and

410
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,989
learn from each other the more that I

411
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,300
work in a team with other people the

412
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,330
more I do learn I can now reverse a

413
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,190
mobile app because I've worked with

414
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,580
teams who did it and I watched and I

415
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:42,000
learned from them give each member very

416
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:44,429
clear tasks if somebody is to port scan

417
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,220
a certain IP range let them port scan

418
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:49,410
that while somebody else is maybe

419
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,130
looking at open source intelligence

420
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,740
information on LinkedIn and be very

421
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,830
flexible

422
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,990
don't be so rigid where oh I completed

423
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,550
the task that I did so I hadn't do

424
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,160
nothing else until I'm told to do

425
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,740
something again you've got to work

426
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,620
together in a very flexible manner to be

427
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,920
able to get done when you need to get

428
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,649
done you also want to decide ahead of

429
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:21,270
time how to split the payment everybody

430
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:24,090
cares about money so make sure that you

431
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:27,240
you work out ahead are you going to wait

432
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:31,050
it on who contributes more so maybe the

433
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,419
person yeah pause just for one sorry

434
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:38,249
business scream for some reason

435
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:40,259
give us one moment here problem I guess

436
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:42,899
while we're here uh so your weighted

437
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:44,459
example like how are you so is it like

438
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:48,059
Bob does most of the work in the

439
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:51,200
situation so he gets most of the like

440
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:54,599
earnings yeah I've actually and I've

441
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,279
we've come I've come across this in

442
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:02,249
various groups and so with the weighted

443
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:04,709
examples so Bob like so use a really

444
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:06,839
example with some of the people that

445
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:10,799
I've worked with before so we had to do

446
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:13,489
a external pin test and simulated attack

447
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:17,729
and at the same time they wanted us to

448
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:20,190
test their mobile app when we first

449
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:24,259
started we figured the network attack

450
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,820
and the test would be the most work but

451
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:30,200
that actually went very fast and very

452
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:33,619
easy we found that the mobile app just

453
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:37,109
the way that they had written it and

454
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:38,908
obfuscated it it was a mess to work with

455
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:41,458
and so we went and from a weighted

456
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:44,519
example the guy who did the mobile app

457
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:47,009
test because it was so much more work we

458
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,309
put him at like the 2x where everybody

459
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:53,909
else got the 1x just based on the amount

460
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:56,489
of work that was done yeah I've always

461
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:58,799
found that like sometimes I feel kind of

462
00:22:56,489 --> 00:23:00,599
bad because like B and a couple of my

463
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,179
friends always join a team we always

464
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:05,099
split everything 50/50 and you know

465
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:07,440
sometimes it's like one of my friends

466
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:10,109
does a really great amount of work and

467
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,639
I'm always like ah I know we agreed to

468
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:13,228
5050 but if you want to take the whole

469
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:15,208
learning like you might as well like you

470
00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:17,039
pretty much found this on your own yeah

471
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:18,509
and there's you know like that's just

472
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:23,309
how it is it just comes and goes a buck

473
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:25,919
Bonnie isn't like yeah I mean yeah yeah

474
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:30,209
so in a lot of cases like when I'm

475
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,249
scoping it I we can already kind of tell

476
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:34,979
who out of the team is probably gonna do

477
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:37,109
more than another yeah because that's a

478
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:39,029
team like are we all gonna evenly split

479
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:43,280
it or are we gonna do more of a weighted

480
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:47,960
yeah yeah so what I run into is uh

481
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:50,930
I like the skillset like involved in

482
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,970
each phone right so like I always have a

483
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,130
hard time thinking like okay so I use my

484
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,380
really good recent recalls to find a

485
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,940
host that that person wouldn't normally

486
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,340
my partner would have not would have

487
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,140
normally not found right yes and then he

488
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,629
finds a vulnerability which isn't like

489
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,950
technically like hard to do for like

490
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,810
something like exercice or something

491
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,370
like that but he actually found the

492
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,230
vulnerability on that house and I didn't

493
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,689
so like I always have a trouble like

494
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,520
figuring out like like who gets what is

495
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,110
that 50/50 or is like finding the host

496
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,910
easier was exploiting the cross-site

497
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,800
scripting easier so like I always have

498
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,720
trouble with that yeah and this is this

499
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,580
is something I've like also ran into in

500
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,350
like the last private Bugs Bunny we went

501
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,510
to you like we're all just working in a

502
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,010
big group and then we were like oh we

503
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,720
can drop you our shells onto this and

504
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:35,450
like you know control-c drops you in a

505
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,740
shell and then somebody like in another

506
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,900
part of the room was like oh you know

507
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,020
somebody doesn't bond oh got it bounty

508
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,400
and then it was like okay like you just

509
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,590
got the whole bounty nobody argued but

510
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,300
it was like well you know like this

511
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,639
other person is the one that pointed it

512
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,950
all out right the one that kind of did

513
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:56,930
all of it I mean this could be an

514
00:24:51,950 --> 00:25:00,650
hour-long talk itself so we are live by

515
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:02,600
the way but we got back so yeah this

516
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:06,380
we've caught these last couple minutes

517
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,740
actually we can go through the final

518
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:13,130
couple slides and but yeah thank you for

519
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:16,060
for your guy's patience for both you

520
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,710
specters and and Jeff but uh but also

521
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,929
everyone else who's who's watching thank

522
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,540
you for your patience and yeah yeah

523
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:25,430
that's let's get back into it

524
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:29,510
perfect timing we broke it at the great

525
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:31,700
point the how to kind of really decide

526
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,650
who gets paid what when you're working

527
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,170
as a team as somebody who all might have

528
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:39,980
heard we were going through various

529
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:42,500
cases that did happen do you you really

530
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:47,480
need to decide this at the beginning it

531
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:50,090
it's not good to try to go okay we're

532
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,510
midway through we found these things now

533
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,918
how do we decide to break the money up

534
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:57,609
you want to decide at the beginning

535
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,590
is the guy who did a little bit more

536
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:02,359
going to get paid more because he worked

537
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:06,559
harder or are we gonna split it all

538
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:09,499
evenly as I was saying I don't know if

539
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,779
the viewers heard earlier sometimes when

540
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:14,239
scoping out what you need to do as a

541
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:17,659
team you can decide at that point well

542
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:20,720
it might be more work for Bob but not so

543
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:23,619
much for Joe so let's go and give Bob 2x

544
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,869
of what we receive and Joe gets one

545
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:29,629
where if it really scoped out everybody

546
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:31,459
is contributing equally then maybe it

547
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:33,559
does work better to kind of make that

548
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,759
even split where everybody gets the same

549
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:41,690
amount there is no one rule to solve

550
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:43,549
this problem you just have to really

551
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,739
attack it on a case-by-case basis and

552
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:47,989
sometimes yeah you might feel you didn't

553
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:50,869
make enough for what you did other times

554
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:52,519
you might feel oh well I made too much I

555
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:54,080
really didn't contribute so much so

556
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,989
maybe next time with the group we'll

557
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,908
will kind of spread that out a little

558
00:26:56,989 --> 00:27:04,940
bit better usually when you are working

559
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:09,440
as a team you will have out sometimes

560
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,090
that one non team player with that non

561
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,320
team player you really want to try to

562
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:16,668
explore more of why they're not working

563
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,850
well with the team could it be something

564
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:22,549
happening at home are at work that's

565
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,859
affecting them you do want to name what

566
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:27,799
you notice but don't blame or shame

567
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:29,658
anybody so you if you notice somebody's

568
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,940
not doing something properly you just

569
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:34,519
say hey maybe this is a better way to do

570
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:39,289
it and not hey Bob you didn't do that

571
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:41,389
right you also make a specific request

572
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:43,100
or a task for that person and see if

573
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:46,820
they can do it if it's very specific

574
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:49,609
sometimes people just they don't operate

575
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,529
really well on abstract so if you say go

576
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:54,619
attack the server they might not know

577
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:57,559
exactly what to do but if you say hey go

578
00:27:54,619 --> 00:28:00,769
run a a port scan on the server and then

579
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:03,080
any port open try to brute-force it then

580
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:05,119
though they'll be able to to be that

581
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,710
team player better and then always

582
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,709
invite feedback in comments from

583
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:12,290
everybody on the team

584
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:15,890
that way you grow as a team and you

585
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:18,889
learn how people felt or what didn't

586
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:21,740
work what did work and unfortunately if

587
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,810
all else fails and it's not working well

588
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:29,890
sometimes you do have to remove that

589
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:32,419
person it happens I've removed best

590
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,730
friends of routines that I was working

591
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:38,210
on just because they didn't gel with the

592
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:41,990
whole team and when working together

593
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:45,680
there are various tools that do help I'm

594
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:48,260
a huge fan of Faraday Faraday lets you

595
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,320
collaborate and see what everybody's

596
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,690
doing in almost real-time the same with

597
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,780
dradis and attack forge attack forge is

598
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:59,030
one of the newer ones starting to like

599
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:02,139
it a tad bit more than Faraday but they

600
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:07,040
all have their own unique ability or

601
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:09,410
unique position in what you can do when

602
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,960
working in a large team or even a small

603
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,580
team that communication is the key

604
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,560
because you need to see what others are

605
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,800
doing so you don't overlap what they're

606
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:22,250
doing and these tools actually help that

607
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:25,070
you can go and see did somebody do a

608
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:29,600
certain test are they in the attack

609
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:31,460
chain that you decided so look out you

610
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,610
can do this over Skype you can use

611
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,530
Google Docs you can do however you want

612
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,209
but these are three of the more popular

613
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:41,450
tools that people are using to

614
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:51,320
collaborate these days and does anybody

615
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:53,480
have any questions well we are kind of

616
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,120
in this weird state where the stream is

617
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,580
going like in and out on the YouTube

618
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,489
live stream right now i am recording all

619
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:07,100
this stuff locally as well so we will

620
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:09,260
have recorded versions yeah drop and let

621
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,330
everybody know that I am in the discord

622
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:16,540
so if anybody does have any questions

623
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:16,540
just tip me up and I'll answer
