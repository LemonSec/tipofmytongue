1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:13,889
all right so hello everyone as Sam

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,230
introduced me my name is Rohan and for

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,590
this talk I just wanted to kind of go

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,500
over how I approach like group hacking

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,620
concepts because for me personally as a

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,630
hacker I never did group hacking a lot I

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,580
was more of a solo hacker where I you

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,219
know just go to my room and then hack

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,879
every day or something like that or on

10
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,430
the way but this year being in a college

11
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,230
and having a group of friends who are

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,420
interested on the same thing as me kind

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,428
of give me an idea to move more into

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,729
group hacking and the concepts of that

15
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:50,069
so I wanted to go over the whole idea of

16
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:53,760
how you can approach group hacking I

17
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:55,379
have been monitoring the chat on YouTube

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,030
for a while mom and I already know some

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,099
of the hackers there that do really good

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,659
group hacking as well and I'll kind of

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,609
be giving them a shout out as well

22
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:06,780
because those are the people that kind

23
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,490
of impressed me or influenced me to get

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,280
into group hacking so I'll discuss more

25
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,619
of that as we go but before we jump into

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,219
that just a quick introduction of who I

27
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,770
am as our say my name is Ron rehaul I'm

28
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,600
currently a student at Cal State for

29
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,140
turn California State University and

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,329
then I'm jr. doing a computer science

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,359
bachelor's right now so that's what my

32
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,820
primary focus is I do security related

33
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,640
stuff at my school so we have a club

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,279
here known as offensive security Society

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,250
I'm an active member of that and then

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,439
that's what I kind of dude that's where

37
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,049
I met people that are interested on the

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,809
same things as me I'll be mentioning

39
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,369
them as we go to the presentation

40
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,829
because those are the people that I have

41
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,409
to it with this verne ability that I'll

42
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,240
discuss today and also if you want to

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,920
follow me on my blog learning profiles I

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,809
have both my buck road and hacker one

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,359

50
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,540
me I basically share like all my blocks

51
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,340
through that Twitter account and then

52
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,250
sometimes are there like random stuff

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,240
that if you're interested in too

54
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,670
kind of stuff thank you spectres for

55
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,890
that non name is dope comment I like

56
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,230
that I came up with that when I was in

57
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,540
high school I was really into science

58
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,220
and other stuff and Sam would often to

59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,359
secure society I really like that name

60
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,440
so thank you very much for liking those

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,550
that said let's jump into the slides so

62
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,130
just a background on what the research

63
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,480
is because just telling you guys you

64
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,970
know we're going to discuss over the

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,239
research won't give you any idea of what

66
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,609
I wanted to focus on or what this whole

67
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:00,270
topic or this whole research was so a

68
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,760
quick introduction to it is about a year

69
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,360
ago or two years ago when I was freshman

70
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,570
in college

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,540
sauron 2017-18 NTE

72
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,910
released a blog post on medium that was

73
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,769
super viral a lot of hackers looked into

74
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,990
it and it was called how I hacked

75
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,170
hundreds of companies through their help

76
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:21,120
desk and it was really interesting to me

77
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,059
when I read it because I really like

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,620
looking into corporate systems even

79
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,750
though I'm more of a web app hacker I

80
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,400
like to look into how I can get inside a

81
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,980
company whether it's through their

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:37,410
Google Sites their internal management

83
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:39,209
and other instances so seeing that blog

84
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,859
from him really got me excited because

85
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,860
he hadn't managed to get access into

86
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,230
slack instances internal jeering since

87
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,810
and many others of companies so I try

88
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,579
reproducing it but as we all know when

89
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,489
that blood came out slack had already

90
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,799
managed to push out of fix with updating

91
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,170
emails so the email was no longer like

92
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,010
no reply at slack calm but it was more

93
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:05,880
of no reply - like random alphanumeric

94
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:08,280
instance at slack calm and then it was

95
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,980
fixed a lot of hackers tried to still

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,870
attack it the Zendesk of course is some

97
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,780
part still worked but then Sendas was

98
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,390
actively monitoring and adding spam

99
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,089
filters fixing like different ways to

100
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,039
send emails and all that so I was really

101
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,890
into that started researching more on it

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,320
and then I met two really good friends

103
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,570
of mine Brendan and super Raul

104
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,419
they both are part of offensive security

105
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,469
society at my school so when I met them

106
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,169
they were getting too

107
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,760
Bounty's and I started talking to them

108
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,380
about different things I've found and

109
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,650
different things I was looking into and

110
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,140
one of them was this instance so I'll

111
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,049
dive more into the timeline of how this

112
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,710
Albarn ability went but basically we

113
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,050
started by exploiting Google emails so

114
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,330
what we decided was everyone is trying

115
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,910
to do support attack but why not I'll

116
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,070
just get the company's email verified on

117
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,500
Google through Zendesk and then log into

118
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,280
a place we can with that email and see

119
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,190
what we get

120
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,520
so at the end we had exploited about 25

121
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,020
companies I managed to find a lot of

122
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,270
critical vulnerabilities through a lot

123
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,280
of companies with that and one of the

124
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,289
example report I think a lot of people

125
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,349
have seen this is the gift lab report

126
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:25,230
that was sent we're at I think it was

127
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,510
around 7 p.m. or something I we got

128
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:31,169
access to internal instances of gitlab

129
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:33,030
and it was super bad like we're kind of

130
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,950
surprised that we got access and we're

131
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,320
freaking out so that's why I wanted to

132
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:40,800
share about this specific report because

133
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,750
it was something truly a laptop closing

134
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,490
and then walking around the room kind of

135
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,980
situation I literally closed my laptop

136
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,200
to walk around the whole building for a

137
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,600
while to relax my energy and then got

138
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,969
back into hacking again so that's what

139
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,979
we'll be discussing on this as we move

140
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,630
so let's go to the story timeline of how

141
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,010
we came up with this what happened

142
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,310
during the research and everything like

143
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,430
that

144
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,960
so the first part of this whole thing

145
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,570
was understanding how the situation

146
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,409
worked in exploiting the Zen dispersed

147
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,820
so I was testing a company I have not

148
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,729
been given the permission to name the

149
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,770
company so I'll just say company X and I

150
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:23,070
managed to get there

151
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,530
Zenda slit at work but when I reported

152
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,090
it the analyst from the company side

153
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,099
responded saying it was a duplicate

154
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,729
because another hacker had managed to

155
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,169
get it beforehand which was because it

156
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,700
was I knew it was going to happen I'd

157
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,880
talk with the hacker in the past and

158
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,710
when talking with them he mentioned that

159
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,050
yeah I had reported it but he hadn't

160
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,989
like exported it to the basic instance

161
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,010
of getting into Yammer at the company we

162
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,400
still have much

163
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,680
information on it so I started looking

164
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,539
into more of it and and company

165
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,310
personally himself said if you manifest

166
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,920
skillet this is something we might

167
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,050
consider this as a valid book so while I

168
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,180
was at school I had a class at 5:00 p.m.

169
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,060
I was like alright I need to get this to

170
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:10,440
work I need to attack this I want that

171
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,090
bounty and 4:00 p.m. around uh I was

172
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,060
testing the class Ian instance of

173
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,979
signing up on a class Ian and it send me

174
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,860
a verification email saying you know

175
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,860
verify so for that company a comm on a

176
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,260
class Ian and you will get access to

177
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,910
huron a class Ian's system that was

178
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,780
because I had signed up my own a class

179
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:33,300
Ian instance but when I click verify and

180
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,919
I went to Derrick Aston instance because

181
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,190
it was like company a dot a classy

182
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,870
Annette I managed to get into it and

183
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,180
then I had access to all the security of

184
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,400
course that was coming in it had all the

185
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,560
serious like thinks that he will find

186
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,539
all zeros he wants everything being

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,120
realized all of that information was

188
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,490
there and that's for I understood like

189
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,140
this could be exploited to a massive

190
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,850
level where you could get access to a

191
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:01,950
lot of companies of passing an instance

192
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:04,410
and all of that critical things as soon

193
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:07,200
as I found that I decided well this is

194
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,150
the time where I like report it and you

195
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,860
know let the company know I discussed

196
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,979
with the company and they started

197
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,390
working on a fix right away but

198
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,820
something that like right then I was

199
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,740
working with those friends so we decided

200
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,990
this is super cool let's kind of

201
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,930
understand this further so what I did

202
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,720
was we decided to focus more on how like

203
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,370
life hacking events went work so if you

204
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,990
haven't been to a live hacking event or

205
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,929
like a buck bass that buck rogue does

206
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,299
there's usually expect call so and tell

207
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:38,189
where companies select one of the like

208
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,699
their best reports that they got for the

209
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,140
day or anything similar on that to kind

210
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,180
of you know discuss about the

211
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,290
vulnerability that the hacker found what

212
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:51,239
his approach was how to attack that and

213
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,920
right then at around 8:00 p.m. we

214
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,270
decided to meet up in our room so we

215
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,180
have like a small private room at our

216
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,280
school for our club you know we need a

217
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,839
quick presentation of how excluded it

218
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,880
one was like

219
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,710
acquirements from zen decide so

220
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,320
requiring support emails anything that

221
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:11,040
we needed and we started taking notes of

222
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,840
every attacks that we could do so once

223
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,520
we had done that the next day we came

224
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,010
back to our room and started planning

225
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,870
the whole research because at that point

226
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,090
we knew we could exploit this to more

227
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,580
companies but we just needed to manage

228
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,130
it well and not be super noisy about it

229
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,750
and we started attacking it from

230
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,990
February 20th

231
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:34,230
we went till I think Mart's around March

232
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:37,440
April and then we release our blog on 0

233
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:42,090
for 19 2019 and that's when we discussed

234
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,980
the whole exploit that said I kind of

235
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,840
want to go the strategies that we used

236
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,150
that I think is super important because

237
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,530
if you don't use the strategies you are

238
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,270
likely going to have some failure

239
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:54,780
throughout the way resilient group

240
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,699
hacking and for our research we needed

241
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,100
to have a proper strategy because it

242
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,560
could is super noisy you are emailing a

243
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,110
support company and you go have a lot of

244
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,579
you know support persons just focus on

245
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,740
your ticket if you're emailing them

246
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,530
multiple times which is wasting their

247
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,580
time and a prime example of that is once

248
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:16,140
I found this company person reached out

249
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,750
to me and then like I was discussing

250
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,600
with him and he said I challenge you to

251
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,730
find this on my company on the company

252
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,830
that I'm security engineer at and I said

253
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,200
alright I'll look into it I'll see what

254
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,450
I can do and I started emailing a

255
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,040
company like multiple times because one

256
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,910
time you to work the second time it

257
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,189
won't so I wanted to see how this whole

258
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,990
thing will work I wanted to see if the

259
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,970
company was teaming burnable because

260
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,790
there were instances where it will not

261
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,410
work and at the end of the day the

262
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,300
director of customer success just

263
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,310
emailed me and he was like hey I know

264
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,810
who you are I know you are from hacker 1

265
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,780
you're trying to hack into our system

266
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,880
for our bug bounty program which I'm

267
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,110
completely in support of but you know

268
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,880
I'm just going to close our reports

269
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,520
because it's taking the time away from

270
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,760
my team it's adding into our views so

271
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,350
please be mindful of that and once I saw

272
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,569
that I knew I had to like plan it out

273
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,550
better because I was wasting their time

274
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,040
and I was wasting my time when I'm

275
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,529
emailing them like 10 times or something

276
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,529
that's where the strategies person comes

277
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:22,649
out to get your targets to understand

278
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:25,259
them better and to exploit it and this

279
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,810
whole idea of rhe contest and exploit

280
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,940
works on any group hacking that you do

281
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:33,479
whether it's a lie packing event whether

282
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:36,360
it's the same research that I did right

283
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,339
so you could have you know read contest

284
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,899
and exploit on support systems you

285
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,940
understand their support and you attack

286
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,500
it and simply with live hacking events

287
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,480
if you're doing a group hacking you

288
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,759
don't want to repeat the same thing that

289
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,709
another of your group how group made

290
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,319
already did you want to do something

291
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,680
that is unique and then attack it based

292
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:55,319
on that

293
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,209
so doing a recon and then understanding

294
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:59,459
and attacking is perfect so for our case

295
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,560
we need a recon off finding all the

296
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:04,170
companies that use Zendesk and to have a

297
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,540
bug bounty program we obviously did not

298
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,339
want to go and attack you know any

299
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,569
companies that did not have a buck 90

300
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:11,339
program because and then then we're

301
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:15,089
doing being malicious and hacking them

302
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:17,310
for no reason right and for tests we

303
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,889
started splitting up our targets to

304
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,810
understand how they worked so because it

305
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:23,730
was between us three we decided suits

306
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,638
like targets based on what we have

307
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,230
hacked before so for example gitlab was

308
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,389
something we all looked into so we

309
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,970
decided let's hack on it together we

310
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:36,089
reported it together there were other

311
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,010
companies that we reported to that like

312
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,839
I personally hack a lot into so I

313
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,180
decided to like look into them more and

314
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,220
then someone else started looking into

315
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,680
like the programs that they were

316
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,930
interested in so for example sorry Paul

317
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,060
had some private invites that he had

318
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,859
previously reported bugs to so he really

319
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,910
wanted to look into those because he

320
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,670
wanted to see if he had something

321
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,680
critical on them so as we did that it

322
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,829
was started taking notes splitting it

323
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,349
apart looking into it more and we went

324
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:06,000
to the exploit face so the exploit is

325
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,939
was more of understanding like how the

326
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,639
emails are used you know once we have

327
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:14,519
that Google email what can we do because

328
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,949
sometimes there's nothing well there was

329
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,139
there's still one company where I have

330
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:20,910
the Google Google email but there's

331
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,329
nothing I can do because everything is

332
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,189
behind one log so even like any public

333
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:28,020
interface will force me to go to one

334
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:29,790
organ and we wanted to know

335
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,370
which companies did then and which did

336
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,140
not so another phase of our attack was

337
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:38,190
understanding subdue means that the

338
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:40,319
company has so like tools like a mass

339
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,020
becomes super useful for that we used

340
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,670
another really useful tool called syrtis

341
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,680
h which basically it's aster

342
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,870
certificates and transparency logs

343
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,989
website where it locks all the HTTP

344
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,820
search for a specific domain and we

345
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,130
started finding internal subdomains of

346
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,050
that if you check our kids lab report

347
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,730
that's what we exactly did with get lab

348
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,459
because we cannot find any external

349
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,990
domains so when we got that email we're

350
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:06,209
just there like we don't know what the

351
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,339
heck to do we're just there sitting down

352
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:10,229
you know no nothing to exploit and get

353
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,410
loud but then once we started going

354
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:16,260
through the cert attacks or cert

355
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:19,620
transfers we started finding some

356
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:22,230
internal subdomains and one like one

357
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,640
login one hit on their work perfectly

358
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,100
and we had access to their internal

359
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,740
system so that's where the exploit phase

360
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,630
comes to work I recommend everyone doing

361
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,700
group hacking to follow kind of the same

362
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,890
process of doing a recon identifying

363
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,470
your targets splitting it up based on

364
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,240
what your most experienced and so let's

365
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,950
say you find a graph QL and you have

366
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,140
someone in your group that's perfect at

367
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,940
that that is done graphically oh and for

368
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,100
the past years you know that the full

369
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,110
experience on that let them handle the

370
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,000
exploit on that if there's someone who

371
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,040
is focused more into you know github

372
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,450
open source recon like they know

373
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,880
everything about github they're know

374
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,339
exactly instances of where companies

375
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,439
leak secrets and all that let them focus

376
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,779
on that and then focus on the exploit

377
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,579
once you have something so that's a I

378
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:09,120
think a really good strategy to a

379
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:10,979
project group hacking um but I want to

380
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,190
jump more into the test and exploit

381
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,660
phase so what we did like once we had

382
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,700
the Google email because there's a lot

383
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,160
of things that it will do and I kind of

384
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,430
wanted to highlight all these companies

385
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,100
that we found all these services that we

386
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:30,089
attacked so one of them was the class

387
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,720
Ian I kind of mentioned a class Ian

388
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:35,220
before so what a fashion is is it has

389
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,440
JIRA and confluence that you can

390
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,240
download and run on your own server but

391
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,350
then at the same time you can also have

392
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,760
it installed or you know

393
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,250
in the cloud environment in a classy

394
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,470
Annette and it has a cool feature of

395
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,300
Allah on Google logins so that's the

396
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,180
first system that we attack you know

397
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,229
that was our like first process

398
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,300
unfortunately I do not have the picture

399
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,980
of the whiteboard we have but literally

400
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,839
a passing was our first attack once we

401
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,000
have the Google login where we'll just

402
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,940
type the company that'll calcium net and

403
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,530
see if it existed if it did will log in

404
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,960
with Google and then see if we had

405
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:11,350
access to it because in some cases what

406
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,510
what companies did were if the user

407
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,460
account did not exist it will provision

408
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,740
that and give us access to the classroom

409
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,450
system in other cases it will say your

410
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,520
access Testament denied you are not

411
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,840
allowed to look into the system and then

412
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,900
we're going to do much test at that

413
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:28,270
point but that's something um that I

414
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,770
also wrote on our blog post so if you

415
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,800
read the blog post you'll know we

416
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:37,270
mention a class in before that next

417
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,599
thing was a sauna this is a kind of like

418
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,220
a project management tool kind of things

419
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,900
where you can message someone you can

420
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,210
there's like Google calendars and all

421
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,800
the features that it has and I haven't

422
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:51,130
really good a story about this that I

423
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,959
wanted to tell so what happened was we

424
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,300
had a Google email for a company and

425
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,410
then we were trying to exploit we had

426
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,209
nothing on it

427
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,670
you know Brendan look into all other

428
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,350
instances like fashion will cannot get

429
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,079
anything I started looking into internal

430
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,520
subdomains and then we also and the

431
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,109
street came up with the idea like hey

432
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,810
let's start signing up on the company's

433
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:13,569
own instance right like the Cisco two

434
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,399
company a calm and then use their email

435
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,490
to sign up as a user and see if we had

436
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,080
some exploit from that so he was looking

437
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,240
into that part it worked for other

438
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,000
companies but not for this particular

439
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,829
one so as we looked into that we're kind

440
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,020
of stuck we had no idea what to do and

441
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,460
we're just like spitballing ideas of you

442
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,129
know we have seen this instance like

443
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,050
based on my work at when I entered that

444
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,150
tinder or when I internet hack or when I

445
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,250
work at hacker one and all the instances

446
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,050
I could see like hey we could be using a

447
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,450
class II and we could be using zoom or

448
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:46,720
anything other than like other features

449
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,940
and as we did that of there was another

450
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,980
research team in the room and that was

451
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,120
like they did not know the full exploit

452
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,950
we were doing what they were hearing all

453
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,459
these tools we're men sending all these

454
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,710
online

455
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,470
and one of the person from that research

456
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:02,500
this it was like one of you guys you use

457
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,000
sauna and none of us had any idea what

458
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,890
it was so he was like yeah this is what

459
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,600
this tool does you know a super Cooper

460
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:11,650
project management a lot of companies

461
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,899
use it we went to a song com signed in

462
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,220
as the Google email that we had and we

463
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,080
had access to the project management

464
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,030
right away so we go see all their

465
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,210
upcoming projects all access to internal

466
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:24,370
documents and that's something that I'll

467
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,440
probably mention at the end of like how

468
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,419
internal documents can be sensitive and

469
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,770
how I recommend everyone to look into

470
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,230
those when you get access to these

471
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:35,560
instances to but basically they are a

472
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,990
bunch of Google Docs that were public

473
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,970
that I like you know they were not

474
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,130
designed to be public but when they

475
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,710
shared it with someone else they

476
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,180
basically made it public and then we had

477
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,160
access to it's all where to do is click

478
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,140
and then open and we had all these

479
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,200
internal documents that have internal

480
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,180
management ideas we have project meeting

481
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,310
and agendas so those were like some of

482
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,170
the critical aspect to it so that is

483
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,200
where asana became super useful to us

484
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:04,090
we're having no other system and just

485
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,880
want project management gave us access

486
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:09,820
to a lot of critical secrets of the

487
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,670
corporate system another was internal

488
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,980
task force a lot of people have seen

489
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,260
these - words when you usually do

490
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,150
subdomain analysis some companies

491
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,640
so you'll see systems where it says

492
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,770
please log in with at company comm in

493
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,700
google or something and that's what we

494
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,950
decided to target

495
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,690
that's where gitlab was mostly burnable

496
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,400
because we're gonna find there asana

497
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,020
their gift lab obviously didn't use a

498
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,770
class II and add their own instance on

499
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,910
github org so we're kind of in a

500
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,129
bombed-out like we couldn't find

501
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,620
anything on get lab so we decided to go

502
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,900
through certain at that stage and we

503
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,389
started looking at all their subdomains

504
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,550
so once we did that we kind of had a

505
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,410
couple of subdomains like I think one of

506
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:53,620
them was Prometheus or something I

507
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,720
forgot the name that had the instance on

508
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,909
and it said please login and we're like

509
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,670
alright we can give it a shot we logged

510
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:02,260
in and it gave us access and the reason

511
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,000
was because it was provisioning those

512
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,680
accounts so that's something like that

513
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,230
was real interesting on these companies

514
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,690
is it will

515
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,460
if you have the domain or if you have

516
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,410
the Google login and even if you did not

517
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,880
have an account it will create an

518
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:17,460
account for you and you'll get access to

519
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,410
it so that was really interesting for us

520
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,960
to see and we got access to a lot of

521
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:29,220
internal desk works with that I'll give

522
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:31,380
me a second but like once we had these

523
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,210
internal desk words who had a lot of

524
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,250
other systems we go test because then we

525
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,100
got access to other instances we go see

526
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,860
their other internal subdomains and

527
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,929
another was slack instance so previously

528
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,209
I mentioned that slack instances did not

529
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:49,590
work for companies because it required

530
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,540
you to have some kind of like login or

531
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,419
you know slack instances we're using the

532
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:57,420
no reply with alphanumeric on creating

533
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:59,340
accounts but we used other support

534
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,820
systems to exploiting the slack instance

535
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,949
and kind of log in to multiple companies

536
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:08,060
slack instance so I'll go over that real

537
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:11,970
quick of the biggest story line on this

538
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:13,710
right here so the senders who was not

539
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,990
the one this system that we attacked

540
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,420
even though that was our original point

541
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,970
of view once we knew how zen de swert

542
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,280
and it was because it was using a unique

543
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,040
hash which we mentioned our block report

544
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,450
once we knew how that worked we started

545
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,480
looking into or we came up with an idea

546
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,670
like what if other super systems are

547
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,490
using the same exact thing what if there

548
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:37,860
are kind of referencing Zendesk on their

549
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,530
platform and are using the same idea

550
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,570
do you know thread emails or reply

551
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,639
whenever a user applies to those emails

552
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,460
like how do they thread those tickets

553
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,100
into one single ticket and during that

554
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,530
instance we started creating our own

555
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,899
software instances and it's to like try

556
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,940
to understand them because most of these

557
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,920
were unique instance like Zendesk we had

558
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,450
some experience in but then there was a

559
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,030
support system called

560
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,890
called help scout and we had no idea how

561
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:07,530
that work we had never used it so we

562
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:10,680
created a separate instance I spawned up

563
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,899
a email on my personal domain which

564
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,660
support had my personal domain calm to

565
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,120
retrieve all the tickets and it started

566
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,280
like kind of attacking slash analyzing

567
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,919
it at the same point and we ended up

568
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,230
finding

569
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,760
it did exactly the same thing ads and as

570
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:29,290
so equal to the whole ticket trick

571
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,540
attack on it but then one of the super

572
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,270
interesting thing on there was Sanders

573
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,220
had spam filters so that could prevent

574
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,040
most of our attack but this company did

575
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,440
not so what one of the person in the

576
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,570
team we were looking at do it and they

577
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,180
came up with like if we can embed

578
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,770
messages and that's how we're attacking

579
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,200
all this so we're cool like we'll put

580
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,730
our name as the hash and then that's how

581
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,620
we'll verify it because if the hats was

582
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,780
on the email it will embed it to our

583
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,270
ticket they can really like can't we

584
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,100
possibly do the same attack on slap so

585
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,379
we started looking into slack instance

586
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,919
and then slack had a super cool feature

587
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,130
called

588
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,260
find my slack instances what that does

589
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,180
is you give your email and then it will

590
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,910
send you a list of all stack and since

591
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,710
you are part of what that is super

592
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,500
interesting is that it will also give

593
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,390
you invitations or like it will give a

594
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,510
list of invitations that you haven't

595
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,860
slacked and for that specific person it

596
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,680
also gives the name of the slack

597
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,689
instance and the invitation link so what

598
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,850
we did was who is fund of our own slack

599
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:34,330
instances I think by the end we had like

600
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,709
50 slack instance we created for this we

601
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,189
are like the name set up to be that

602
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:41,770
house of the ticket and then once the

603
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,530
ticket passed we had it was on the slack

604
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:46,600
we invited the support email into that

605
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:50,020
slack so what that will do now is put

606
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,820
our slack instance inside that support

607
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,980
system or in for that email like it's

608
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,139
one of the invitation slack and once

609
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,570
that was done you know we'll go to the

610
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,760
find my slack instance and then put the

611
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,250
company's support at slack to our

612
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,780
support at domain.com into slack and

613
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,400
then slack will send it a list it will

614
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,100
say hey you can be part of this this and

615
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,530
this and because it had our invitation

616
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:14,050
on it all of that slack instances will

617
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,510
be listed on that ticket so then there

618
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,700
will be like a single launch link where

619
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,040
you basically click on the launch it had

620
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,500
a single sign-on or like one-time link

621
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,810
kind of idea where basically click on it

622
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,940
and it will log you in directly so we're

623
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,610
able to do that and log into multiple

624
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:33,520
companies slack instances and sometimes

625
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,000
even sign up so the unfortunate part of

626
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,740
that

627
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,440
we had to like wait for the agent to

628
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,320
reply to see all the slack instances so

629
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,820
what we did was the one time link they

630
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,730
don't work for a particular company

631
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,490
because the one time link expires in 24

632
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,410
hours so what we decided to do was hey

633
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:53,140
you know try to create an account

634
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:55,840
instead so we use a classic support plus

635
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,210
one trick where we basically signed up

636
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,280
or create invited that email with

637
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,830
software plus one at domain.com to our

638
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,139
slack and because that user account

639
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,480
didn't exist slack allows us to create

640
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,600
our own account into the supports pom

641
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:14,110
into those slack instances and once we

642
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:17,139
had those we're into like critical

643
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:20,320
things we had access to internal third

644
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,520
party conversations so for example I'm

645
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,620
not going to mention the company or

646
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,960
anything like that we found on there but

647
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,639
basically had a single channel feature

648
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,140
where they were inviting their clients

649
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,360
to discuss features with them or

650
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,920
whenever the clients had problems so we

651
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,899
could see all the messaging going on

652
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,700
between them API tokens were being

653
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,980
passed into those messages so you could

654
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,500
do a lot of attacks there and then we

655
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:44,470
also had access to other like one of the

656
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,570
slack instance had a channel that was

657
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,680
public that had all the passwords for

658
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,290
some of their products and environments

659
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,830
so those were like criticals to see once

660
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:55,450
we were hacking into those and so until

661
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,490
so that's something like that's the

662
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,650
primary focus of group hacking in my

663
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,300
opinion is sharing what you're finding

664
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:03,850
or anything that you see unique with

665
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,740
everyone in your group when we came up

666
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,929
with the slack idea I did a test run

667
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,760
with the company so I did a test run on

668
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,620
my own and it worked obviously on my

669
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,760
company because I had everything like I

670
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,409
knew exactly what to do

671
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,310
but I wanted to see if it'll work on a

672
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:19,990
real background target so again like we

673
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,149
already have we used to hack on the

674
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,910
evening time so it was around like 6 7

675
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,800
p.m. I send that test woke up next

676
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,330
morning I had constants in the evening

677
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,310
so I was just on my computer in the

678
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,199
morning and then I got a email reply

679
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,940
from one of the agents and it had all

680
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,410
the slack instance on it so I just took

681
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,580
a picture of that sent it to my friends

682
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,640
I was like it worked

683
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,649
let's discuss this now so we went when

684
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,840
we went to school and I did a whole demo

685
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,970
on them on my own company - so like how

686
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,949
this works we started taking notes of

687
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,809
all that

688
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,000
and then we started exploiting it right

689
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:53,970
away so that was something we decided to

690
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,309
do is do so until no matter how small it

691
00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:00,419
could be because then someone else has

692
00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:02,668
an idea of chaining it I think I don't

693
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,860
know if I know exactly what sir than it

694
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:08,490
was but in one of the life hacking

695
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:11,549
events Johnny Benson Johnny frog his

696
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,500
ghost with rather be online on Twitter

697
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,408
he works at tinder he mentioned that he

698
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,820
had came up with like he had a unique

699
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:19,350
situation where he had an environment

700
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,210
and then he couldn't do much with it

701
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,740
so he asked someone like he told someone

702
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,059
else on its group like hey I have this

703
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,919
environment I don't know what to do with

704
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,600
it and the other person said try this

705
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,450
and it worked and they had a critical

706
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,039
bug right away so always sharing like

707
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,230
what you're finding even a smallest

708
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:36,450
sakuga subhuman or it could be like a

709
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,090
crafty old environment right and then

710
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,679
sharing it with someone else will the

711
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,779
super useful because then you get access

712
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,840
to a lot of critical aspects to it

713
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:48,330
ah classic shout out I'll give on this

714
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,580
one is to Edie and Karim who did the

715
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,860
research on Travis CI recently and they

716
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,389
published it because for them it was

717
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,250
really nice to see like how they

718
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:58,590
approached the whole idea of group

719
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,870
hacking tube where they hacked on groups

720
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,610
where someone found that something will

721
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,799
happen with Travis CI worse leaking

722
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:08,039
credentials the whole team worked on

723
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,480
creating a script to analyze it as they

724
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:12,179
found the burn ability like Kareem

725
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,159
started reporting it looked into it more

726
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:16,320
and it was really nice to see the same

727
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,809
idea where this shared what they have

728
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,610
found among each other and then started

729
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:22,678
it's making it a bigger bug than it

730
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:25,918
could be right so taking a low-hanging

731
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,260
but potentially or hard to exploit at

732
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,000
first to a super critical and super easy

733
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,010
to exploit because now once you have the

734
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,289
script you just want it on a company's

735
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:36,510
domain on Travis CI and you see all the

736
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:37,860
secrets popping up if they have one so

737
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,179
that was really nice to see I just

738
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,809
wanted to give them a shout out where

739
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:44,789
they did that excellently so let's move

740
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:46,408
on to the key takeaways like what I got

741
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,600
out from group hacking were specially

742
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:50,460
for me as I mentioned before I don't do

743
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,049
a lot of group packings I don't like

744
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,700
high parts that in lie back and then

745
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:56,250
sometimes but most of the time it's

746
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,260
remote you to school and then because of

747
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,580
school - I just like come home hack for

748
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,539
an hour or something and then start

749
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,218
studying again

750
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:04,709
so group hacking was really not an

751
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:06,570
option for me before but being in

752
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:08,999
college like being in this group has

753
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,499
helped me to evolve on that part so I

754
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:13,679
kind of wanted to write the takeaways of

755
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:16,919
that how to use it like how you can

756
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,449
understand key takeaways how to how what

757
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,649
you can get out of like what I've done

758
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:25,289
in group hacking so burnout I think this

759
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:28,408
is something that every hacker has gone

760
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:29,789
through if anyone says they haven't gone

761
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:31,169
through a burnin I'll promise it they're

762
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:33,779
lying because that's like pretty much

763
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:35,459
something you'll go to and that's what

764
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,869
has happened to him in the password you

765
00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:39,029
know I have been hacking for a long time

766
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:40,619
and then when you're doing find a bug

767
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:43,199
you're just they're like well I cannot

768
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:45,389
find things I need to take a break and

769
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:46,799
once you start taking a break some of

770
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:48,839
the hackers have said it's really hard

771
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,519
to get back and that's where like group

772
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,139
hacking in comes to work I recommend

773
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,849
that if you're doing a break or

774
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:56,069
something and if you want to get back

775
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:57,869
into hacking work with a couple of

776
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:59,699
friends you know talk with them start

777
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:01,559
hacking with them because then you kind

778
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:03,419
of get excited to see how they are

779
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:05,339
hacking and that's literally what it was

780
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:07,649
for me when I was in the break time is

781
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:09,269
because Brennan and three will be

782
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:10,829
hacking on different targets and I could

783
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:13,349
hear them like talk about different burn

784
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:15,359
abilities they're looking into or a you

785
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:17,158
know a specific end point that they were

786
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,439
trying to attack and that was something

787
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,289
that was interesting to them so whenever

788
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,089
I listen to that I'll pretty much say

789
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:26,369
like hey you know I can help with it

790
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,928
like send me the target if we were in

791
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:30,418
the same program let's act together and

792
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:31,949
that's how I got into it you basically

793
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,359
are surrounded by friends you're

794
00:30:31,949 --> 00:30:35,039
surrounded by people who are super

795
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,629
excited on same thing as you are and

796
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,219
that kind of gives a really good

797
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:40,439
environment especially if you're hacking

798
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:42,029
like face-to-face so because they are

799
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,009
called as friends we're in the same room

800
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:45,629
we know each other very well and we're

801
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:50,369
hacking together and that was really

802
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:52,109
nice to see and I had to add this gift

803
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:54,779
it's because that's literally what like

804
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:56,579
group hacking will be when I said you

805
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:58,859
know literally you can with group hack

806
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:00,448
you can take a low-hanging fruit to a

807
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:02,968
critical bug that could literally be

808
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:05,039
laptop closing and walking out and I

809
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:06,749
mentioned that on gitlab if people were

810
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,700
if you guys were paying attention on

811
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:11,609
that when I said we didn't have anything

812
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,079
to you do give live attacks we didn't

813
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:14,399
have any supplements or like we didn't

814
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,100
have any public domain so

815
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,250
there's so we didn't know what to do but

816
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,139
then we're like well let's see if we can

817
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,670
find something and then three and I

818
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,350
started looking into it

819
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,730
Brendon was in class so soon and I

820
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,490
started looking into subdomains

821
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,620
and we started finding all this internal

822
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,790
supplements that I could log into and I

823
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,070
was just sitting there on my computer I

824
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,930
was like this is not possible I thought

825
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,970
I was like this must be a public

826
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:42,930
instance so what I did was I logged out

827
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:44,460
went to my personal personal email and

828
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,830
they started signing in and I was

829
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,600
getting on at the rice condoms so I just

830
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,220
sat there in disability and I was just

831
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,290
there like seems like we've got

832
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,750
something super bad so I was freaking

833
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:57,149
out when we got access to that I closed

834
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,600
my laptop took a quick lap lap around

835
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,740
the room and then get back into my chair

836
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,419
reported the bug and then restocked a

837
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,250
couple of friends on buck 94 I'm saying

838
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,450
like you know if you know someone that

839
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,520
could live I need to talk right now

840
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,530
because I got access to something bad

841
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,570
and I don't want to I don't want them to

842
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:15,510
wait till tomorrow to see it in case it

843
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:17,220
will be worse so thankfully you're Burt

844
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:19,230
knew someone there he connected me at

845
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,620
good laugh and then they looked into it

846
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,780
right away

847
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,120
and it was pretty much result pretty

848
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,550
soon so that's where like hacking in

849
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,050
groups come to work where I was taking a

850
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,909
break for a month and then all of a

851
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,919
sudden once this worked once we started

852
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:34,110
attacking I was back into that hacking

853
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,030
mood where I was not burned out anymore

854
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:38,159
you know I could see them hacking and

855
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:41,370
that encouraged me to hack more so

856
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,290
that's where burnout is combated by goop

857
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,419
hacking so as I said if you're taking a

858
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,129
break and want to get back into it

859
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,200
they start working with friends that

860
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:50,970
will be your biggest success and you'll

861
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,450
get to learn so much more than you'll

862
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:57,210
probably learn in the past another thing

863
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:58,860
is you learn things new every day

864
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,500
this kind of goes with the Barnard idea

865
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,570
you as you're hacking in group someone

866
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,540
there in that group is more qualified

867
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:08,669
than you on a specific topic it could be

868
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,860
in mobile hacking it could be on web app

869
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:12,660
it could be specific things on web app

870
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,310
for example Groff qo which is something

871
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:16,590
new and a lot of people are looking into

872
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,240
it and if you have someone in your group

873
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:20,850
that's better than you you get to learn

874
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,650
from them there's a code that I really

875
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:24,209
like to follow and that's something I

876
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,750
see it in life hacking him and every day

877
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,490
every time when I purchased it is if you

878
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,260
the smartest person in the room you're

879
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,640
in the wrong room because then you're

880
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,590
not learning anything new you're

881
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,940
descending what you're learning which is

882
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,320
good but then you are not learning

883
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,420
anything new that it can share with

884
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,220
others in the future and life hacking

885
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,260
event has taught me the same exact

886
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:45,080
things I've been to remote events where

887
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:48,020
i hack remotely and and send the reports

888
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:50,300
but then when I see the so until that

889
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,920
companies do I get to learn something

890
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,290
new every day because this hackers have

891
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,390
like really unique idea I mean we can

892
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,550
just look into how into your purses his

893
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,500
fur nebulae recordings you find some

894
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:03,050
crazy things on this so on tell us where

895
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,610
you were just era like I could not never

896
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:07,070
thought this relax would work but you

897
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,719
managed to make it work and that's what

898
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,090
happens in group packing when you do so

899
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,790
and tells you know with the support

900
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,470
instance when help scout we started

901
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,899
attacking it we had no idea what we will

902
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:19,580
do and because we already knew like we

903
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:21,440
go get the googliness but we wanted to

904
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,690
get something worse and we came up with

905
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,020
the idea hey let's just try slack and

906
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,970
see how that works and then as the treat

907
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,219
shows like person once said I tried this

908
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:33,049
and it didn't work person - let's try

909
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:34,580
this and try and then person three is

910
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,200
like yeah it worked we got a critical

911
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,489
now and that's literally what happened

912
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,668
with us when we're doing the group

913
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:43,759
packing so that's another thing that was

914
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:46,009
a key takeaway from me for like when we

915
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,020
do group packing like how you soon what

916
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,879
do you get out of it it's not always you

917
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,460
know what you always get out of it what

918
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,290
you had to do so having been part of a

919
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:58,670
group acting there has been super

920
00:34:54,290 --> 00:35:00,110
interesting to me um I I added the slide

921
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,450
right before the presentation because I

922
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,920
forgot this one is the tools that helps

923
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,540
with group packing it's not always

924
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,820
communicating since there you also have

925
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,350
to have a proper management on it you

926
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,990
want to make sure like you're doing it

927
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,970
properly you have a well timed attack or

928
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:16,339
and like anything else or that it

929
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,750
doesn't create a lot of notes so for us

930
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,510
we wanted to make sure we're not

931
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:22,880
attacking the same thing especially for

932
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,710
our research support system it was not

933
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,300
like we were attacking one company we're

934
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:29,390
attacking a lot of different companies

935
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:32,090
at once with the same attack and we

936
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:34,220
wanted to make sure we're not stepping

937
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,840
into someone else's program right so

938
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,569
let's say Brandon was hacking into

939
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,160
bugcrowd and I didn't want to hack into

940
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,520
buck already few us because he had

941
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,950
already

942
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,080
and the idea how it works miss Fasulo

943
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:47,240
and Booker and he's already experienced

944
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,400
on that part and then that's where we

945
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,109
decided let's do some kind of cool

946
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,930
sharing you know let's era our passwords

947
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,340
on LastPass we created even when we had

948
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,830
the Google email we made sure that

949
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,380
companies were not compromised in any

950
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:02,900
way in the future so we created like 25

951
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,460
long character passwords for those who

952
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,110
kill accounts or any accounts we made

953
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,960
and then we shared amongst each other

954
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,370
whenever we had something so when we got

955
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,810
the Google email we'll share that with

956
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,549
someone else you know Sarah in the group

957
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,320
and be like hey I got this Google email

958
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,720
I cannot do much with it can someone

959
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,520
else look into it and then because they

960
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,750
had the password they go do the same and

961
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,640
they didn't have to do the same at that

962
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:26,150
again we prevent it all the noise that

963
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,430
was needed another thing was github we

964
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,230
had a whiteboard in our room which we

965
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,910
took notes on but we wanted to make sure

966
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,750
we had it one way out of our home

967
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:37,460
because having it in the room is useful

968
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,960
when we're hacking on site but let's say

969
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,240
if we're all you know in our homes

970
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,100
hacking together we still need to get up

971
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,319
to share our notes so we created a

972
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,660
private repo shared all our notes that

973
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,970
we had and then discussed that as we

974
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,850
went through another thing is Excel or

975
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:55,879
Google C so this is super you know old

976
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,380
old tools but it still works is do you

977
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,210
want to keep track of what you're doing

978
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,830
right you don't want as I say you don't

979
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:05,870
want to lose get into someone else's

980
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:07,520
step and that's literally what we did we

981
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:09,620
made sure we had a Google seat with all

982
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,970
the domains or all the companies listed

983
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,839
the status of testing so we had tested

984
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,370
exploited and we're done another thing

985
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,170
it was like literally we called it pond

986
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:20,990
one we had access to everything we

987
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:23,240
needed and the report status for like

988
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:25,729
bug fraud or hacker one it was like p 1

989
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,919
p 0 p to whatever the severity was and

990
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:30,350
that kind of helped us keep track of our

991
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,830
work and to see like where we were when

992
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:35,660
we're hacking so wide verse simple but

993
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,190
super effective i am white word at home

994
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,170
i were like we have white birds at

995
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:42,830
school and its really nice because you

996
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:44,330
get to so like what is going on you know

997
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,799
way of like you are describing at your

998
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,660
writing instead of just typing and

999
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,310
assigning someone that right so you're

1000
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,589
presenting while you're writing and i

1001
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,090
really like that idea i recommend people

1002
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,680
to try it

1003
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,390
I have a video right here or picture

1004
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,859
right here from Edie he already

1005
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:01,400
mentioned all the comment as well is

1006
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:03,380
this was from h-12 or - this is from the

1007
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,880
video that he took picture of in the

1008
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,220
background you can see like behind

1009
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,880
France and Mattias Matt I don't know how

1010
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,410
to pronounce his name we he has a white

1011
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,390
border and they were planning out like

1012
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,490
how to write - and that's something that

1013
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,560
has that have done frequently as I do

1014
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,359
more group packing is have something

1015
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,160
like where I can just write down on the

1016
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:26,510
whiteboard and then explain like as we

1017
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,549
go so it's doing kind of a hacking like

1018
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:31,250
an interviews less hacking together kind

1019
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:33,440
of things so I really like that idea and

1020
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,960
I wanted to kind of shout out to Ed for

1021
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,730
this too because he does a really cool

1022
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,200
like when he does group hacking just

1023
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:43,090
really cool stuff so I wanted to give

1024
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,830
him a major shout out on this that said

1025
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:50,390
I kind of went really quick with the

1026
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:51,980
presentation but I just wanted to say

1027
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:55,040
thank you for everyone for watching this

1028

about I think someone mentioned about

1037
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,880

1038
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,950
questions about those anything about

1039
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,370
group hacking or anything like that feel

1040
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,370
free to ask

1041
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:33,739

1043
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,480
him that surprise too because I know he

1044

does really good works on this things

1045
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,970
yeah that was um so his Franz was on the

1046
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,749
left in that picture and it was Matthias

1047
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:48,249
Carlson or Lydian Brune is his

1048
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:51,828
researcher name

1049
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:54,399
yeah I like I know his first time I just

1050
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:58,359
didn't know how to love the asset yeah

1051
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:01,670
Matthias is how I pronounce it but yeah

1052
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:05,630
he's a great great team great group out

1053
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:08,900
of Sweden and earlier hi miss remembered

1054
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:12,319
stock Stoke Friedrich he's also from

1055
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:31,160
Sweden as well yeah very good crew out

1056
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:35,058
there well I mean if unless we have

1057
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:38,029
anything come in through chat here over

1058
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:43,190
the next little bit I guess we can yeah

1059
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:45,200
can move on but guess we'll wait for a

1060
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:49,880
few more seconds see if anything comes

1061
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,970
in and asks oh that's interesting it's

1062
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:56,210
kind of an interesting question given so

1063
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:58,459
it asks how you guys just decide how to

1064
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:01,249
split out the bug bounties on a team

1065
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:03,049
which is kind of interesting because at

1066
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:04,609
bugcrowd we're working where you will

1067
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:07,400
have something that will help with that

1068
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:10,880
soon but I'm interested in how you would

1069
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,710
even how do you decide on what

1070
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,069
percentage like oh you know I'm gonna

1071
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:18,230
give you 20% or 30% or whatever how do

1072
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:19,640
you how do you guys discuss that amongst

1073
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:22,700
yourselves and how do you decide what's

1074
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,348
fair so for most of it are like there

1075
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,569
were some programs where we're just

1076
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:29,029
invited as like a person so let's just

1077
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:31,339
who you three was invited to a specific

1078
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:32,720
program and he was hacking on it we

1079
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:34,759
didn't know what to any split boundaries

1080
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,308
on that because that was his program he

1081
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:38,299
spent the effort on it even though like

1082
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:40,249
you know we're doing group

1083
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:42,079
works I said you take the bounty because

1084
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:43,788
you put the effort on it you chose the

1085
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,650
target you went on the fully exploit

1086
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:46,969
face and if you need help we can help

1087
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:51,829
but we are not going to take down this

1088
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:53,329
on that another thing we did was for

1089
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:56,119
some of the programs we did bounties

1090
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:58,249
based on effort so for example if one

1091
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:00,079
person does the full exploit so they did

1092
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:01,640
the hose-end s attack got the Google

1093
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,589
email and we help them with like

1094
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,288
exploiting it further we'll do like

1095
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:08,029
something like they take the 70% or 75%

1096
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:11,660
of the bounty and we take the last bits

1097
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:14,209
of it in I think in one particular

1098
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,949
program Brendan and I did a 50/50 on it

1099
00:42:14,209 --> 00:42:19,279
because we both were invited on it and

1100
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:21,829
we're hacking together and we like both

1101
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:23,779
escalated it in a different manner so he

1102
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:25,549
had the Zendesk but he was having

1103
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:28,130
problem with Google so like they were

1104
00:42:25,549 --> 00:42:29,569
gone different emails being used so he

1105
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,459
already knew it was being it was

1106
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:33,619
burnable but they're not using like

1107
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:35,419
support at you know so we had to go find

1108
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:36,890
different emails and that's where I

1109
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,869
helped him with you know we attack it

1110
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,759
further we came up on like we did a zoom

1111
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:42,619
meeting because he was a helm home and

1112
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:45,019
then we start attacking it so that's

1113
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:47,059
where like the 50-50 comes to work but

1114
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:50,089
in the end for me personal like bounties

1115
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:52,309
more of our benefits that our token from

1116
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:54,709
a company so our split more of us like

1117
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:57,170
effort best sometimes sometimes it was

1118
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:59,359
5050 and sometimes it was 100% on

1119
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,099
whoever did the whole attack if you are

1120
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,449
invited on that program like if you're

1121
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:04,699
the only person on it just do it

1122
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:06,439
yourself because you know the idea like

1123
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:09,049
you have done the research you have the

1124
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:11,118
experience do it get the bounty and then

1125
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:16,640
you know you enjoy that bounty right so

1126
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:18,679
that's what we focused on okay also had

1127
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,058
a question Casey asked a question in

1128
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:24,949
chat yeah he asked are there any reasons

1129
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:27,890
that you can think of that the program

1130
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:31,429
and program owners wouldn't want to

1131
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:34,150
allow this sort of collaboration on

1132
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:36,979
their particular program or engagement

1133
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:40,160
there were some programs where they're

1134
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:42,249
kind of like skeptical on having

1135
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,410
collaborators on or something like that

1136
00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:47,808
one of the reasoning was like that

1137
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:49,999
person is invited but we haven't seen

1138
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:52,250
the Mac a lot so like how do we

1139
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:54,680
guarantee that he's not exploiting it

1140
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,600
but other than that like I honestly

1141
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:00,379
think a lot of programs are getting into

1142
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:02,060
more of collaborators idea and one thing

1143
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,010
I'll highly recommend is if you are

1144
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,930
doing a group aking it's something like

1145
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,510
unique for example like Travis CI that

1146
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:10,669
ended support system or anything like

1147
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:12,860
you do on group hacking talk about it on

1148
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,650
public because then the companies can

1149
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:17,900
see the result of it and they will see

1150
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:20,060
the benefits of it right right now like

1151
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,440
group hacking is not knowing a lot exit

1152
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,660
through like life hacking events bug

1153
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,970
passes or some of these like lots that

1154
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,830
come out and that's what's making the

1155
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,959
companies understand like instead of

1156
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,430
having one hacker just report the bug

1157
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,070
and then they send it to other hackers

1158
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:36,680
you know we can increase it by having a

1159
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:38,480
feature and buck herd is doing it now

1160
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,040
hacker one has done it is the

1161
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,750
collaborators feature and that has

1162
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,600
encouraged a lot of group hacking in the

1163
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:47,270
past and it still does and companies are

1164
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,580
realizing having these groups hack

1165
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:51,320
together will give them more verne

1166
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,850
abilities that are severe and just like

1167
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,640
getting low-hanging fruits or like low

1168
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:57,589
security bugs every day so no I think

1169
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,370
more like the more we talk about it the

1170
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:02,900
more publicity it gets if it will be

1171
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:05,359
something that a lot of companies will

1172
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,250
run towards because everyone and the end

1173
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,320
like everyone wants success in their

1174
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,700
program no one wants to have a case

1175
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,560
where they're not paying any bounties

1176
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,240
and then one day they find out like a

1177
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,910
hacker has been on your system for nine

1178
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,040
months right so having this kind of

1179
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,390
group hacking or about kind of investing

1180
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,640
on that is something I think every

1181
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,770
program will want to do such that they

1182
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,690
want to see and evidence of it being

1183
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:29,180
successful before they even type into it

1184
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,400
because one thing a lot of hackers I

1185
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,169
think don't realize is and I didn't

1186
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,090
realize this until I was interning at

1187
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:36,770
tinder is when you run a program it's

1188
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:39,230
not just a security team involved on

1189
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,390
there's other red tips there's legals

1190
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:43,100
and others involved on it and you want

1191
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:45,140
to convince them like security will be

1192
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,520
fine with the group happens then but

1193
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,170
then you want to convince a legal team

1194
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,000
like hey these groups are something you

1195
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:53,000
can trust they're not malicious groups

1196
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,350
they're not not anonymous like you know

1197
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,750
some kind of hacking group out there

1198
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:58,790
that's going to pawn us and then share

1199
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:00,860
our data on darknets or something like

1200
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:02,210
that so the more we create the more we

1201
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,770
power give the publicity to we're

1202
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:06,310
packing the better it will get for

1203
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,310
everyone

1204
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:15,000
Eero not a quick question did you run

1205
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:16,380
into any like resistance because some of

1206
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,390
the ways you were getting inward through

1207
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,280
third-party services and on a custom

1208
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,140
application that the clients actually

1209
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,860
had or the programs it actually

1210
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:28,140
developed yes so there was a particular

1211
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:30,660
instance where we reported the verne

1212
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,279
ability so there's like a really I guess

1213
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,920
like a good learning thing that we had

1214
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,960
is we reported the bug and the company

1215
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,800
for some reason thought it was a send us

1216
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,290
for an ability so basically what

1217
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,730
happened was they reported into Zenda

1218
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,340
saying hey this is your plan were

1219
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:49,170
getting attacked but in the end it was

1220
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,640
not like as andis fly at all it was a

1221
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:53,130
feature they had you know it was not

1222
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,589
like it was designed to be a feature in

1223
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:57,690
general so like nothing you called fix

1224
00:46:55,590 --> 00:47:00,050
or Nothing send us had to fix but

1225
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:02,520
because the Zen Destin got it as a

1226
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:05,700
potential like hacking attempts going on

1227
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,110
they asked hacker on like hey what is

1228
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,089
this hacker doing like he's attacking

1229
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:11,430
our buttons those companies or our

1230
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:13,200
clients and what's going on so we had to

1231
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,490
like we have a couple of resistance from

1232
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,890
those programs where they're like you're

1233
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:20,549
attacking son that's not us explain to

1234
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:22,799
us like why this is our issue so what we

1235
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:24,600
did in doing that and this is like where

1236
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,700
the report writing concept comes to work

1237
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,080
it is you want to tell them exactly what

1238
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,960
you did and you don't want to tell them

1239
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:33,330
like any extra stuff that's not

1240
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,850
necessarily so what we told them was hey

1241
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,620
this is yours in this instance and we

1242
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:40,380
understand you think this is an esper

1243
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:42,029
nobility but this is where Sendas tells

1244
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,370
it's not their burn ability and we told

1245
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:45,990
them like about send us documents where

1246
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:48,540
they clearly mentioned it was a feature

1247
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:50,310
and the supporting looked into it

1248
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,600
afterwards like security and look into

1249
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:53,070
it and they said oh yeah

1250
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,259
we thought we fixed this but turns out

1251
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:57,510
someone disabled the feature again so

1252
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,640
that's like we're a couple of resistance

1253
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:01,770
came on there was one particular

1254
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,540
resistance where because this was an

1255
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:06,330
ongoing research like we're looking into

1256
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,400
how kids were this further so we were

1257
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:12,029
able to use the emails to get access to

1258
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,770
like a specific third-party I do not

1259
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,660
have the permission from anyone on that

1260
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:18,270
yet side and I am NOT going to man

1261
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:20,040
the third party yet but basically we've

1262
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:22,200
got access to that company's third party

1263
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,210
and then we let them know on the report

1264
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,279
saying like hey we were you know not for

1265
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:28,080
that specific company but we're testing

1266
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,840
it on our own instance and we got into

1267
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,460
our own isense third party system and we

1268
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,980
let them know saying hey like we're able

1269
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,690
to verify this works on this system - we

1270
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,210
ask you to kindly like verify that as

1271
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,830
well and they first thought we exploded

1272
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,390
against them so they're like hey please

1273
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:45,000
stop doing this research like this is

1274
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:46,799
making hard first fix stuff so we had

1275
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,200
that kind of resistance where I think

1276
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,430
more of it is like miscommunication

1277
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,779
trying to like let them know if

1278
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:54,899
something else and they understand

1279
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:57,750
something else on it so that was a like

1280
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:59,330
kind of a bad side of it research so

1281
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:02,700
there were a couple of moments like that

1282
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:05,130
but there was also really good moment

1283
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:08,129
the report is not public yet I really

1284
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:11,070
hope it goes public is we reported it to

1285
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:12,960
the company and they are Brist in Europe

1286
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:15,600
so when we reported it it was like 12:00

1287
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,850
p.m. like it was midnight or two L a.m.

1288
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,580
it was midnight there and there stas

1289
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:23,310
person involved in that program god

1290
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,200
objects it was critical for them and he

1291
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,910
started looking into it and we had like

1292
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,189
a really lengthy communication back and

1293
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:30,779
forth on how to fix it so like we're

1294
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,940
discussing like he was talking what he

1295
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,620
was seeing on his side and we're mensen

1296
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,480
like what we're testing so it was like a

1297
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,910
really good conversation between our

1298
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,820
teams and in the end like it has been a

1299
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:43,980
really good kind of communications with

1300
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:46,470
them that I like I really hope I can do

1301
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:48,000
with other programs so I'm really hoping

1302
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,609
like once they close the report as a

1303
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,230
result that we can public it and show it

1304
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,300
to the world like how companies to

1305
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,800
approach this environments or like this

1306
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,680
kind of situation because you don't

1307
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,540
usually see you know like for example

1308
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,000
Travis CI you don't usually see that

1309
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,529
come up like every day and when you get

1310
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,850
those kind of words like how do you deal

1311
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:07,560
with that do you like to steal with

1312
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:09,660
saying like hey thanks and then don't do

1313
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,680
anything else or do it like talk with

1314
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,240
the resources because they are

1315
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,430
researching on that and kind of

1316
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,140
understand their perspective while they

1317
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:18,180
are researching it what they have found

1318
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,890
fixes the vulnerability and go on

1319
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,839
through that so that's something I

1320
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:28,430
really hope I can share once it gets

1321
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:28,430
public cool

1322
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:39,200
Rohan as a link or as talked about Edie

1323
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:42,270
had overflows in team their research on

1324
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,919
sea ice and I just posted the link in

1325
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:45,780
the chat for you guys in case she hadn't

1326
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,040
read it it was pretty good yeah I highly

1327
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,260
recommend reading that it was really

1328
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,450
nice to look at it and like understand

1329
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:54,840
what they were doing it because travesty

1330
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:56,700
is something I've found out about quite

1331
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,380
a while ago and I was like interested to

1332
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,870
see if that'll happen but I never got to

1333
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,400
it and went and published a blog it was

1334
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,609
like perfect thing because I wanted to

1335
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,809
learn that for a while

1336
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,809
