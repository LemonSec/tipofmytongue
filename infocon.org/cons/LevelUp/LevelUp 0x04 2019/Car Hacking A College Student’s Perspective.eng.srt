1
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,519
all right yep you are

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:20,799
I'll give your quick intro suspect errs

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:23,200
here he his talk is car hacking a

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,390
college students perspective in this

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,730
presentation Nikhil will provide an

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,400
overview of targets and show some car

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,489
hacks will also go through common tools

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,589
we can all use to accomplish our goals

9
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,959
so yes thank you so much everyone for

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,150
sticking with us this is the last talk

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:46,120
of level up and we're ending on a good

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:48,580
one so take us away Neko excitement yeah

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,379
Jason if it did you wanted to jump in

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,729
I'm sorry about that no no I was just

15
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:57,010
hurting out I'm super excited about the

16
00:00:51,729 --> 00:01:00,640
talk well thank you yes I'm I'm Nika I'm

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:03,220
you know 23 college student I hacked

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,290
cars and I've you know I've done a bunch

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,840
of private bug bounties with Jason and

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,610
Sam they know me and a couple of my

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,049
friends kind of well because I I'm

22
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,740
always trying to bring people out and do

23
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:17,229
carking stuff with me so uh hope you

24
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,179
guys enjoy so you know before we start

25
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:22,030
there are a couple of things that you

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,649
should not do and one of those is uh you

27
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,469
know don't go out and steal cars after I

28
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:28,509
teach you how to steal cars cool so um

29
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:30,640
you know a couple of things please play

30
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:32,350
with your own toys share as much

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,240
information as possible it's super

32
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,850
useful for the community

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,359
do not break NDA's while sharing

34
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,530
information um as a lot of that is

35
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,839
involved in bug bounties and such as

36
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,240
previous people have said but you know

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,420
trying to be like as general as possible

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,759
help people reach out you guys can

39
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,770
always reach out to me or my friends um

40
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,810
we're always trying to get more people

41
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,039
interested in car acting it's really fun

42
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,240
and people always come with new in

43
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,100
different perspectives so it's always

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,479
good to have and you know most

45
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,428
importantly have fun while doing it

46
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,619
because car hacking is one of the most

47
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:10,030
rewarding experiences you can have the

48
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:13,720
yeah a little bit about Who I am my name

49
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,819
is Nico my handle is specters uh I am

50
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,250
currently studying cybersecurity I

51
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,929
wouldn't say I am like a full-fledged

52
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,819
hacker yet because I still have a lot

53
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,069
that I can improve on personally but you

54
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,380
know that's always a goal right so I'm

55
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,880
always working

56
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,740
towards and trying to meet my own

57
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,140
personal goals to say like I am now a

58
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,610
full-fledged hacker I skateboarded my

59
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,220
spare time

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,270
my OPSEC is complete garbage so uh you

61
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,620
know one of those goals I have to meet

62
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,290
um and once again at cars for fun so

63
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,780
what's this talk about um mostly it's

64
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,609
going to be about like hacking cars on a

65
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,430
tight budget because when I first got

66
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,080
into this um I was obviously in college

67
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,660
I have a bunch of loans that I need to

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,640
pay off for school so you know I didn't

69
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,630
have a lot of money at the time so there

70
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,040
are ways to get around these issues by

71
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,320
you know building your own hardware

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,910
using open-source tools there's a ton of

73
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,190
things out there and we're gonna go over

74
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,540
a little bit of those in the slide as

75
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,910
well as like more expensive tools that I

76
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,120
eventually adopted um as I was getting

77
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,380
like more and more bounties submitted so

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,390
I'm more specifically we're gonna go

79
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,210
over car basics we're gonna go through

80
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,160
my personal methodology of hacking into

81
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,830
cars which we'll touch on later after we

82
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,210
go into getting initial access I'm gonna

83
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,150
talk about tools I'm gonna talk about

84
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,460
software and then I'm going to tell you

85
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,900
guys how you can get on to cars and then

86
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,770
maybe after that I have a little bit of

87
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,040
time to possibly show a usable simulator

88
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:43,050
and like how to get onto the canvas how

89
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,079
to drop root shells on IOT devices and

90
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:49,290
like radio systems so go over that in a

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,900
minute so uh recommended knowledge these

92
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,000
are not required because I definitely

93
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,550
don't know all of these but uh it will

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,380
help you in just car hacking and in

95
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,300
general right so you always want to keep

96
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,190
learning so having a basic basic

97
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,880
understanding of how car works and how

98
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,040
it operates

99
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,750
um because then you can like choose

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,329
specifically what you want to target

101
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,790
like nobody's gonna care if you change

102
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,590
the tire sensor value or like the air

103
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,600
pressure value of your tires to zero on

104
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,250
a car it's like Oh whoo

105
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,140
you're making alerts happen on the

106
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,329
system but you know people are gonna

107
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,669
care if you like legitimately like maybe

108
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,950
a mess around with the trends and it

109
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:28,530
breaks something because that'll be like

110
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:32,070
a big issue after that so we're gonna go

111
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,210
over uh well I mean

112
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,490
having an understanding of like just

113
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,010
different protocols like ADB SSH tell

114
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,930
that being able to reverse engineer is a

115
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,159
really big one that I personally am

116
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,680
struggling with that I'm always trying

117
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:49,350
to build on um a lot of car systems use

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,820
different programming languages it's

119
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,160
it's pretty much all over the place in

120
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,130
terms of development some use like an

121
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,140
Android front-end or like an Android

122
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,750
like system and then some will use like

123
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,150
some random Linux kernel rights like for

124
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,930
example Tesla uses a food to

125
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,599
mind-blowing write they write their own

126
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:11,190
C C++ code to run their own personalized

127
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,260
software's which is also really cool so

128
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,360
we're gonna go over car basics as you

129
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:20,130
could probably tell cars have computers

130
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:24,710
I know right whoo so this is actually an

131
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:27,090
ECU so an ECU is pretty much a car's a

132
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,250
way of handling different types of

133
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,580
messages between sensors it's like the

134
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,230
liaison between those two so this will

135
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,050
pretty much direct each sensor where to

136
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,620
go how to respond this stores all of its

137
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,630
uh sensor information and you can pretty

138
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,990
much like reprogram different cars and

139
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,810
different sensors with this did you mean

140
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,210
introduction to e C's as you can see

141
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,890
these are like a Diagnostics center

142
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,169
right in the center that is an ECU and

143
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:59,430
this communicates with you know exhaust

144
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,480
gas oxygen sensors tons of things so you

145
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,110
know there could be hundreds of sensors

146
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,910
in a car that you can mess around with

147
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,340
engine control unit is what ECU means

148
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,140
and it has two-way communications so you

149
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,690
can actually have a center receive

150
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,840
values for all of this so that's really

151
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,490
cool because if I send uh let's say a

152
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,080
value to unlock the doors well now I

153
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,920
just got into the car now I'm stealing

154
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,090
the car right so you know there's here's

155
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,870
an example of pretty much a canned

156
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:30,020
message that we have up here

157
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,090
so pretty much uh like you could have

158
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,539
multiple sensors in a single can message

159
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,460
and this value right here which is one

160
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,400
two three is that specific sensor and

161
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,900
then these values control something on

162
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,210
that specific sensor so that specific

163
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,888
sensor can be used for one part of the

164
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:50,690
car but it controls multiple things on

165
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:52,520
that so you know like engine oil right

166
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,050
so it could tell you the levels of

167
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,539
engine oil it can tell you the heat and

168
00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:00,169
a couple of other values that would be

169
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,680
mixed in there as well so car radios are

170
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:05,599
also computers very interesting I know

171
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,790
this is actually an Android auto system

172
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,620
that I personally want to build but

173
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,180
people have already built out so really

174
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,190
easy to set up you can buy Raspberry Pi

175
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,800
you can buy a screen and you can start

176
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,050
practicing like messing around with some

177
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,360
of the like kernel stuff that you could

178
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:25,880
do once you get an initial foothold onto

179
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:28,250
the system so what type of systems do

180
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,570
infotainment systems run and

181
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,860
infotainment systems by the way our car

182
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,110
radio sorry if I get a little confusing

183
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,430
first off we've Android made by Google

184
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,960
so it follows a couple of Google

185
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,160
standards which is pointed out by one of

186
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,900
my friends buses can fly Q and X which

187
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
is surprisingly made by blackberry

188
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,150
it's a Linux sub kernel really

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,160
interesting and used on a ton of cars so

190
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,330
you know definitely uh you could

191
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,470
download it for free online like a

192
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,719
developer version you could start

193
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,740
messing around with that do we have

194
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,740
Windows automotive

195
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,040
it's alright I i I've seen cars habit

196
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,680
and they have very silly things

197
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,910
associated with them but uh hopefully

198
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,590
that could flush out in the future and

199
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,450
then we have a boon tube which obviously

200
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:13,619
I think by now everyone knows that Tesla

201
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,940
cars have a up into uh you know a Linux

202
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,490
distribution on to their infotainment

203
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,770
systems like the giant pad screen what

204
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,800
protocols are on all these systems glad

205
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:26,400
yes uh first off we've Google our we

206
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,280
have a TB on Android so a TB is pretty

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,530
much how you can drop local shells for

208
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,799
debugging Android information or to like

209
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:37,049
add programs do a couple of things a lot

210
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,968
of people who are hacking Android

211
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,010
devices will pretty much drop ADB shells

212
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:44,250
onto these devices and then like you

213
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:46,740
know send pools to get a apk files or

214
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,030
something of that sort right pretty much

215
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,530
again applications and things like that

216
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:53,040
or to mess around with the kernel a

217
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:55,709
little bit um SSH very common protocol

218
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,079
it's used to just remote in sometimes

219
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,970
it's

220
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,060
locally within the car or it could be

221
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,860
externally over like you know GSM why

222
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,349
fire anything else right uh

223
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:10,430
like it can be over like a telephone

224
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:13,910
network Q and X also has SSH windows

225
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:16,219
surprisingly has RDP and SSH abouttwo is

226
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,939
SSH and obviously everyone's favorite

227
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,010
all of them have telnet which is

228
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,690
sometimes really ridiculous it's almost

229
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,000
like developers specifically want to

230
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,380
pick on you can those security people

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,210
and they're like where did you use an

232
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,200
outdated version of telnet and it's

233
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,330
gonna drop straight into a root shell

234
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,500
which is something I saw on Twitter

235
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:38,810
recently with a another car that had

236
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,060
like a Windows distribution on it so I

237
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,579
was also really cool a couple the

238
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:49,310
interfaces so once again we have Wi-Fi

239
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:51,230
USB LTE GSM all these like wireless ways

240
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,949
to get into the cars I've seen stuff

241
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:59,000
over HDMI um I've seen Tesla's own like

242
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:02,270
Ethernet to weird adapter type port um

243
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,290
so there's a tons of tons of different

244
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,290
ways that you could like mess around

245
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,839
with the interfaces on cars and a lot of

246
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,180
cars have really interesting things like

247
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,490
associated with them so I've seen

248
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,140
examples of interesting interfaces like

249
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,060
you could tap a corner of the screen

250
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,189
four or five times and it would open up

251
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,959
a show and it would just give you root

252
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,510
access to a car and like that's

253
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,190
something that a lot of vehicle

254
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,020
manufacturers are like looking out for

255
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,430
now so you won't see it as much but

256
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,990
these things still exist out in the

257
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:35,900
world so my methodology well we're gonna

258
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,170
talk about goals first so what are some

259
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,630
of the goals that you want to accomplish

260
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,550
um just getting you know actually want

261
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,530
to light a car on fire um but I'm sure

262
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,170
if you did you would make tons of money

263
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,949
like tons of hush money because uh they

264
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:53,660
would be like don't tell anyone ever

265
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,420
um oh yeah so the goal is either

266
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,939
compromise user data so we pretty much

267
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,890
want to like jump on to let's say an

268
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,380
Android system and start messing around

269
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,670
with you know the users personal

270
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,560
information like where they live where

271
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,819
they're going what are the last three

272
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,770
places they visited what's their current

273
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,950
GPS location these are all things you

274
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,319
can do inside

275
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,790
some of these radio systems as I you can

276
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,490
totally just like docks that person and

277
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,990
find out everything about them if you

278
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,600
could do that remotely that's like a big

279
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,339
deal to a lot of people um just because

280
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,639
like you could start tracking very

281
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:28,889
important people so another thing is you

282
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,459
can try to gain access to one of the

283
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:35,510
many car computers so getting external

284
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:38,219
access to ECU's wireless access to ECU's

285
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:40,860
pretty much means that you have a way

286
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,570
that you can damage the car um in some

287
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,160
cases there are firewalls that try to

288
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,810
prevent this but if you can circumvent

289
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,279
that firewall that's also another big

290
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,489
bounty that like you just got for

291
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,480
yourself um so you know there's a

292
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,130
standard out in the u.s. of allowing

293
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,600
engineers and like local automotive

294
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,089
shops to be able to read data from the

295
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
ECU's um so this comes with you know

296
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:04,769
obviously games and applause alright

297
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,229
like you're letting a ton of people be

298
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:09,360
able to rebuild cards do everything with

299
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,730
cars that they need to you but you're

300
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,699
also giving them partial access to the

301
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,920
cars computers and this becomes an issue

302
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:18,870
just like when someone says it ECU reset

303
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,760
to the car there are some functionality

304
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,199
you can lose if somebody's like in the

305
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,620
middle of driving you hack their car

306
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:27,479
radio and you send that message um so

307
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,810
it's always really interesting things to

308
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:34,079
look at so getting remote or local route

309
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,609
on an infotainment system uh once again

310
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,640
this goes with the other two things

311
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,829
which is if you gain its if you jump

312
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,839
onto a radio system to get use your data

313
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:45,899
or if you jump on there to send messages

314
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,390
to the car specifically um you're pretty

315
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:53,910
much gonna be able to control the car in

316
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:55,319
multiple ways excuse me so if you can

317
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,870
find a way to make it easier to steal a

318
00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:00,719
car such as unlocking doors and starting

319
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,769
a car that's also a big deal um a lot of

320
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,459
companies will look at that and be like

321
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:07,410
okay there's gonna be like you know a

322
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,060
big publicity around this or people are

323
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,189
gonna start stealing cars and you know

324
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,859
certain areas or you know all over the

325
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,930
place um or they're just gonna do for

326
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,120
fun right like this is these are things

327
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,939
that companies will think about and just

328
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,840
in terms of car aking if you can hack or

329
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:27,810
clone key fobs this is like also you

330
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,480
deal just because you could potentially

331
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,160
clone or you could like hack the entropy

332
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,660
to some key fobs and you could just

333
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,640
start unlocking all the certain like

334
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,490
specific cars that were made by the

335
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,530
specific company um also very big deal

336
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,910
you don't want that so you definitely

337
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,829
don't want that information shared oh

338
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,839
yeah so these are some of the goals that

339
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:49,290
you know as hacker myself I'm trying to

340
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:52,560
accomplish while I'm hacking cars so how

341
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,689
do we uh how do we practice this um it's

342
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,180
kind of hard for myself as a college

343
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,160
student to be like hey I'm just gonna go

344
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,290
buy this car and start doing research on

345
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,140
it which you know that's a legitimate

346
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:06,540
thing that people can do um you can

347
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,880
borrow a friend's car I've had multiple

348
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,319
instances so far where I was interested

349
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,200
in Tesla hacking and I had somebody

350
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,670
reach out to me that was like hey um I'm

351
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,440
you know I'm interested in adding these

352
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,020
binaries to my Tesla I will let you hack

353
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,290
my car if you can help me try to figure

354
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:24,510
this out and you know like dropping root

355
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,069
shells on Tesla's is cool and being able

356
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,200
to just hack that car is just such a

357
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:31,020
great experience that I can go like use

358
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,860
it somewhere else um you know obviously

359
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,600
you could buy the car there are

360
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,700
researchers that will like legitimately

361
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,350
like rent the car buy the car park it in

362
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,050
there likes garage and then just sort of

363
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,550
like doing stuff on it I have access to

364
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:45,750
a garage because I'm friends what I'm

365
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:47,370
like a local automotive person so he

366
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,800
lets me use his garage to like lift cars

367
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,200
mess around with it sometimes and then I

368
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,790
get to like take that research go home

369
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,110
usually I just like read can messages

370
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,360
and then replay them at home to try to

371
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,250
figure out like you know which Seuss's

372
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,620
became us to just work with specific

373
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,580
sensors and things like that um you can

374
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,500
buy parts that you think are exploitable

375
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,120
so you know you could buy ECU's online

376
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,740
and you could buy radio infotainment

377
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,350
systems online just a quick google

378
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,750
search of the specific year make and

379
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,310
model of the car and then what part it

380
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,810
is and then you just go on eBay or you

381
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,630
go anywhere else you could just buy it

382
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:24,390
um ECU's usually range like anywhere

383
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:26,610
from that need to like two to three

384
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,230
hundred dollars right so buying one is a

385
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,690
little bit harder but uh to circumvent

386
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,000
that you just go to a junkyard this is

387
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,980
my favorite thing to do you just go to a

388
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,240
junkyard and you rip one out and then

389
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,910
you try to convince the person that

390
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,529
you're you know bartering with because

391
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,899
you know ECU's are a common thing that

392
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:45,029
people just take from junkyards um and

393
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,829
you can just like be like hey you know

394
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,630
I'll buy this a piece of metal for $20

395
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:50,459
you know trying to convince if you're

396
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,100
gonna scrap it or something

397
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:57,930
but it works more often than not which

398
00:15:53,100 --> 00:16:01,230
is usually a really fun time so a couple

399
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:03,779
of the tools we use though I

400
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,399
there's tons of tools out there um

401
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,560
obviously I'm not going to mention all

402
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,060
of them in this slide I am going to

403
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,199
however mention like a couple Oh teach

404
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,790
cheap ones that I like personally

405
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:17,699
so just for communicating with the can

406
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:21,360
bus or the obd2 port we have the

407
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:23,310
contacts the Knable Minton net who is a

408
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,350
another researcher that made his own

409
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,000
hardware if you meet him I think you can

410
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,529
actually just ask him for one of his

411
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,769
business cards he might give you one for

412
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,959
free

413
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,190
might have to convince him um and then

414
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,258
he'll tell you how to like create the

415
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,779
hardware great researcher great dude

416
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:40,589
knows what he's doing um value can is

417
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:42,420
another one value can is made mostly for

418
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:45,209
window systems and like they have like

419
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,670
other versions of the value can that can

420
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,619
work with like Linux kernels and stuff

421
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,389
but pretty much it's it's a little bit

422
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,449
more expensive but you get the nice

423
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:57,089
software package with it that pretty

424
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:59,969
much gives you like ease of use easier

425
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:01,560
functionality easier setup it gives you

426
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,459
like a whole really nice GUI where you

427
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,339
don't have to really type a lot of

428
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:07,168
commands so if you're trying to it may

429
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:09,780
be like an introduction of car hacking I

430
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:11,339
know that intrepid systems goes to

431
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,949
DEFCON and they reduce the price of

432
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,928
their value can stuff you can go and

433
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,780
like buy one there you can go to a local

434
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:20,220
con maybe that intrepid zet and try to

435
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,859
buy one off of them other than that on

436
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,150
the website that's listed for $150 and

437
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,339
up depending on which version you get

438
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:29,820
and they're really good I personally use

439
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:33,030
one I like it a lot um the new USB

440
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,789
toucan is out actually too so it's $69

441
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:39,480
um I bought one recently and I really

442
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:41,129
like it it works well um once again just

443
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,510
some of these things are a little bit

444
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,860
expensive if you're really just trying

445
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,780
to get an introduction to car hacking

446
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,639
and you kind of just want to like read

447
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,658
messages from a car and maybe mess

448
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,059
around with it a little bit I would

449
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:52,620
really suggest the can table very small

450
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,658
very lightweight

451
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,789
very easy setup gives you the whole

452
00:17:54,659 --> 00:18:00,270
guide online and everything about it is

453
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:01,770
super simple uh some key fob hardware if

454
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,570
you're trying to like clone or hack like

455
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:07,980
you know radio frequency stuff or like

456
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:10,830
car keys itself you could buy proxmark

457
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,730
proc smarts to like do a close range

458
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:17,100
attacks on them you could buy like blade

459
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,539
RFS or hack RFS or yardsticks to like

460
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,899
try to intercept messages you're doing

461
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:23,700
like rolling jams or things like that

462
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,100
most of the time people will intercept

463
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,140
messages and try to figure out how these

464
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,908
keys are doing these challenges in

465
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,730
response and these are all good tools to

466
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,809
use um once again though all of these

467
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,210
are really expensive I think all of

468
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:38,158
these are like a hundred plus dollars so

469
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,690
if you wanted to you could probably get

470
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,309
an SDR and still accomplish the same

471
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,100
goal you just have to make sure it's

472
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:45,720
under uh I think like one Giga heard to

473
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,668
uh be able to like read some of the

474
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,130
values you're like five hundred Meg's I

475
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,659
think is around usually what those

476
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,049
values are maybe a little higher or

477
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:57,929
lower from there yeah so some of the

478
00:18:55,049 --> 00:19:00,960
software we use for all UNIX ah UNIX and

479
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:04,049
Linux distributions um so for the RF key

480
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,580
stuff we have RF cat um I've seen some

481
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:08,039
great vulnerabilities get exposed with

482
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,408
this tool I've seen a bunch of crypto

483
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,460
stuff get cracked with this tool uh a

484
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:13,260
lot of great things have been

485
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,399
accomplished with this tool so I really

486
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,279
enjoyed that one there's a bunch of

487
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,779
other tools and there's a repo of a

488
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,299
awesome like car hacking stuff on github

489
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:23,760
which is also really great to look at

490
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:25,379
hacking Android tools uh obviously you

491
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,570
just want to get Android tools for ADB

492
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,899
access if you're gonna hack a can bus

493
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:33,120
you can use scape II which is like an

494
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:34,979
open-source Python repo that pretty much

495
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,779
lets you craft your own types of packets

496
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,570
and you could communicate to and from

497
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:41,190
the car with that tool um very cool it

498
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,799
supports can didn't know that until

499
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:48,870
recently can utils which is pretty much

500
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:52,679
a already written like it's like a repo

501
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:54,840
pretty much like C code that

502
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,429
communicates with the canvas so you have

503
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,100
like canned dump which will display a

504
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,020
bunch of things can player which can

505
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,120
actually replay log files from can dump

506
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,668
specifically can send which can send

507
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,389
single and multiple messages can gen

508
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:08,910
which

509
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,980
you can actually brute-force a bunch of

510
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:14,190
specific sensors and stuff and sniffer

511
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:18,930
which gives you a nice like display to

512
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:22,500
view all these messages messages so to

513
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,820
get o to pretty much set up we have sake

514
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,140
cannon nestled kin which is uh

515
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,020
dependencies that you're going to need

516
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,580
so you need the daemon for some kin

517
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,590
interfaces and stuff which comes with

518
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,360
kin utils I think it just comes

519
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:37,379
precompiled on the SE package once you

520
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,820
set it up Doe software for Windows once

521
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,640
again you have RF cat because it's open

522
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,770
source it should work on both may take a

523
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,710
little bit more setup you have can't act

524
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,270
the application which is a prebuilt

525
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,590
application that you just download on

526
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:52,290
your computer and then you use it to you

527
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,740
communicate stuff I can utils once again

528
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:57,149
which has all those other C code tools

529
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,800
Wireshark actually reads canned stuff as

530
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:02,930
well because it communicates over serial

531
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,790
though and you can plug right into USB

532
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:08,340
you can also download ADB for Windows

533
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:12,930
computers giving you shells that you can

534
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:15,990
drop on to you know Android systems we

535
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,110
have vehicle spy which is like the

536
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:22,020
really nice version that intrepid owns

537
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:24,449
and this like this is like a free trial

538
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,340
for it pretty much but this is one of

539
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,960
the easier systems so if you've had more

540
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,120
money and you wanted to car hack a

541
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,520
little bit easier replay messages easier

542
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,979
and stuff you have vehicles Y that you

543
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,790
can pretty much use once again cost

544
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,140
comes with ease of use right so um then

545
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,550
we have scape II again which you can

546
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,580
craft your own messages and just

547
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,680
communicate what's things so what I

548
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,370
carry on me personally I have a value

549
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:53,460
can for Windows with vehicle spy I think

550
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,020
I have version for um so it specifically

551
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,990
only works for Windows I have not

552
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:00,900
figured out how to set up the Linux

553
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,550
driver that they had for it I think it

554
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,880
is online gonna have to ask somebody

555
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:08,040
later cane table once again this was

556
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,200
like my quick easy introduction to car

557
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,220
hacking with that especially when I like

558
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,070
wanted to switch over to more

559
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:17,280
open-source tools I use that minty nets

560
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:20,189
nano can and he has another tool but uh

561
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,480
the ESP like 32 can communicate

562
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,149
device which is listed on the right

563
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,590
those are some pictures of that tool I

564
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:30,870
carry a USB 2.0 cable Taipei to Taipei

565
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,908
and pretty much that's just like if cars

566
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:36,239
have USB there's some cases where you

567
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:38,940
plug into that USB and it'll like trying

568
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,259
to assign you an IP or it you know has a

569
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,929
shell that you could run through through

570
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:45,720
ADB um tons of different things that you

571
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:47,840
can do just to get onto system so I also

572
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,659
have USB to Ethernet which once again

573
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,509
the president Lee some cars have IP is

574
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:56,850
being assigned over USB stuff so what

575
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:58,320
you connect up to it it just you can

576
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,860
like scan a bunch of stuff and then try

577
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,860
to drop shells

578
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:06,379
I also carry a logic analyzer there's a

579
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,500
couple online that are really cheap only

580
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:12,430
like a couple of dollars uh let's see

581
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,200
which one do I have oh it's in Chinese

582
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:17,630
pretty much I like one on eBay or like

583
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,830
Alibaba and bought mine I think I

584
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,360
ordered mine for eight dollars it was

585
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,189
two dollars shipping and handling so ten

586
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,860
they were from ten to fifteen dollars in

587
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,690
total um really good tool really good to

588
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,729
have I really want to get a say Lee won

589
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,760
but stop willing to spend that much

590
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:34,820
I carry a soldering iron I carry pins

591
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,440
wires solder obviously and I carry you

592
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,750
are two USB which is used for hardware

593
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,640
hacking um and then I also carry two

594
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,490
laptops one Linux and one Windows I

595
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,990
specifically use peridot us because it

596
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,660
just comes with all the tools that I

597
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,550
need for carking precompiled but I have

598
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:52,610
also used like pen two in the past which

599
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:56,480
is a Gen 2 security distribution um I

600
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:58,879
just like hated my life when I tried to

601
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,840
compile anything else especially drivers

602
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,160
so I stopped using it so some of the

603
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:09,240
canvas basics

604
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,320
so pretty much we have a DW Ken which is

605
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,030
a dual wire Ken

606
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,530
so essentially what we're gonna do is

607
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,750
we're gonna take two wires we're gonna

608
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,399
plug them into specific ports and that

609
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,890
should give us Ken messages so as you

610
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:24,480
can see isone are not yeah

611
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:26,580
iso fifteen seven six five minus four is

612
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,010
pretty much the can hi can low port

613
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,300
switch is used on most vehicles um so

614
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,620
essentially you could just take two

615
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,870
wires you could plug them in and then

616
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,949
you can start you know doing a

617
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:40,169
numeration you can get a logic analyzer

618
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,560
and analyze some of the can messages i'm

619
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:44,820
they're just really cool and then these

620
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,440
are just like grabs explaining how they

621
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,700
work there's a lot of things involved

622
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,740
with can and there's a lot of different

623
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,450
ways that it communicates so don't take

624
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,420
this graph and like think it's just

625
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,710
gonna work instantly some cars have

626
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,440
security systems in place to try to

627
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,780
prevent you sending T X messages right

628
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,850
which is a transmitted messages or you

629
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,230
know some cars will have specific like

630
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,370
values you'll need to send just to

631
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:10,440
receive messages right so so this one

632
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,209
it's a little bit more complicated these

633
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,210
are pretty much the structure of ten

634
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,970
messages so here in the top right image

635
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,620
on the left side we have first off the

636
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:22,050
start of the frame which is almost

637
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,689
always gonna start with the zero and

638
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,090
then we have the arbitration field the

639
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:30,660
arbitration field is pretty much like a

640
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,280
sensor ID so essentially when we go into

641
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,680
the arbitration field and we're looking

642
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,899
at it but we add up these ones and zeros

643
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,450
and we come back with a sensor specific

644
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,930
sensor that can control you know who

645
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,190
knows what

646
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:44,580
unless it's listed somewhere in

647
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:47,970
documents after that we have RTR which

648
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,080
is remote transmission request which I

649
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,520
personally haven't used and that's

650
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,669
usually always set to zero for me as

651
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,129
well um but there are cases where you

652
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,440
could use them and that's listed in like

653
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,850
like CSS electronics or you can go to si

654
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,370
use website and read the standard for

655
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,510
those we have control fields which

656
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,010
pretty much just tells you like the

657
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,800
length of the message that you're about

658
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:11,460
to get or send we have the data field

659
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:15,240
which is all your sensor values so like

660
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,590
if you had FF which is 255 you're pretty

661
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,080
much telling this Pacifica Center it's

662
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,470
you go to max value or to do something

663
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,539
right and most of the time when ECU's

664
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:27,330
are programmed usually programmed to do

665
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:31,100
like a greater than x value or their

666
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:34,408
program to meet a specific value so

667
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,119
doing FF on like fuzzing with ffs is

668
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:39,299
sometimes really good and could just be

669
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:43,320
quick to identify some card utilities

670
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:45,570
like what they do and I personally use

671
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,249
it to like find out which one is gonna

672
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,918
be like unlocking the door which is

673
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:51,720
usually 1c0 so my arbitration field

674
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,869
would be one c0 and then I'd spam it I

675
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,269
swam all the data fields with SF's and

676
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:58,619
it'll knock the doors um and then after

677
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:00,419
that we just have the normal like

678
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:03,928
acknowledge field and a frame field in

679
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:05,190
the communication field um so yeah and

680
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:09,169
then down here in the bottom left we

681
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:12,269
have 29 bit messages which are longer

682
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:14,820
sensor IDs but shorter data fields or

683
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:17,399
the same data length data fields but

684
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,100
just longer Center IDs so you could

685
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:21,928
pretty much add a ton more sensors in a

686
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:27,269
car with these um so these are both

687
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:30,600
standards under I say 91 41 I believe so

688
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:33,419
Handy's used in a ton of things um I

689
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,369
have some of them listed above but most

690
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:39,899
of the ones I use obviously our car obd2

691
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:41,970
port scan FD um I have actually seen a

692
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:45,479
lot of you know construction devices

693
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:47,460
have canned messages on them um and I've

694
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,009
also seen Hospital devices use canned

695
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,509
messages which is kind of crazy to me so

696
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:56,580
tan is used on just tons of different uh

697
00:27:53,509 --> 00:28:00,509
just tons of different machinery which

698
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,509
is really cool so getting initial access

699
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:05,399
to a car once again we're gonna want to

700
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:08,820
start from the outside and make our way

701
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:10,018
into the car right so the first thing

702
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,269
that people are usually gonna think of

703
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:13,859
is the key fob or like I want to be able

704
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:16,080
to unlock the door with the key fob and

705
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:18,629
I want to be able to you get access to

706
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,769
the car well there's already great

707
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:24,748
research done on that and I've seen it

708
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:26,419
done I personally don't do a lot of RF

709
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:29,070
stuff but I'm trying to learn currently

710
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:31,169
um but you know you're obviously needed

711
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:33,419
like good crypto skills you're gonna be

712
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:35,580
able to take

713
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,410
I guess RF data and be able to like

714
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,960
clone specific keys or you can like

715
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,540
crack like specific like hardware values

716
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,670
that is being generated on keys and then

717
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,710
you could just like break into cars so

718
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:49,170
in one of the Tesla examples which is

719
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,720
like the Tesla key fob peg we actually

720
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,820
have Leonard he's walking by and he

721
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,250
takes in a proxmark and he cloned

722
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,500
somebody's ID then he goes back to the

723
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,120
car and then he uses that to pretty much

724
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,530
unlock the car or take it and steal it

725
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:06,270
uh which is really awesome I've it was

726
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,230
like my first time seeing it I thought

727
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,350
it was the coolest thing in the world

728
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:12,960
you could find that online websites list

729
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,610
below obviously and there's a lot of

730
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,280
great research that Leonard puts into

731
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:19,340
that so I would definitely defer to him

732
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,168
on any of the key fob car hacking stuff

733
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:26,340
though what types of car centers do we

734
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:29,940
have so externally to the vehicle we

735
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:32,309
will have pretty much like lidar or

736
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,500
we'll have like some weird infrared

737
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:36,000
camera that like no guides car in

738
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,400
specific directions and stuff or even

739
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,370
like cars tire sensors that we can get

740
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,049
access to the vehicle with um finding

741
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,639
like external parts of the car and

742
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:47,070
making your way in is really interesting

743
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,350
just because you know like I could grab

744
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:50,850
a car tire sensor and I can plug

745
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,129
directly into that and then I can lock

746
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,379
the doors I can start the car maybe I

747
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,090
could drive the car away um you know

748
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,370
usually like there's a mobilizers in

749
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:02,490
place for that but all of these things

750
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:04,168
are possible if I can get access to the

751
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,990
inside of the car and unlock the doors I

752
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:08,820
can pop the hood I can replace the ECU I

753
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,410
can take the car away like these are

754
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,270
these are all things that matter but I

755
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:14,880
won't be affecting multiple cars at once

756
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,440
so one of the big things in bug bounties

757
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,390
that's kind of shifting towards I think

758
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,059
of better changes you know instead of

759
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,040
affecting a single card you infect you

760
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,960
affect like hundreds of cars or

761
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,049
thousands of cars they've like other

762
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,520
sensors on the back like parking sensors

763
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:32,460
Tesla has like guidance sensors on the

764
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,540
front - like seer people I've seen there

765
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,700
was an example of somebody placing

766
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,440
stickers on the ground and may pretty

767
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,640
much make a Contessa like able to like

768
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,010
drive off the road or it was like

769
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,510
identifying it as something as like a

770
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:46,350
specific object that I needed to avoid

771
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:48,750
I'm also very interesting and then uh

772
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:50,610
you know we have like cars with a once

773
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,460
again like different types of radars GPS

774
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:55,199
lidar there's sometimes cameras that are

775
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,169
external but that one specifically had

776
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,220
an internal camera oh yeah these are one

777
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:00,509
of the things you could try to get

778
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,419
access to you just to get inside of the

779
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:05,820
car so next we have the obd2 port let me

780
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:07,320
get inside of the car um pretty much the

781
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,939
first place you're gonna go and you're

782
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,309
gonna want to look at is the obd2 port

783
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,700
why because you can pretty much

784
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:16,350
enumerate every possible value in obd2

785
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,909
or in these Ken messages and you can try

786
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,759
to identify all the different types of

787
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:24,320
centered sensors what they do how they

788
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:25,880
do it things like that

789
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,740
so uh this is just a quick slide on like

790
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,720
setting up CANbus hacking hardware not

791
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,850
gonna go over it but I have it in the

792
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:37,009
slides just so when people go back and

793
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:39,860
download it yeah so here's an example of

794
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:41,809
some canned messages so once again we

795
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,850
have our arbitration IDs which is like

796
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:45,918
one one one right at the top the length

797
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,658
is eight and these are some of the

798
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:52,549
values right so essentially like so one

799
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,259
c0 is a good one

800
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:55,850
once the zero is usually used to unlock

801
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:58,159
and lock and unlock doors

802
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:01,100
um and I always find that values like

803
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,139
spread across a lot of cars I think it

804
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:06,320
like involves like specific standards

805
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:11,389
probably or whatever it may be but if

806
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:14,509
you send value like four but I'm I like

807
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:17,240
for a um the car doors will lock if you

808
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:19,669
send for C the car doors will unblock

809
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,220
right so essentially you're just going

810
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:23,899
through and like fuzzing all of these uh

811
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:27,110
so once again just spamming ffs on these

812
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:29,719
to you these are all hex so or you can

813
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,519
do it in binary as well um spending like

814
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,200
a value larger than a specific value may

815
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,879
activate some functionality in the car

816
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,200
or you have to meet a specific value

817
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:38,449
which just requires a little bit of

818
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,049
brute forcing which these can messages

819
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:44,659
literally communicate at like 25

820
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:46,970
milliseconds or 250 milliseconds though

821
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:49,549
you have a lot of time this top one is

822
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:52,009
actually vehicle spy uh and this is

823
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:53,509
Intrepid's like specific system so it

824
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:56,809
pretty much gives you like everything

825
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:59,360
you need to know I actually handmade all

826
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:02,149
these text messages a couple nights ago

827
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,340
and I just wanted to kind of give you

828
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:07,399
like a visualization of what this tool

829
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:11,000
looks like at the bottom we have can

830
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:13,370
dump which once again is another tool

831
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,929
that's used on Linux instead and you

832
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,459
have the ARB IDs which are the sensor

833
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:18,679
IDs and then you have the length of the

834
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,379
messages and then you have these

835
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,600
specific messages themself so uh very

836
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:25,039
interesting slide to look at definitely

837
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,340
go out and try the tools yourself always

838
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,230
really good so getting initial access to

839
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,059
the infotainment system so this image

840
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,909
actually I thought I had the source

841
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:37,070
under it but apparently it kind of moved

842
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:38,090
this is the boon to system that's on the

843
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,639
Tesla cars

844
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,988
very cool somebody actually dropped a

845
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:43,879
root shell and you know we got these

846
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:47,210
images and stuff and we were pretty much

847
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:48,408
able to look at it I believe the way

848
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,999
they dropped the shell too was just

849
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:53,119
connecting that like specific Ethernet

850
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:55,609
cable and then uh yeah like they're

851
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,019
weird like interface cable that comes

852
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:58,999
out to Ethernet and connecting their

853
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:59,989
computer running a scan on it and then

854
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:02,599
found some open ports that they

855
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:03,830
eventually ended up exploiting don't

856
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,879
quote me on that because there's a bunch

857
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,668
of different ways you could do it you

858
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:09,980
can reflash portions of like chips on

859
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:13,299
there and that'll drop you into shells

860
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,319
I've seen a lot of people do that too

861
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:18,440
also a really good way to get initial

862
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:20,119
access so if we go back to this slide

863
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,039
and pretty much have all these protocols

864
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,950
once again let's try to keep this in

865
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:26,299
mind when we go into like those

866
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:27,949
infotainment systems you were trying to

867
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:29,690
get initial access right like we should

868
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:32,270
be doing the normal steps that it takes

869
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,579
to you get initial access to a computer

870
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:37,129
right if we're trying to get access to

871
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:38,779
the radio specifically because all it is

872
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:39,949
underlining is just gonna be like a

873
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:43,039
regular computer so you need to

874
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:44,509
enumerate it like you would um and then

875
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,329
just like scan it for exploits like

876
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:52,099
anything else Q and X doesn't have a

877
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:54,379
large I guess like database of exploits

878
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,879
for it there's been like more and more

879
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:59,270
release as time goes on just because

880
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,348
it's a widely used system but um you

881
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,000
know most of the time you're just gonna

882
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:03,680
find like weird miss configurations and

883
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,240
custom apps um

884
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,098
custom applications that are being made

885
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,899
by developers you're gonna find like

886
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:11,089
weird backdoors that developers make to

887
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,440
try to get access to a you know root

888
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:15,078
shell those are happening less

889
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,010
frequently too so as time goes on you're

890
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,109
gonna need really good reverse

891
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,059
engineering skills just to be able to

892
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:22,670
reverse like assembly code to make

893
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:24,740
exploits right like so now that all

894
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:28,460
these applications are moving to a less

895
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,990
uh you know a misconfigured way you're

896
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,299
gonna have to start finding exploits in

897
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,680
you know code right like buying

898
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:37,759
deprecated code that's used in these

899
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,129
things too maybe uh you know do a buffer

900
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,869
overflow and then execute shell code all

901
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:45,170
right like there's there's tons of

902
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:47,539
different ways to go about it and if all

903
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,869
else fails you pretty much have you know

904
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:52,369
once again your hardware hacking skills

905
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:54,109
so this is going to be like the day

906
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:57,619
underlining thing that you're gonna use

907
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:58,700
to at least get initial access right so

908
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:01,190
there's a bunch of different things you

909
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,618
do um you aren't in JTAG are still two

910
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,720
big things that can drop you and to you

911
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:09,200
at least use your shells um I've seen

912
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,828
cases where I've like gone to a radio

913
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,410
system

914
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:15,049
I got a UART shell on it and then it was

915
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,490
a root shell and it was like oh well

916
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:18,859
that just gave me access to you

917
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:20,180
literally everything I wanted and then

918
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:22,069
from there were pretty much once again

919
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,440
downloading custom apps reversing them

920
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:26,450
seeing how we can affect more than one

921
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,640
specific system how can I reach out to

922
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,899
you know back-end databases that this is

923
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,569
communicating with how can I still use

924
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:35,779
your data all things to keep in mind

925
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:37,339
right so to do this essentially all you

926
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:40,670
need is like four pins and you would

927
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:42,140
solder them do either here here and just

928
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,549
see what data comes out so I'd use like

929
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,490
a logic analyzer before just like

930
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:47,630
plugging directly into it and maybe this

931
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,720
will like drop you into a shell so

932
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,730
there's great resources online dev ttyS

933
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,788
zero comm is one of them that just

934
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:57,529
teaches you how to reverse serial ports

935
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:59,509
this one's like very basic and just in

936
00:36:57,529 --> 00:37:01,670
terms of like this drops a UART show

937
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:04,430
this will drop you into a root shell and

938
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:06,109
you're done right um whereas like

939
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,519
there's some things where you drop into

940
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:11,808
a shell and you'll have to get the

941
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,788
whatever the devices are start rebooting

942
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:15,470
and then you kill the boot process or

943
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:18,829
you like interrupt the boot process

944
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:22,970
somehow by their you know shorting out

945
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:26,359
some pins or or you know spamming

946
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:28,249
control C or control Z which is very

947
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:30,859
common like those things will literally

948
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:33,109
drop you Nichelle's as well um so like

949
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:35,598
IOT hacking pretty much applies to car

950
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:37,460
hacking and itself just to get like

951
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,369
initial access onto the radio system and

952
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,529
then to later like enumerate all the

953
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:44,420
different processes all the different

954
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:46,700
files that are on that system and to go

955
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,220
back and pretty much be able to exploit

956
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:52,308
those things remotely right so like this

957
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,779
isn't gonna be a big bounty value cuz

958
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:56,269
like if you drop a hardware hacking like

959
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:58,759
you drop a UART shell onto a radio

960
00:37:56,269 --> 00:38:00,258
system anyone's just gonna be like okay

961
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:03,049
well you need physical access to do that

962
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:05,960
but it for an example attacker is going

963
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:08,060
to buy this radio system take it home

964
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,910
dropping UART she'll take all of those

965
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,590
files and then make exploits for all of

966
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,210
the you know custom applications running

967
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,860
on this they're going to enumerate

968
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,110
services they're going to see if this

969
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,550
communicates with GSM at all um they're

970
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:22,040
gonna see if this firmware is vulnerable

971
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:24,230
there's there's just a tons of things

972
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,830
you can do once you get this but this

973
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:29,150
itself is not worth any value right in

974
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:31,580
terms of like monetary value if you

975
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:35,030
submitted this as a bone that's great it

976
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:36,470
helps the you know it helps the like it

977
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:38,120
helps the automotive manufacturer

978
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:41,240
identify their process in terms of uh

979
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,390
you know like shipping these things out

980
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,830
and not like fusing these specific like

981
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:49,940
these specific like you are ports or

982
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:52,009
serial ports or anything so still

983
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,720
reporting these are great for people to

984
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:56,000
know and like you at least get credit

985
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,140
for it um and then you get a little bit

986
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,060
of satisfaction knowing that you can

987
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,440
still do this and you could pretty much

988
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,290
take this at a numerate everything else

989
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,050
right um so other things I've seen

990
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:10,310
people do is like remove flash I've seen

991
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:11,480
people like reprogram flash oh my god um

992
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,370
some people are crazy

993
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,480
like they will literally take some of

994
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,540
the chips off and they just start

995
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:22,460
reading directly off of them I'm very

996
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:24,529
cool very interesting I've been part of

997
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,810
a process once where we did that and we

998
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:29,540
brick something I've also seen the

999
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,980
process of somebody just literally

1000
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,870
touching like putting a piece of metal

1001
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,490
between two pins like a coin and it

1002
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:39,200
dropped them into a show like

1003
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:40,970
mind-blowing stuff so those are some of

1004
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,520
the ways to get like initial access and

1005
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,930
then once again after that it's like

1006
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,750
even if you go through all of these

1007
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:49,190
processes of trying to get initial

1008
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,720
access on the system the thing that's

1009
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,880
gonna matter most to automotive

1010
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,069
developers or automotive manufacturers

1011
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,260
is they're gonna want to see you do it

1012
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:59,150
remotely right like they're gonna want

1013
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,250
to see you affect more than one vehicle

1014
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,980
they're going to like these things are

1015
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,900
gonna only start increasing as time goes

1016
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,680
on and then once we start implementing

1017
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,530
you know vehicle to vehicle

1018
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,299
communication or vehicle to emergency

1019
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,740
vehicle communication they're gonna want

1020
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,820
to see people start hacking that stuff

1021
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,919
right like they're gonna want to see

1022
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,380
multiple vehicles get hacked or they're

1023
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,480
gonna want to see um an exploit that's

1024
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,369
able to

1025
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,460
stop these types of communications right

1026
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:25,990
because I think it's BTE

1027
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,060
so vehicle to like emergency vehicle

1028
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:30,759
communication if that gets cut off then

1029
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:33,250
there's an issue right um like somebody

1030
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,830
could potentially die which is something

1031
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,180
a lot of people would be worried about

1032
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:39,100
so just keeping that stuff in mind is

1033
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,950
always good and then seeing like where

1034
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,210
the future is headed um there's gonna be

1035
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,080
a lot more of just like doing stuff

1036
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,420
remotely

1037
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:50,540
or like versus like doing stuff locally

1038
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,070
on a car because if you could affect

1039
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,300
more than one vehicle that's really

1040
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,840
important if you could track people

1041
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,950
remotely that's really important um a

1042
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,860
lot of car companies definitely do not

1043
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,629
want that um whereas like you know if

1044
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,520
you can pull out a radio system and

1045
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,070
Hacket once again like that's not

1046
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,990
something I valuable to them but once

1047
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:11,300
again good a numeration step really

1048
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:13,009
would suggest it very easy to do very

1049
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,970
easy to learn as well there's a lot more

1050
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:18,380
advanced stuff you can do with it as

1051
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:20,330
well um quick shout outs so uh these are

1052
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,030
all my friends that I work with um I

1053
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:24,440
love all of them some of the people in

1054
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,550
the flood crowd group actually pretty

1055
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,440
much everyone in the flood card group

1056
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,990
very great community to talk with I've

1057
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,550
learned so much from this community they

1058
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,470
have given so much to me

1059
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,910
in terms of knowledge and like resources

1060
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,200
that I can use that I will probably

1061
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:39,680
never be able to repay them

1062
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:42,350
so I'm doing a shout out for them once

1063
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,419
again I like if not pipe does radio

1064
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:46,670
frequencies are are F star F hacking

1065
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,470
stuff and he pretty much can tell you

1066
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,080
how to get a ham radio license shell

1067
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,149
does red team pen testing stuff that Dan

1068
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,520
does a ton of awesome research stuff

1069
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:58,190
netsuke does a ton of reverse

1070
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,870
engineering stuff same with our tu and

1071
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,610
buses can fly buses can fly it does car

1072
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,690
acting stuff or to you does car acting

1073
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,300
so there's a ton of people out there

1074
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,740
that you communicate with and they're

1075
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,580
like more than willing to help and talk

1076
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:12,620
to you Leonard and minty also people

1077
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,259
mentioned in his slides they created

1078
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:18,380
hardware they create you know a bunch of

1079
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,300
different exploits for cars to emaan

1080
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,870
jacket is just uh one up like a personal

1081
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:26,090
friend um he he pretty much got me the

1082
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:28,549
contact with like a person who owned a

1083
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:30,440
Tesla and I was able to hack it so um

1084
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,690
and I'm like still meeting up with this

1085
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,600
person trying to hack their car pretty

1086
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:37,610
much the great times um pretty much

1087
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,520
everything else locally SAE if you were

1088
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:41,420
in college I highly recommend you sign

1089
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,370
up for SAE

1090
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,290
pretty much they teach you how to hack

1091
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:47,569
in the cars uh and they allow people

1092
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:49,670
from I think around the world to pretty

1093
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:51,170
much they like pay for your flight or

1094
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,670
you could like I think it's like a

1095
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:55,010
scholarship system so you sign up for a

1096
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,680
scholarship you fly out to Michigan a

1097
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,710
bunch of car automotive manufacturers

1098
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,210
come out and they

1099
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,890
let you hack cars they teach you out of

1100
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,869
hack cars they have trainings the

1101
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:05,580
knowledge I I've only been car acting

1102
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:09,480
for one year but the amount of knowledge

1103
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:11,130
that I gained from SAE is just amazing

1104
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,560
the gentleman that actually taught me

1105
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,440
below is this picture here

1106
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,750
that's Decker he actually was on a

1107
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,359
History Channel series called the forged

1108
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:24,000
with fire um like where he made like old

1109
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,470
medieval weapons which is really cool um

1110
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,859
and then obviously like shouts of

1111
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,359
bugcrowd

1112
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:32,700
I could not have gotten into car hacking

1113
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:35,040
as much as I did without them pretty

1114
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:37,379
much accepting my random reach out of

1115
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,630
hey I wanna hack cars I want to try a

1116
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:42,210
bug bounty and hack cars will you let me

1117
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:44,070
try and then I found something and lo

1118

Def Con group um you know I present car

1124
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:01,080
hacking stuff there I'm you know trying

1125
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,839
to present more trying to reach out more

1126
