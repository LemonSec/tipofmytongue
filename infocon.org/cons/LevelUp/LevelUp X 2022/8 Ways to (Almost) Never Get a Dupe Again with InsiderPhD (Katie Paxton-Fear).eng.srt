1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,120
hello everyone my name is Katie also

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,380
known as Insider PhD welcome to level up

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,840
this is a talk on eight ways to never

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,960
get a dupe again and really it's eight

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,240
ways to almost never get a dupe again

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
dupes are gonna happen when we do bug

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,859
bounty hunting like they're just kind of

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,960
a fact of life like sometimes we're just

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,300
not quick enough but sometimes you're

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,160
actually hunting in a way which like

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,500
encourages duplicates and that's really

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,579
what I'm going to be talking about today

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,320
how to change your bug hunting

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,200
methodology to kind of get out of like

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,120
that finding duplicates or not really

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,460
finding anything and moving to you know

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,440
actually finding bugs getting paid for

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,940
them

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,360
so first of all is dupe suck

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,180
like they just are a sucky experience

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,100
that that it kind of doesn't feel good

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,079
but actually quite a lot of hackers

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,879
especially the top hackers very rarely

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,399
get duplicates and there are people who

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,100
genuinely you know can go to

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,960
um life hacking events and not find a

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,000
duplicate and find complete unique bugs

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,520
and this is really what inspired this

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,439
talk it's from my experience in Vegas

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,020
this year of going to live hacking

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,000
events and being one of those people who

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,159
didn't get a dupe who did just find

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,900
unique bugs

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,820
now sometimes people are just really

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,280
fast like sometimes people are just on

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,619
it they get an invite they start hacking

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,659
they submit things you know five minutes

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,240
after they've gotten an invite but often

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,500
there's actually a difference in the

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,299
methodology and the type of bugs they

41
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,180
look for which is actually causing this

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,979
and is why they don't get as many

43
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,840
duplicates so I'm really gonna share

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,000
kind of my tips on how I avoid that

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,220
getting duplicates so you can change

46
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,439
your methodology to avoid it but the

47
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,000
thing I want to make clear first of all

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,979
is that dupes really aren't a big deal

49
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,740
in bug grounded hunting dupes are really

50
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,259
just a factor of life like it's the risk

51
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,840
we take thankfully in bug hunting all we

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,700
waste is our time and we don't have to

53
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,439
spend money

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,780
but they do suck like they just don't

55
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,700
feel very good and this talk is

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,200
specifically for people who are getting

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,598
more dupes than actual paying bugs and

58
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,760
findings or if you're not finding

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
anything not even dupes or if you submit

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,400
something and then you get like n a

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,260
so this is ready eight tips from me on

62
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,660
how I avoid duplicates now before I tell

63
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,340
you how to avoid duplicates I've got to

64
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,020
tell you how to get a lot of duplicates

65
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,300
and I would say these are the four ways

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,920
that people get a lot of duplicates in

67
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,739
bug Bounty the first is just doing recon

68
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,440
and nothing else Recon is great for

69
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,900
learning about your target it's super

70
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,319
helpful in finding assets but if you're

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,060
just scanning your Target and just

72
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,280
reporting like sub domains without

73
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,379
necessarily doing any additional

74
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,660
Research into if they might be

75
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,040
vulnerable to something what they're

76
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,959
actually vulnerable to kind of everyone

77
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,760
is doing that everyone is kind of

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,379
getting these Recon scripts together

79
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,379
they might be subscribed to

80
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,819
um things like security trails and

81
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,400
getting this data in and you're

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,500
basically racing against the clock who

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,319
gets there first and people who make a

84
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,599
lot of money on just doing recon they

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,760
already have infrastructure set up this

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,980
isn't just them having like a single bot

87
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,560
this is them having multiple servers

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,680
multiple scanners as a way of processing

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,379
reports in such a way that's really as

90
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,879
soon as something goes live they can

91
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,800
instantly report it

92
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,680
the second is by using nuclear or other

93
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,260
Von scanners now most bug Bounty

94
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,940
programs are already hardened targets

95
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,980
not necessarily always sometimes you do

96
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,379
get code that's just been released that

97
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,500
does have low hanging bugs however on

98
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,560
the off chance a bug was left in by the

99
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,420
time there's like a template added to

100
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,420
nuclei somebody else has already found

101
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,540
it and again it's more about speed and

102
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,220
less about the kind of bugs that you

103
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,860
find right so the one way this can avoid

104
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,540
getting dupes is if you take you know

105
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,580
the results and actually do the research

106
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,860
dig in find out why it's coming up as a

107
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,260
positive and you know show an impactful

108
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,680
POC but again you're limited there by

109
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,200
your speed and that's the issue with

110
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,120
using something like nucleate it's a

111
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,159
race against the clock there are people

112
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,620
who have got Bots that will do

113
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,440
everything from get invite scan those

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,779
with nuclear report everything and then

115
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,400
move on to the next

116
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,340
client super spammy yeah but again if

117
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,740
you're only using nuclei this is the

118
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,020
issue you're going to have

119
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,120
and this kind of goes into my next point

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,639
which is being slow if you do have a

121
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,580
really automated tool based approach you

122
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,440
really need the infrastructure behind it

123
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,080
uh people who do really well at this

124
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,820
approach and don't get duplicates have

125
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,639
got customer alerts they use slack or

126
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,160
Discord and react immediately they might

127
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
have Bots that even write the report

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,080
like the people who have these kind of

129
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,720
really highly automated flows have a lot

130
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,400
of infrastructure behind them and that

131
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,080
does cost them a quite a bit of money as

132
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,400
well

133
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,500
and the final thing is following bug

134
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,020
Bounty tips only Twitter is really

135
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,000
really helpful it's great for networking

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,620
it's great for connecting with hackers

137
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,440
but if you follow like bug Bounty tips

138
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,860
everyone is using the same tips by the

139
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,720
time somebody tweets about one of their

140
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,240
tips they've already been using it for

141
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,699
days weeks or sometimes even like months

142
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,860
so you're getting information that's

143
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,620
probably reported like two months ago

144
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,720
and has just been marked as resolved

145
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,060
you're not necessarily getting the tips

146
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,460
that are going to be helpful like right

147
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,259
now you're getting the tips that were

148
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,720
helpful for this one person and that

149
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,520
doesn't mean don't ever try these like

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,960
they've totally a place for things like

151
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,460
bug Bounty tips especially if you're

152
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,820
still learning but if your current girl

153
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,560
kind of move away from getting a lot of

154
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,479
duplicates getting a lot of paid bugs

155
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,560
instead like being able to um and if

156
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,960
avoid this is really really helpful

157
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,660
now the tips I'm going to give you to in

158
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,000
this talk is really boils down to like

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,740
wanted piece of advice which is be

160
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,080
different because that's fundamentally

161
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,360
what we need to be if we want to have

162
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,139
these kind of Highly automated

163
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,160
approaches if you want to use new kids

164
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,720
one use phone scanners we want to use

165
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Recon it's build automation like that

166
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,340
the advice to avoid do because that is

167
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,539
build automation build quick

168
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,759
infrastructure make sure your data

169
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,720
centers are in the same location as your

170
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,199
target to be even faster it's about

171
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,400
speed

172
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,160
but there's another approach and this is

173
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,560
my Approach my Approach is be different

174
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,319
like my Approach is to look in places

175
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,780
that other people are look in ways that

176
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,699
other people aren't so what I'm really

177
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,620
giving you is kind of a slice of my

178
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,620
methodology and how I avoid duplicates

179
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,600
but you might be thinking all of this

180
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,979
okay be different it's really good

181
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,620
advice but how how do we actually be

182
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,940
different so tip number one look in

183
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,680
weird places and when I say weird places

184
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,960
I mean hamburger menus

185
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,479
so let's have a look at twitter.com so

186
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,160
Twitter has a bunch of common

187
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
functionality right if you think about

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,699
Twitter you might think you know post a

189
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,340
tweet reply to a tweet delete a tweet

190
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,639
you might think of following people

191
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,460
retweeting maybe adding something to

192
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,280
bookmarks maybe sending a DM editing

193
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,340
your Twitter profile and that's all like

194
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,560
the core functionality of Twitter

195
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,319
yes absolutely you should test that but

196
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,660
the high chances are that's already kind

197
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,000
of been tested and probably been tested

198
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,099
a lot instead we can look in weird

199
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,160
places so things like

200
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,620
um Twitter for marketing so on Twitter

201
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,280
you can run advert campaigns you can you

202
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,139
know have ads shown to people and

203
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,520
there's a whole bunch of settings around

204
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,220
things like ad spend and AD campaigns

205
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,660
and it's like a tweets you want to run

206
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,479
and who you want to Market to that can

207
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,819
still be an impactful place but it's not

208
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,080
necessarily something you instantly

209
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,220
think of

210
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,080
a similar thing is things like Twitter

211
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,940
communities

212
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,220
um things like Twitter circles where you

213
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,139
kind of having these like exclusive

214
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,300
places on Twitter that people can tweet

215
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,819
that might be vulnerable if they are

216
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,819
vulnerable to attack things like um you

217
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,639
know sharing private information uh some

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,800
other things are things like the careers

219
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,139
pages and applying for jobs or Twitter

220
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,740
for developers and creating apps you

221
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,979
have lists topics moments Twitter

222
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,620
circles newsletters Twitter for

223
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,799
professionals Twitter ads analytics the

224
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,020
setting and privacy things right The

225
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,299
Help Center all of these can actually

226
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,159
still be sources of bugs and often are

227
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
still in scope

228
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,540
but have like this much wider

229
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,459
functionality which is really helpful

230
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,980
you know for not finding duplicates yeah

231
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,540
everyone who tests Twitter is going to

232
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,519
look at posting a tweet but is anyone

233
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,920
going to dig into you know is there an

234
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,620
SQL injection or cross-site scripting if

235
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,959
you make an app in this particular way

236
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,399
like if you say you make your own

237
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,959
Twitter bot can you cause an SQL

238
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,620
injection or an xss attack right like

239
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,120
people aren't necessarily going into

240
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,980
that level of detail

241
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,620
so the kind of the weird places

242
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,200
um hamburger menu so any menu that you

243
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,580
don't think someone will click on go

244
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,180
into it go through all the functionality

245
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,820
uh third-party Integrations third-party

246
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,740
API Integrations

247
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,320
you know a lot of like business tools

248
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,080
integrate into things like Slack

249
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,959
test that integration you know could you

250
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,600
send a payload via slack and will that

251
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,640
actually fire on your target I actually

252
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,800
found something like this it was an ssrf

253
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,100
of you know it was in the integration

254
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,640
with another uh tool that then fired

255
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,060
uh plugins so for uh things like cms's

256
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:00,180
uh WordPress Joomla V bulletin PHP BB

257
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,820
forums all of those will have like

258
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,040
Standalone plugins that might do things

259
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,980
like keywords might do things like allow

260
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,740
people to play games might be adding

261
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,080
functionality like a chat room always

262
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,320
test plugins if something doesn't look

263
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,839
um like it belongs definitely dig into

264
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,279
the plugins and don't just report that

265
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,560
plugin is there report vulnerabilities

266
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,800
with it power user function so a lot of

267
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,440
you know people who use these tools

268
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,600
every day will have functionalities and

269
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,700
way of working around the limitations of

270
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,320
a piece of software that actually might

271
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,880
end up being a security bug on its own

272
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
so look at discussions people are having

273
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,660
look up forums look at stack Overflow

274
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,040
look at Reddit

275
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,899
and see what those lesser used

276
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,760
functionalities are

277
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,279
browser add-ons mobile apps anything

278
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,860
like that is just always full especially

279
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,720
browser add-ons no one really looks at

280
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,940
that but it can be a great place to find

281
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,579
injection points for things like

282
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,220
cross-site scripting or SQL injection

283
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,800
that might then fire on the main app oh

284
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,399
Isis RF as well customization options so

285
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,800
things like Tumblr

286
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,839
um Squarespace

287
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,940
will have these like customization

288
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,860
options that you can edit you can change

289
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,420
the background color you can add images

290
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,519
you can you know change the link color

291
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,220
that opens up so many more points that

292
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,380
are actually reflected on the page that

293
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,060
can be again huge for things like

294
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,980
cross-site scripting

295
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,220
image upload image manipulation so a lot

296
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,839
of people will go on a site like Reddit

297
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,579
and paste in their own link they'll

298
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,980
upload it to like imga but actually

299
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,779
Reddit has their own image upload

300
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,220
functionality so that can be a really

301
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,040
great place to find

302
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
um you know your standard like image Pro

303
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,959
things like image tragic

304
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,640
and especially if it's an image upload

305
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,860
people don't really know about

306
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,899
um you know people might try an avatar

307
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,360
image upload but are they going to chat

308
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,240
say try out I don't know a background

309
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,380
image upload for a customization or

310
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,260
something like that right

311
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,820
Community features can be great so

312
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,019
forums blogs support some of these might

313
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,220
be third party and we'll talk about

314
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,600
those in a minute but these can be

315
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,700
really great places that people aren't

316
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,500
necessarily looking in and even if you

317
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,700
don't necessarily hack the community

318
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,620
feature like the Forum it can be really

319
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,180
great for finding more weird

320
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,060
functionalities my favorite like place

321
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,700
to look for things is Google so on

322
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,220
Google I will look at my target as like

323
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,860
best hidden features of my target best

324
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,459
Integrations API developers tools

325
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,760
add-ons and I'll add the year advice for

326
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,760

they can be great for giving you like oh

331

by the way there's this whole analytics

332
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,079
platform that you maybe you didn't even

333
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,120
know about that actually you could um

334
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,399
you could be hacking on

335
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,360
um to any kind of updates RSS news like

336
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,220
what new functionality has just been

337
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,980
released that you can have a look at

338
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,839
um one of the great ways is like looking

339
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,180
at like configuration for those so I use

340
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,019
an example I was testing a version of

341
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,380
this app that was like essentially it

342
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,839
was like a Beta release so I couldn't

343
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,180
necessarily tell what was new in the

344
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,920
beta version that I had and what had

345
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,920
already been released so what I did is I

346
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,260
went and I was like Googling all the

347
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,339
little individual pieces of

348
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:36,899
functionality that I found to figure out

349
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,480
okay is this unique is it worth me

350
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,680
trying this or is this something that's

351
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,620
been in the app for ages again it's just

352
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,839
Googling and trying to understand the

353
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,160
app

354
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,620
and weird places doesn't mean the impact

355
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,940
isn't the same uh things like tweetdeck

356
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,279
on Twitter for example so you might

357
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,440
think as like I can't take over via like

358
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,480
account info right let's say you could

359
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,519
change anyone's email address super and

360
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,220
factful you can tweet as anybody you

361
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,480
could take over a verified account

362
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,180
whatever

363
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,620
high impact

364
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,839
now tweetdeck has this feature called

365
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,480
tweet deck for teams and essentially you

366
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,820
can invite people to tweet from an

367
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,339
account using tweetdeck teams now if you

368
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,560
could force somebody

369
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,000
to be added onto like your team and you

370
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,740
could tweet as them that could have a

371
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,380
similar impact to an account Takeover in

372
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,579
like being able to post tweets with

373
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,740
somebody else but

374
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,420
it's completely it's completely new

375
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,600
right like that isn't necessarily

376
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,820
um going to be like a duplicate with a

377
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,500
regular account takeover this is like a

378
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,060
completely new bug it's a completely new

379
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,920
way of doing things

380
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,380
now often when you kind of do this you

381
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,660
might come across the fact that a lot of

382
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,660
this is actually third party

383
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,519
um so they may only not pay out this

384
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,079
depends a lot on the client because some

385
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,060
clients absolutely will pay out because

386
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,120
they will fix it themselves

387
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
they have the money they have the

388
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,300
experience they have the developers to

389
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,880
actually fix issues with a third party

390
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,699
however a lot of people won't and they

391
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,279
will essentially send it over to the

392
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,199
third party and ask them to fix it as

393
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,360
like a customer

394
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,040
but they weren't reward a bounty because

395
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,720
again they don't intend to fix it

396
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,000
themselves so my recommendation for this

397
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,100
is to learn the common functionalities

398
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,959
you see this a lot in

399
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:28,680
um

400
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,920
forums if you see discourse if you see

401
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,820
zendesk freshdesk intercom

402
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,040
Greenhouse all of these are like

403
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,500
owned by third-party companies that just

404
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,360
tend to be branded and when you see

405
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,300
these a lot you'll kind of see the same

406
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,399
kind of systems across many different

407
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,459
clients so you end up kind of knowing a

408
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,320
lot more about it you can scroll down to

409
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,699
the bottom and often it'll have like a

410
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,980
powered by but actually you can pay to

411
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,899
get these removed sometimes and a lot of

412
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,100
companies will do that because it looks

413
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,560
a little bit less professional so you

414
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,480
really have to kind of recognize the

415
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,220
software

416
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,920
um kind of as you see it if you don't

417
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,380
necessarily recognize it I honestly get

418
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,240
like a bug hunting friend and be like do

419
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
you recognize this kind of forum

420
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,959
software and if they've seen it before

421
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,540
it might be a third party however some

422
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,779
things like things like the bulletin

423
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,480
um or that that like they pay for and

424
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,940
then they set up as their forums they've

425
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,380
got the codes they can actually make

426
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,579
fixes it really does depend on

427
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,339
um kind of the target itself and

428
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,740
especially what's in scope so the

429
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,079
fundamental thing is really can they fix

430
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,940
it if it's something that the client can

431
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,959
fix like updating to a certain version

432
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,339
report it if it's not something that

433
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,360
they can fix it's actually hosted on

434
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,680
greenhouse.io and it's just a sub domain

435
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,560
they probably can't fix that not worth

436
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,180
reporting

437
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,880
tip two develop expertise and this is

438
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,040
really the secret of the pros so the

439
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,500
advantage that Pros have is that once a

440
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,240
platform like bug crowd knows what

441
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,099
you're good at they'll send you relevant

442
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,099
invites so I do API testing I get API

443
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,439
invites and this kind of means that

444
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
every invite I get is is not necessarily

445
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,939
tailored made towards me but it's

446
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,500
something that I can get started on

447
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,059
really easily

448
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,540
now if you have these um kind of skills

449
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,819
you can actually just tell things like

450
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,860
bug crowd that you have them things like

451
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,919
certifications you can add resume skills

452
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,299
and interests you can connect different

453
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,039
accounts

454
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,679
um primarily what it will do is based on

455
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,400
the bugs that you've reported so being

456
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,260
active on the platform reporting bugs

457
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,760
that will get you better invites

458
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,860
essentially once they know the kind of

459
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,900
bugs that you find and that you get paid

460
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,840
for they will give you more invite which

461
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,940
means that you get fresher invites with

462
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,100
less competition there should be more

463
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,660
bugs there and there's less people to

464
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,700
compete against smaller cohort of

465
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,039
researchers things like a bug bash less

466
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,580
opportunity for everyone to find the

467
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,980
same bug but

468
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,460
but that doesn't mean the the it's low

469
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,220
like it's zero right it means there's

470
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,200
less likely that you find a duplicate

471
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,419
because you've got to remember that when

472
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,240
you get a fresh invite like this the

473
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,679
other people who also have an invite

474
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,100
have the same kind of skill set so

475
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,039
you've really got to like dig into the

476
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,100
data and see so common expertisers that

477
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,059
we see mobile applications iOS Android

478
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,220
mobile application is really common a

479
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,840
binary so that's like desktop

480
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,260
application super rare skill set

481
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,660
um really good to get into especially if

482
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,179
you want to look at like binaries that

483
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,660
are powered by like webview engines I

484
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,000
think about things like Discord that

485
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,700
essentially use JavaScript but are kind

486
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,520
of binaries a code review

487
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,380
um any kind of code review doesn't

488
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,179
matter what language is that is really

489
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,059
helpful Cloud now I think if I was

490
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,059
learning anything I'd go for cloud

491
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:12,480
AWS Azure Google Cloud platform all of

492
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,600
these are really unique expertises that

493
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,460
a lot of people don't have people like

494
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,100
me who have API API is actually fairly

495
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,380
common which is why I kind of pivoted

496
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,760
myself into more doing mobile

497
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,700
applications like mobile apis and they

498
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,520
do differ from desktop apis as well

499
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,460
things like Automotive iot Hardware

500
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,500
they're a bit more specialized but if

501
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,539
you have the ability to gain that

502
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,179
experience you will get so many more

503
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,280
interesting invites that are with

504
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,140
smaller cohorts any kind of

505
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,520
certifications you have if you've done

506
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,419
pen testing before then absolutely uh

507
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,220
you should tell people you've done pen

508
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,840
testing and make that you know a skill

509
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,580
you talk about because that might get

510
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,799
you on to things like next Generation

511
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,620
pen tests that bug crowd offer but this

512
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,660
bug crowd isn't the only platform that

513
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,220
kind of wants you see certification

514
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,919
certification can be really helpful

515
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,600
now if you look at the data so this

516
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,260
comes from the bug crowd Inside the Mind

517
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,059
of a hacker report

518
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,360
70 of uh

519
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,240
bug crowds kind of

520
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,360
like total pool nose web application

521
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,620
testing

522
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,480
so if you want to look at the kind of

523
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,520
hit this is the data as it's presented

524
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,340
in the report this is the data that I

525
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,520
have then put into a graph for us

526
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,039
because then you can sort of see the

527
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,700
difference right so 70 of everyone on

528
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,320
bug crowd knows how to do web app

529
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,020
testing so there's 30 that don't know

530
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,900
web app testing essentially now the

531
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,220
seven percent of their Network pen

532
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,740
testing but this is like not a

533
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,020
percentage of that this is like seven

534
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,760
percent and some of them might also know

535
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,400
web out testing if that makes sense so

536
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,799
we see the jump right between web app

537
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,160
pen testing and the next like skill

538
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,580
is huge it's like a older magnet like

539
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,679
it's 10 10 times as many people know web

540
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,900
app testing and when we look down here

541
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,520
iot Hardware like one percent binary

542
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,020
reverse engineering is one iOS is two

543
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,740
percent API is two percent code review

544
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,440
is two percent even recon at this point

545
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,740
was three percent so actually if you do

546
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,140
gain these skills you're already looking

547
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,840
in like one percent of the total bug

548
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,580
crowd population so if you think about

549
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,299
you know there's a thousand hackers who

550
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,520
have like a certain skill that might be

551
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,260
invited

552
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,260
actually you know 70 of them are going

553
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,720
to know where about testing but only one

554
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,159
percent of them is going to have like

555
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,860
binary or reverse engineering skills

556
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,440
so being able to get yourself out of

557
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,480
this web app Bubble into all these other

558
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,720
ones is huge and often the skills aren't

559
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,120
necessarily that much different like

560
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,980
they're not completely new skills you

561
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,900
can just learn them

562
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,380
so what aren't the pros doing so this is

563
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,559
I think a really helpful graph that is

564
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,360
kind of not really explained very well

565
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,100
in the report

566
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,159
um because like it's hard to read so

567
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,559
this is how I've chosen to to represent

568
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,860
the same data so the dark blue here is

569
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,360
like noobs so noobs here 70 of noobs say

570
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,659
they know web Ted testing uh regulars I

571
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:37,980
think as people who have found a bug

572
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,539
before

573
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,539
um are like up here and 80 and then

574
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,880
Elite so these are the top hackers you

575
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,059
know any very small portion of them uh

576
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,820
say like mainly web and you can see here

577
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,520
that actually beginners do try things

578
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,480
like iot Hardware are mobile or looking

579
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,159
at apis

580
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,500
but again the difference between this

581
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,620
and this right is huge so if you find a

582
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,100
few bugs and you'll say specializing

583
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,640
mobile there is less than 10 of regulars

584
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,860
that are doing at mobile and even less

585
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,500
when it comes to the elite right and if

586
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,299
we kind of break this down into some pie

587
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:22,380
charts of the elite hackers we've got a

588
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,720
huge amount of them all doing web right

589
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,760
and even regular is a huge amount of

590
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,679
doing web some of them are picking up

591
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,400
you know iot and Hardware but again it's

592
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,580
very small slices of this pie there are

593
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,500
opportunities if you're in the noob

594
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,440
group to specialize in these areas and

595
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,720
get into these areas of the pie chart

596
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,580
right the ones where you're barely

597
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,200
competing because everyone else is

598
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,580
focused on web

599
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,820
so how do you develop this expertise at

600
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,539
time

601
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,179
essentially this is kind of how I'd

602
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,460
recommend I've kind of done this in like

603
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,520
a linear like line because my slides are

604
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,039
landscape not because this is a process

605
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,960
that goes from step one to step two to

606
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,419
step three this is you're constantly

607
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,299
learning if you don't think I get like

608
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,900
books on API hacking you are completely

609
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,299
mistaken because I I read books and API

610
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,520
hacking but if you don't know where to

611
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,380
start number one easiest place to start

612
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,539
is a textbook textbooks are designed for

613
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:22,799
people who have no idea what they're

614
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,140
doing and importantly they give you the

615
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,960
vocab to do more research so

616
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,760
if you've just started saying mobile

617
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,220
hacking you may not know the differences

618
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,480
between like Android and Linux but by

619
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,460
reading a textbook they'll walk you

620
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,799
through it and that will give you the

621
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,860
vocab to be able to say oh okay they are

622
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,679
completely different things or like Java

623
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:47,880
and

624
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,039
um like Android apps Android apps are

625
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,480
written in Java but they're kind of

626
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,100
different things

627
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,080
they are really beginner friendly so if

628
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,340
you don't know where to start and you

629
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,600
want to learn something new start the

630
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,580
textbook 100 if I was learning something

631
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,260
new I always start with a textbook

632
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,440
step two is YouTube videos so I actually

633
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,240
wouldn't recommend starting immediately

634
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,000
with YouTube videos because although

635
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,320
they're beginner friendly they have a

636
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,460
playlist take you through the material

637
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,500
they kind of rely on you knowing the

638
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,080
vocab or you being okay with picking up

639
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,059
the vocab as you go I'm different people

640
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,220
like feel different like levels of

641
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,500
comfort with that

642
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,200
conference talks so conference talks are

643
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,000
designed for a specialist audience but

644
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,919
it doesn't assume expertise so what I

645
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,900
mean by that is if you go and listen to

646
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,080
like a Defcon talk you they like they

647
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,480
expect you to know what cyber security

648
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,880
is they don't necessarily expect you to

649
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,460
know in depth the specific area of cyber

650
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,260
security they're talking about they

651
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,080
assume specialism not expertise and

652
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,640
quite often they are marketing their

653
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,679
Works they do picture at a lower level

654
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,480
to get people interested in what they've

655
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,100
done

656
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,640
um articles and white papers so they're

657
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,919
slightly different to blogs

658
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,720
um so I've kind of put them together

659
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,820
here because blogs can really be for

660
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,919
very different audiences when I say

661
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,840
articles and white papers I'm kind of

662
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,140
referring to things like rfcs for

663
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,520
example

664
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,500
um they're kind of Highly specific to a

665
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,039
certain topic but they are kind of

666
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,419
designed for these different audiences

667
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,360
often again designed for specialism not

668
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,419
necessarily expertise but require not

669
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,700
just a knowledge of like the vocabulary

670
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,400
to actually follow these but maybe some

671
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,440
additional like information that you may

672
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,760
not have

673
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,740
now these are probably some of the

674
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,320
hardest things to actually read so

675
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,179
really when I put these next to you

676
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,520
should kind of be like going through

677
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,159
them by the time you get to this

678
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,039
um so CTF practice Labs if you are a

679
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,260
Hands-On learner getting experience in

680
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,600
an actual environment can be huge for

681
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,580
understanding something what I really

682
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,440
like to do is I like to make my own Labs

683
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,020
so my background is software engineering

684
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,059
I was like a data scientist and a

685
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,919
software engineer I know how to write

686
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,740
code I know how to write code in like an

687
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,840
Enterprise environment

688
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,940
um so I kind of understand what

689
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,440
production code looks like so when I

690
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,779
hear about a new vulnerability I use an

691
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,400
example of ssrf

692
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,400
being able to build a lab means that I

693
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,260
understand that better

694
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,820
now some people aren't necessarily

695
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,159
programmers they don't want to do Labs

696
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,760
um like I do but they can really range

697
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,220
in difficulty not every CTF is for

698
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,500
beginners we often kind of advertise

699
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,960
ETFs as beginner friendly

700
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,220
um but some of them are actually really

701
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,779
difficult and require really expert

702
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,840
knowledge and finally hacking eventually

703
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,820
you need to actually find the bugs you

704
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,880
have to actually practice so

705
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,340
what this can kind of look like is you

706
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,500
download a textbook let's say from no

707
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,720
starch press on

708
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,179
um iot hacking you watch some videos of

709
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,860
people doing it you might listen to a

710
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,059
talk

711
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,340
um or you might you know watch your CTF

712
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,320
being played you might read some

713
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,419
articles about other people find bugs

714
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,820
there you might you know get an iot

715
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,159
device and start hacking on it and you

716
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,840
kind of go back to the YouTube videos as

717
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,220
you're working like you kind of have

718
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,380
this you know backwards and forwards

719
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,539
aspect but you always learn like you're

720
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,480
always developing that expertise now if

721
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,520
you're not sure what to learn at the

722
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,460
moment I pick Cloud so cloud services

723
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,520
things like AWS

724
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,700
are so so so so so common nowadays they

725
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,779
are

726
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,240
um some of the most common ways of

727
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,900
Hosting websites they are

728
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,500
some of the most common ways of

729
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,900
um kind of storing things like private

730
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,559
uh like keys for example uh if you heard

731
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,900
recently about the Uber hack one of the

732
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,740
things I had was AWS and access to AWS

733
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,140
like got most of their hosted services

734
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,539
so definitely if you don't know what to

735
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,820
pick I'd probably pick cloud

736
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,580
now my third tip is about researching in

737
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,400
depth you should spend more time reading

738
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,679
about the bugs that you're looking for

739
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,960
than actually hunting for them and I'll

740
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,760
use an example so I was testing an app

741
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,179
recently it was an email app and

742
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,179
uh kind of like uh Gmail here

743
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,399
had like an unsubscribed link and I was

744
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,779
like hmm

745
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,360
how does that actually work though like

746
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,520
I can press the unsubscribe link I get

747
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,960
an email back saying you have been

748
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,460
unsubscribed

749
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,340
but how does that work like what what

750
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,260
makes that work

751
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,380
so I go and Google it and I say oh

752
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,240
there's this header on email called

753
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,399
emails called list unsubscribe and it

754
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,919
has this like mail to link and it also

755
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,320
has like an HTTP link like okay that's

756
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,799
interesting what else can you do

757
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,500
so I go through the rfcs for the list

758
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,799
unsubscribed email header to understand

759
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,020
what the requirements are for this email

760
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,620
header you know how does this link work

761
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,159
and I thought okay so list unsubscribed

762
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,539
mail too how does the mail two like URI

763
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,820
scheme work so I ended up looking into

764
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,880
that and I was kind of going through

765
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,659
this like ssrf at the time

766
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:19,320
um

767
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,120
this has kind of been my like summer

768
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,279
theme has been learning ssrf which is

769
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,559
why I'm talking about it so much but I'm

770
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:29,100
like okay so ssrf you know requires me

771
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,580
to get data this has like a header which

772
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,240
has this like mail to unsubscribe this

773
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,880
clicking this button is then sending an

774
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,700
email back am I sending an email so I go

775
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,200
into and check if I'm saying I am

776
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,679
sending an email okay so this is

777
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,500
clicking on this link automatically like

778
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,740
okay might be ssrf going through some

779
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,500
research in ssrf how do I test for it go

780
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,140
down the rabbit hole of an ssrf sheriff

781
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,580
and I kind of end up

782
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,240
in this Wikipedia rabbit hole right like

783
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,279
I'm I start out with this how does how

784
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,380
does this unsubscribe button appear and

785
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,380
I end up digging into you know how

786
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,419
emails work like all the headers in the

787
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,100
email because what are all the headers

788
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,380
in the email anyway right

789
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,720
so this ended up with me going down this

790
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,840
rabbit hole and I found a butt like I

791
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,559
found like three ssrfs by going into

792
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,020
this like rabbit hole and were any of

793
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,179
them related to the mail on like the

794
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:36,059
male 2 in the list unsubscribe header no

795
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,380
they weren't they were related about

796
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,020
something else completely but that idea

797
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,580
sent me down this rabbit hole which then

798
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,860
inspired more ideas I did a ton of

799
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,380
reading and a ton of research to try and

800
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,720
understand how this button was appearing

801
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,419
now the problem is if you look at things

802
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,760
like the WAFF bypass exercise that often

803
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,919
gets shared

804
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,320
you just see you know save to notion

805
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,380
links bug Bounty tips xss Academy bypass

806
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,440
but why does that work because when a

807
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,140
cami fixes this issue

808
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,380
like this particular payload are you now

809
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,659
screwed like do you can you not now

810
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,620
cause a xss because something about this

811
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,440
isn't working and I really like some Dev

812
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,880
sagwan if you don't follow me on Twitter

813
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,539
his tweets are great and he wrote this

814
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,760
really good it's like four years old but

815
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,220
it's still a really good

816
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,820
um

817
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,679
way of understanding uh WAFF bypass

818
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,279
and he created this really gray image as

819
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,039
well which like explains every part and

820
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,419
why a laugh bypass works this is so

821
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,240
so much better like it's so much more

822
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,880
helpful it's so much more in-depth and

823
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,700
you're understanding why it's not enough

824
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,880
to just copy a payload from Twitter like

825
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,279
if it doesn't work what you just give up

826
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,559
if it does work it might be a duplicate

827
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,299
or it's something they already intend to

828
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:06,600
fix for or it's like something where

829
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,820
they've already had it submitted a

830
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,360
minute earlier by understanding how

831
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,419
Exercise Works in depth you can modify

832
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,460
it yourself rather than wait for

833
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,039
somebody else do it for you you know one

834
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,080
laugh change can fix many different

835
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,320
laugh bypasses so being able to be up to

836
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,600
date on you know how laughs are working

837
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,940
you know as soon as they cut as soon as

838
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,100
it comes out because again this was not

839
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,620
posted the same day this bypass was

840
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,899
found there's no way because why would

841
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:39,240
you waste that right like bug Bounty is

842
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,279
competitive

843
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,380
now a lot of the marketing and hype

844
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,179
really frames bug Bounty as it being

845
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:46,500
easy money

846
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,179
so if the information on things like

847
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,740
payload all the things can't just be

848
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,500
copy and pasted people tend to give up

849
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,539
learning a vulnerability deeply it means

850
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,039
you're already ahead of people just

851
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,960
trying payloads you can create more

852
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,360
impactful reports and often clients

853
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,940
don't pay for an exercise they pay for

854
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,159
the impact of that exercise if you can

855
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,380
show you using an exercise to get an

856
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,960
account takeover P1 if you just proven

857
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,099
xss P3 the difference in like how much a

858
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,619
bounty can be can be thousands in those

859
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:19,500
in those two and really understanding of

860
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,359
vulnerability and taking the time to do

861
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,060
the research huge

862
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,599
now where can you research web security

863
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:29,940
rfcs I'll be honest like literally two

864
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,739
years ago I would have told you don't

865
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,619
bother reading them now I I 100

866
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:37,560
recommend reading rfcs if you're not

867
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,780
sure what a header does like you see it

868
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,000
in HTTP you see an email look it up in

869
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,520
an RFC figure out how it's supposed to

870
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,119
work and what the requirements are

871
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,820
listen to conference talks by people who

872
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,760
do uh web security portswiger have a

873
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,099
really good like web security uh

874
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:59,160
research like group within ports wigger

875
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,680
and they do things like uh cash

876
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,359
poisoning right like they're doing the

877
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,940
research there listen to the talks don't

878
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,540
read the like bug Bounty tips go to the

879
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,339
source go to that conference talk really

880
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,320
try and understand it

881
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,800
Twitter is a great source of information

882
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,780
and distraction but there are people

883
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,359
tweeting about articles they've written

884
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,099
on these re-technical subjects and again

885
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:26,160
listen to them don't just listen to say

886
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,160
me when I make a YouTube video right uh

887
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,040
Google Scholar if you're a student you

888
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,740
likely have like a ton of access to like

889
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,599
white papers that you may not even

890
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,900
realize blogs great resources but find

891
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,460
out what their sources are when they

892
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,800
write them like my videos for example

893
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,140
great places to start but

894
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm not giving you all the details

895
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,579
absolutely ask me call me out and be

896
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,740
like Katie where are your references you

897
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,200
have a PhD shouldn't you have references

898
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,320
in your videos absolutely do

899
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,240
and some of this is about note-taking as

900
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,680
well now I'm not going to go too much

901
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,540
into this because I don't think anyone

902
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,300
wants to listen to a like hour of me

903
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,640
talking about how to take notes

904
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,740
um but I'm gonna go very very quickly

905
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,040
into how you take more thoughtful notes

906
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,599
so there's two ways of kind of

907
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,180
organizing information one is kind of by

908
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,859
content what the information is about

909
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:22,680
think about that as having like science

910
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,079
inside science there is biology inside

911
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,079
biology there is plants inside plants

912
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,020
there are cell walls right like you have

913
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,540
this way of kind of hierarchically going

914
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,140
down but a better way of note-taking and

915
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,720
a better way of thinking about notes is

916
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,720
actually thinking about the context when

917
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,940
you need this again what do you need to

918
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,440
search for so use an example

919
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,359
vulnerabilities you could sort your

920
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:50,099
vulnerabilities by vulnerability type

921
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,520
you could go injection SQL injection

922
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,599
but I would suggest you say sort them by

923
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,119
vulnerability location reflected input

924
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,339
then you might want to have

925
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,859
um SQL injection you might want to have

926
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,859
xss together because when you see

927
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,380
reflected

928
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,880
input being outputted

929
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,099
you can test for everything that affects

930
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,380
that particular location

931
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,140
or alternatively sort by impact

932
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,940
different ways to take over an account

933
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,520
but again it's if you need this again

934
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,180
what you need to search for so my system

935
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,920
and it's kind of developed actually over

936
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,440
the past few years is

937
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,960
um a zettel Caster method where you have

938
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,420
these kind of trees that form naturally

939
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,400
not because you're adding hierarchy into

940
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,740
your notes but because they naturally

941
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,839
appear as you go deeper into a subject

942
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,540
so you start off by looking at file

943
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,599
uploads you go into that and say oh

944
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,720
image uploads in image uploads you go

945
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,000
into that and say I know things like

946
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,220
image tragic and then you might have

947
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,040
another one which goes into you know

948
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,260
image manipulation after they've been

949
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,599
uploaded and it kind of forms this

950
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,339
natural

951
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:06,119
um

952
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,140
tree structure that appears kind of by

953
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,060
level of detail

954
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,460
now this can be really difficult to

955
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,760
actually sort through and kind of turn

956
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,339
into something you can actually use very

957
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,859
easily you can kind of take out like a

958
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,079
topic and like write about a topic which

959
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,760
is helpful but I don't think for this

960
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,099
particular use case

961
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:31,020
instead having maps of content create

962
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,540
this like

963
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,640
contents page of your notes so in here

964
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,920
you have things like understanding

965
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,920
habits defining what a habit is how

966
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,640
habits are formed these kind of have the

967
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,000
same topic of understanding habits but

968
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,220
you kind of organize them together with

969
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,859
like other things related to habits it's

970
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:55,380
about context of your notes not the

971
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,300
content of your notes

972
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,560
um but I'm not going to go too much more

973
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,119
into that but that's how to think about

974
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,579
it like don't think I need to sort my

975
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,619
notes by type think you need to sort

976
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,420
your notes by how you're going to use

977
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,400
them in like

978
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,200
two months time when you forget the

979
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,480
content and need to look it up

980
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,859
tip four

981
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,440
don't limit your bug classes if you only

982
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,660
look for one type of bug you can be

983
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,300
staring on right in the face you can't

984
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,960
see the bug through the trees like

985
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,640
if you're looking at an app and you've

986
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,560
learned exercise and you've learned so

987
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,820
much about access you've got all these

988
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,540
bypasses you've got everything in your

989
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,180
like note system and then you have an

990
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,400
application that

991
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,680
just isn't vulnerable like it uses a

992
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,480
waft you can't bypass the WAFF there's

993
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,119
nothing on Twitter you can't find a bug

994
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,280
if you're only looking for one type of

995
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,780
bug you're screwed when you can't find

996
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,780
it and if somebody else who has already

997
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,460
come ahead of you has already looked for

998
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,540
that bug

999
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,280
then you can really struggle and I think

1000
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,320
this Show's actually on Twitter because

1001
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,260
if you look at like what top bug bounty

1002
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,900
hunters are doing like zwink here you

1003
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,180
know he's kind of got these three

1004
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,440
categories of idol exercise csrf and

1005
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,560
then you've got people replying who are

1006
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,680
like I can't find an xss I can't find a

1007
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,760
bug

1008
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,099
um I can't find an xss bug for two to

1009
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:23,339
three months but if you're just limiting

1010
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,380
yourself to xss then you're missing the

1011
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,839
idols and csrf that zwink has got right

1012
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,900
like they are effectively kind of

1013
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,060
skipping out on these and this is kind

1014
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,440
of a controversial thing to say right

1015
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,480
because a lot of people do recommend

1016
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,180
this as a place to start for beginners I

1017
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,119
really don't I think you need to be able

1018
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,980
to diversify

1019
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,800
in order to avoid getting stuck in like

1020
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,020
the duplicate Valley

1021
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,000
um if you get an invite and you can't

1022
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,740
find an exercise or an eye drawer and

1023
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,660
that's all you look for even if you're

1024
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,000
in that first cohort you have the

1025
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,339
maximum opportunity you could be staring

1026
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:00,839
another vulnerability right in the face

1027
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:03,660
you can't predict when or what you'll be

1028
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,119
invited to and this kind of goes back to

1029
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,160
my point about learning context which is

1030
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,099
learn the signs not the specifics you

1031
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:12,960
couldn't always look up payloads you can

1032
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,119
always get Intruder and run like 10

1033
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,500
different payloads

1034
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,119
so instead of sitting there like copying

1035
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,180
those payloads into save to notion

1036
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,920
instead look at the signs of bugs you

1037
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,480
see reflected input you test for

1038
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,180
exercise you see IDs you test for Idols

1039
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,000
you learn those very quick litmus tests

1040
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,660
my one is like if I'm looking for idols

1041
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,180
I will see is the website checking my

1042
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,560
access what happens if I remove the

1043
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,440
cookie what happens if I change the ID

1044
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,020
um what exactly is controlling the

1045
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,880
authentic the authorization mechanism

1046
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,160
that is it my authentication who I'm

1047
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,440
logged in as is it my role whatever

1048
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,140
learn the signs not the specifics

1049
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,119
does this go against what I just said

1050
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,700
because I said that you should learn

1051
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,060
things in depth yes and no

1052
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,760
you should definitely learn things in

1053
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,540
depth and go deep into a bug but go deep

1054
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,700
into lots of different bugs don't just

1055
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,920
learn one because you really could be

1056
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,440
literally just walking past others

1057
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,619
tip five geographic or payment Gates or

1058
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,420
even languages

1059
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,480
some functions will be locked unless you

1060
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,820
pay money like you have a free tip a

1061
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,640
light tier and then some kind of like

1062
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,760
high tier medium tier whatever

1063
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,920
um you can get a prepaid debit card that

1064
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,839
you put like just enough money for like

1065
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:38,640
one month

1066
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,160
um but that unlocks like a ton of new

1067
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,660
features that you didn't have access to

1068
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,900
before and as a tip sometimes if you've

1069
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,579
been provisioned an account you might be

1070
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,260
able to talk to support or talk to the

1071
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,380
client through support and say Hey would

1072
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,240
it be possible to get this level of

1073
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,180
account so I can do this kind of testing

1074
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,180
um getting access either via trials for

1075
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,339
like a week or having a prepaid debit

1076
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,380
card for just a month means you're not

1077
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,579
actually going to keep on buying

1078
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:08,460
something that you don't need but really

1079
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,020
really helpful for accessing

1080
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,520
functionality you didn't already have

1081
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,900
and some people just aren't testing this

1082
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,740
Geographic restrictions are really

1083
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,780
common for me in the UK

1084
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,460
um a lot of the times you have targets

1085
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,420
that are restricted to specific

1086
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,700
countries like the USA in fact I'm

1087
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,920
testing something right now which is not

1088
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,599
available in the UK so I have to use a

1089
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,200
VPN I have to like fake my location it's

1090
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,540
kind of a pain but

1091
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,280
other people have to go through the same

1092
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,099
pain unless they live in the US

1093
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:40,380
um for me I also get blocked because the

1094
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,940
websites don't want to comply with gdpr

1095
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,099
they might have different functions in

1096
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,560
other regions different pricing uh

1097
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,319
really common bug is being able to set

1098
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,420
the price like maybe the price is like

1099
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,180
five dollars or five rupees and then the

1100
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,400
conversion rate like between those two

1101
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,220
you can just change the

1102
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,740
um currency but not necessarily the

1103
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,460
price so a price stays as five currency

1104
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,420
even though the difference between five

1105
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,460
dollars and five um

1106
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,619
rupee is completely different

1107
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,599
language is another common one if you

1108
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,339
speak another language like you speak

1109
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:16,619
French work on francophone targets

1110
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:19,859
people who only speak English and if I

1111
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:21,119
don't have an English language Change

1112
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,099
option are scared of them

1113
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,160
Game Changer if you don't speak like if

1114
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,680
you speak languages look for targets

1115
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,140
that use those languages

1116
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,800
number six open source projects now this

1117
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,540
actually got me a bug at a recent live

1118
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,760
event so

1119
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,740
um open source is everywhere and when I

1120
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,540
say open source software I mean like

1121
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,180
software that people upload

1122
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,680
um that they're like hey you can use

1123
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,420
this thing I made

1124
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,700
now I really like this meme oh this

1125
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,980
image from XKCD where it's like some

1126
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,599
project a random person in Brassica has

1127
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:57,180
been thankfully maintaining since 2003

1128
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,339
which is powering all modern digital

1129
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:01,619
infrastructure you need to sort data and

1130
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,060
see there's an open source project for

1131
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,940
that maybe you need to count calculate

1132
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,099
rocket re-entry in Python there's an

1133
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:09,480
open source project for that and by the

1134
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,980
way I looked for and it took me

1135
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,460
literally three seconds to Google for

1136
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,220
open source code is everywhere and what

1137
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,040
people will do is they'll discuss

1138
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,800
security issues they'll like have issues

1139
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,359
and they'll be discussing it between

1140
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,060
them they'll be like hey by the way this

1141
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,040
is a weird configuration

1142
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,319
if you find out your target issues in a

1143
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:32,760
specific language or framework or

1144
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,680
Library you can actually find out what

1145
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,300
one versions might be vulnerable by

1146
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,579
looking at things like CVS look at the

1147
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:40,260
error messages are great by the way if

1148
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,640
you ever have an error message super

1149
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,099
helpful for figuring out like versions

1150
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:45,900
and stuff again it's something where you

1151
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,020
have to learn deeply but can be really

1152
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,700
helpful finding things that aren't bugs

1153
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,319
because you're doing more reading than

1154
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,140
hunting you're doing that research

1155
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,339
now

1156
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,440
difficult thing here is can the target

1157
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,200
fix it because it depends if it's a

1158
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,900
configuration out of date version using

1159
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,240
an insecure deprecated method

1160
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,339
something that's fixable by the client

1161
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:10,319
it should absolutely still be rewarded

1162
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,839
because they have to fix it if it's an

1163
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,660
unpatched zero day for the open source

1164
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,160
project there's not necessarily much a

1165
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,339
client can do however clients may still

1166
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:22,200
choose to go and fix that open source

1167
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,480
code because that's a risk

1168
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,700
for them if it's a complete third party

1169
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,040
there's not much a client can really do

1170
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,020
because they kind of purchase the

1171
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,079
software but for open source there might

1172
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,339
actually be a way for the client to fix

1173
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,140
it so I always recommend reporting open

1174
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,720
source issues

1175
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,760
even if it's not necessarily something

1176
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,980
the target is maintaining directly if

1177
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,800
they can do something about it

1178
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,619
um they should and they can fix it then

1179
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:52,319
they should pay our bounty

1180
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,240
tip number seven is to play for your

1181
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,640
strengths now despite everything I've

1182
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,740
told you about looking for weird bugs in

1183
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,380
weird places ignore me if you know what

1184
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,540
your strengths are if you know skills

1185
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,339
that you are really good at if you know

1186
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:07,200
ways of hunting that you're really good

1187
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,740
at play to them play to your strengths

1188
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,200
I'm looking I know my skills are an API

1189
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,359
I will look in apis a strength that I

1190
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,339
have is that I can write code I will

1191
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:21,060
often go into developer apis and like

1192
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,040
create the developer version of

1193
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,400
something and test that myself I am

1194
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,500
specifically playing to my strengths

1195
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,359
that I know not a lot of people already

1196
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,480
have because fundamentally learning is

1197
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,540
energy intensive and time consuming

1198
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,180
if you already know something if you

1199
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,680
already know you're good at it take

1200
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,640
everything I've said in this

1201
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,200
presentation and throw it in the garbage

1202
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,839
there is no point doing something that

1203
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,760
doesn't play to whatever you're already

1204
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,099
good at if you're a developer code

1205
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:51,900
reviewing python it might be a strong

1206
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,119
skill don't learn JavaScript code review

1207
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:55,740
if you don't need to and you don't want

1208
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,819
to it can be so tiring to learn those

1209
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:02,520
skills and go forward and actually

1210
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,859
there's no point you're going to be

1211
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:06,720
behind people who already know those

1212
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,260
skills and yes the competition may be a

1213
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,339
lot lower but if you're the top already

1214
00:48:13,339 --> 00:48:15,540
you do not need to be throwing yourself

1215
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,599
into the bottom of another category

1216
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,240
great great example here is if you

1217
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,300
already know an application just start

1218
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,520
hacking it if you're a long-term user if

1219
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,980
you're a power user you are a step ahead

1220
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,940
of everyone else when I hack I if I

1221
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,920
don't know an application I am sitting

1222
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,420
there trying to learn the basics of it

1223
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,300
right if you're already an already use

1224
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,099
it you're a step ahead of everyone else

1225
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:42,780
when I found my first book I found my

1226
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,560
First Book on an app I was familiar with

1227
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,819
granted I wasn't necessarily familiar

1228
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:49,619
with the functionality I was testing but

1229
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:52,800
because I knew the app I spent less time

1230
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,300
on understanding the Target and more

1231
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,880
time on hacking I was like ahead of

1232
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,040
where other people I was competing

1233
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,800
against were because I already knew it

1234
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,680
and nowadays I do tend to hack a bit

1235
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,020
more on stuff that I've never used

1236
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,400
before

1237
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,760
but I do still kind of focus on hacking

1238
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,319
things that I already know or use

1239
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:15,359
already if I get an invite for something

1240
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,460
I'm familiar with I'm gonna instantly be

1241
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,780
like okay yeah I want to hack that

1242
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,540
because I know that that's going to play

1243
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,160
to my strengths

1244
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,260
because I already know I know that app

1245
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,280
so my final piece of advice is program

1246
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,960
statistics so this is my final top tip

1247
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,420
so on bug crowd and on other platforms

1248
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,940
as well but let's just focus on by crowd

1249
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,520
um each program has statistics so some

1250
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,260
of them will have

1251
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,260
um like the disclosed bugs

1252
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,040
um like you can see here and not

1253
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,380
everything is like listed here so you

1254
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,480
can see this is atlassian's program we

1255
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,060
can see the priority we can see the

1256
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,980
target

1257
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,640
um and we can see uh when it was

1258
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,619
accepted so we can see how active the

1259
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,599
program is there but we can also see you

1260
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,079
know what are being targeted the most so

1261
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:08,579
we have like Confluence server

1262
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:12,300
Confluence crap Cloud premium jira

1263
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,579
service management server

1264
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,920
um atlassian Marketplace jira software

1265
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,619
server now this is just like a snapshot

1266
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,180
of things I took when I made these

1267
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,300
slides but if you were to like look at

1268
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,640
say the last month of activity on the

1269
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,940
program what's actually being targeted

1270
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,500
are you seeing that say the atlassian

1271
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,380
marketplace is barely tested in which

1272
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,640
case you should be looking on the

1273
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,319
atlassian marketplace and seeing if you

1274
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:39,180
can find bugs there

1275
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,420
if you see the Confluence server has a

1276
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,900
lot of p1s but not a lot of you know say

1277
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,280
p2s or p3s or p4s you might be there

1278
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,260
might be a lot of p4s in there they're

1279
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,480
just not been looked at yet there might

1280
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,640
be a lot of low hanging fruit and

1281
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,680
especially the

1282
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,800
um activity level so you can see here it

1283
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,079
was accepted on this date this

1284
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,900
verification within is also based on the

1285
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,420
client not bug crowd so this is from bug

1286
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,700
crowd triage to when the client like

1287
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,319
marks it

1288
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:13,980
um

1289
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,260
after after things have been triaged

1290
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,940
right so it goes

1291
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,020
um

1292
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,839
like so you submit you submit it triage

1293
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,900
gets to it in like two days and then

1294
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,940
five days from when triage looks at it

1295
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,099
the client then says yes this is

1296
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,559
something we know this is a duplicate

1297
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,260
this is you know whatever

1298
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,540
the other useful thing here is the

1299
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,119
vulnerabilities rewarded so this gives

1300
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,339
you an idea of how active this program

1301
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:42,599
is

1302
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,940
and you see here it's like active payout

1303
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,640
within the last X months combine this

1304
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,680
with their bug Bounty table and that can

1305
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,200
give you an idea of whether or not this

1306
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,300
is something that gets a lot of p1s or

1307
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,099
if this is something that's getting a

1308
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,119
lot more p3s

1309
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,660
um and because this is in three months

1310
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,700
this is very good way of seeing how

1311
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:07,140
active a program is as well so if a

1312
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,300
um if you've got a less active program

1313
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,640
you know this verification within is a

1314
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,040
lot higher you might be waiting a long

1315
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,079
time to find out if something is a dupe

1316
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,500
and that can sometimes not be great

1317
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,420
you can really start to make inferences

1318
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,819
is this an older or a newer program if

1319
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,680
it's older is the scope constantly

1320
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,200
updating or is it stagnant an older

1321
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,140
problem program plus stagnant scope can

1322
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,579
really mean there's a lot of duplicates

1323
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:35,400
a lengthy acceptance time so this is

1324
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,740
again from bug crowd triaging it to the

1325
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,200
client receiving it lots of bugs haven't

1326
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,420
been accepted it might have more dupes

1327
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,220
because bugs haven't been resolved yet

1328
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,619
or alternatively there might be a lot of

1329
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:50,040
bugs in triage which are the same which

1330
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,700
might only differ by say a day

1331
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,220
if there's a low average payout they

1332
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,319
might be paying out a lot of p3s and p4s

1333
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,380
rather than p1s and p2s p1s and p2s

1334
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,819
especially in weird places are likely

1335
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:04,500
not to be duplicates

1336
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,079
so let's kind of Summer up all my advice

1337
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:08,160
here

1338
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,400
look in weird places develop expertise

1339
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,099
research things in depth don't limit

1340
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:17,280
your bug classes explore your Geographic

1341
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,980
or payment Gates check if it's using

1342
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,319
open source code play to your strengths

1343
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,240
look at program statistics these are my

1344
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,059
top tips and genuinely these are the

1345
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:29,819
tips that I use every single time I bug

1346
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:32,400
hunt and I don't get many duplicates

1347
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,339
I've gotten duplicates

1348
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:37,380
I think I've gotten like

1349
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,020
around

1350
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,400
one fifth of my bugs have been

1351
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,020
duplicates I'm not sure after my head

1352
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,579
but I think it's around one-fifth of my

1353
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,380
bugs have been duplicates because I

1354
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,520
don't look at the same place as everyone

1355
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,980
else and if you were to watch this video

1356
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,079
and you're like okay this is like a long

1357
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,660
video I'm tired what's the one piece of

1358
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:58,380
advice I need look in weird places

1359
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,720
don't just limit yourself to the main

1360
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,520
functionality of an app this doesn't

1361
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,740
mean don't test the main app this means

1362
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,300
don't test the main functionality of the

1363
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,280
main app you can find bugs in the main

1364
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,800
app yes even if you're don't think

1365
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,020
you're that good at bug hunting but

1366
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,300
looking in those weird places

1367
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,839
looking where nobody else is is really

1368
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,540
how you start to find

1369
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,400
um those bugs and find them consistency

1370
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,960
consistently

1371
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,000
my second like if you're only gonna

1372
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,319
listen to like two pieces of advice

1373
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,780
don't limit your bug classes learn a lot

1374
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,319
be open a lot keep your brain open write

1375
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,880
notes make sure you are constantly aware

1376
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,740
of

1377
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,480
um

1378
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,980
upcoming bugs or bugs that you might be

1379
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,440
able to find recognize those initial

1380
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,020
signs reach out to friends if you need

1381
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,540
help exploiting something but make sure

1382
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,280
you're not just testing for one type of

1383
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,300
bug

1384
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,000
so thank you very much for listening um

1385
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,500
if you'd like to watch more of my

channel

1388
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,140
um I make weekly videos that I've had a

1389
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,420
bit of a long break

1390
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,640
um I make weekly videos that all go

1391
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,359
around kind of new to bug hunting web

1392
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:15,240
application hacking and apis in

1393
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,160
particular I've done videos and

1394
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,599
everything from like modern web

1395
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:23,520
development to tooling and automation to

1396
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,099
how to use burp so they're very good

1397
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:27,900
place to start if you don't know a lot

1398
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,119
about bug hunting and I really recommend

1399
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:32,280
this playlist here now that's what I

1400
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,760
call bug bug bug bounty hunting 2020

1401
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,599
which is really like a good I think

1402
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,440
um

1403
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,960
starting to bug hunting that goes from

1404
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,440
like I'm just starting out to learning a

1405
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,720
bit about API hacking

1406
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,380
um

1407
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,780

my personal Twitter account so it does

1409
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:55,440
not fill up with bug Bounty tips but it

1410
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,780
does fill up with you know other things

1411
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:01,920
that isn't strictly related to hacking

1412
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,500
so thank you very much for listening

1413
