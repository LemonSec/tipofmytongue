1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,080
hey everybody this is z wink from z link

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,160
university and i am excited to be here

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,680
with bug crowd today to talk to you

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,880
about some of my favorite

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,360
vulnerabilities uh the broken access

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,080
control or insecure direct object

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,599
reference vulnerability which sounds way

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,160
more complicated than it needs to be um

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,520
first a little bit about me for those of

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,520
y'all that haven't heard of me i'm just

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,840
a lowly hacker and i hack almost

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,480
exclusively with bug crowd and i started

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,560
uh you know back in november of 2020

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,840
i've only been at this for about a year

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,960
and a half

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,280
but i have really grown to love it i

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,160
just participate part-time but um have

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,320
found great success very very quickly

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,960
with it and to me it's more of a hobby

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,200
and entertainment than it is like does

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,039
it feel like work you know so i like

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,600
doing it because it's fun and because

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,360
you can make a lot of money with it and

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,520
uh you know that's kind of my my drive

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,360
for doing it and i think a lot of other

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,039
people maybe do it just just you know

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,480
make a living um you know it just

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,879
depends on you know what your goals are

29
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,559
for why you participate in bug bounty

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,960
but um one of my favorite bugs to hunt

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,199
like i said this insecure direct object

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,960
reference um it sounds really

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
complicated right like that doesn't make

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,640
any sense to anybody that isn't in this

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,960
world already what it really means is

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,680
that you're switching an id with another

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,560
id

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,840
so like

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,439
take this take this for example and i

40
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,360
love starting off with this particular

41
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,960
example for how to explain this but

42
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,560
let's say you go to and i'm just

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,799
clicking tabs because i've got add let's

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,320
say you go to

45
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
a bank and you want to get some money

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,560
out of a bank right well um

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
you go into the bank and the bank teller

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,200
asks you uh oh hey welcome to you know

49
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280
the bank of awesome i i know you want to

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
get some money out can i see your id so

51
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,960
you take out your id which has your

52
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
picture and your name on it and you show

53
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,159
it to them and the bank teller looks at

54
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
the id and says well yeah that is you

55
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,720
isn't it it's got your face looks like

56
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,520
you okay cool thanks uh how much money

57
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,159
would you like and the person that wants

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,520
the money you i guess is like ten

59
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,119
thousand dollars that'd be wonderful so

60
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,799
then the teller's like cool uh what's

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
your account number and you know you're

62
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,000
like my account number is one two three

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
four five and then so the teller is like

64
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,799
okay

65
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,639
yeah yeah that's there cool here's ten

66
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,919
thousand dollars thank you have a good

67
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,959
day

68
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,160
the issue there is that the bank teller

69
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,800
while validating your identity like you

70
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
are who you say you are and that you're

71
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
authorized to be in the bank

72
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
neglected to check and see if account

73
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
one two three four five was actually

74
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,400
your account therefore you were able to

75
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,319
withdraw money from somebody else's bank

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,640
account now while that sounds ludicrous

77
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
like that would never happen in the real

78
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,480
world um it actually does more often

79
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
than you would believe and um the root

80
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
cause is that the the authentication

81
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,599
system on websites right that between

82
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,680
you know you and the website you've

83
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
logged in you've entered your username

84
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
your password you're authenticated and

85
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
the website's like cool you're logged in

86
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,640
you've got permission to all the stuff

87
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,599
and things

88
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,040
but the server doesn't check that the

89
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
stuff and things that you're requesting

90
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,680
back are actually yours and that's how

91
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
an insecure direct object reference

92
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
happens if you're user number one two

93
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,959
three four and you tell the server now

94
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,640
that you're logged in that you want user

95
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,720
one two three four five and it sends you

96
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,000
back their data or you're able to do

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,959
something with it well that's an

98
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,800
insecure direct object reference or what

99
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,519
i like to call an id substitution attack

100
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,400
so

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,680
i've been working with the pinterest

102
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,120
program for

103
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,879
i don't know you know often on a couple

104
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,239
of weeks now probably two and a half

105
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,640
three weeks and i've logged 43 bugs with

106
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,840
them which is what this is right here

107
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
and pinterest is a public program and

108
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
public programs usually very very

109
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
difficult to hack i think compared to

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,440
private programs because more people

111
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,959
have access to them they've been around

112
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,040
for ages public programs can often be

113
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,400
more difficult or at least more

114
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
intimidating but in my in my experience

115
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
in these last couple of weeks um it was

116
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
absolutely fabulous because pinterest

117
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,000
relies on ids for every object like you

118
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
have a user id and a pin id and then

119
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
your pin when you pin something belongs

120
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,280
to a board which has an id and then when

121
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
you're signed in you have a customer id

122
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,000
or a business id or an advertiser id and

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
then you have campaigns and analytic ids

124
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,400
and so it goes on and on and on there's

125
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,640
like 20 different id types and they all

126
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
use numbers like one two three four five

127
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,319
or five four three two one there's no

128
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,840
complexity to them at all and they're

129
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
sequential

130
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
so honestly pinterest was one of the

131
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,399
most fun targets i've worked on in a

132
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,160
while that's why i have it up it's a

133
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
great example of how to hunt for

134
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,400
insecure direct object references and

135
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
while it wasn't like easy or anything

136
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
but um it was a target that catered to

137
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
what it is i like to hunt for so i went

138
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
kind of deep on it it was really fun but

139
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
before we get into that right before we

140
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,600
get into looking at pinterest i want to

141
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
go through an actual example of you know

142
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
an idea or in a lab environment so what

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,560
i've got pulled up right here is um

144
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,680
well apparently the pinterest

145
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
documentation but apart from that we're

146
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,600
going to go back to that

147
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,840
port swiger web security academy is a

148
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,320
wonderful tool for getting to learn the

149
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,160
basic vulnerability types and practice

150
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,400
them in a safe working environment

151
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
so you could create a free account on

152
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,560
portswigger.net and this was one of the

153
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,919
tools that i used to learn what i was

154
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,400
doing um back in the day and i wish i

155
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,680
had gone through all the labs but i

156
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,960
didn't i just sort of toyed with them

157
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
but what we're going to do here is click

158
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,039
access the lab all right so we're going

159
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,520
to do that

160
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,039
and when we do that it's going to take

161
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,880
us over to a nice safe lab environment

162
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
now this is a lab that is meant to teach

163
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,880
insecure direct object references at

164
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,639
least on some level i i don't know

165
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,120
exactly what level that is but um what

166
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
they do is they take you over this nice

167
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,479
safe domain but this is your little

168
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,560
personal virtual environment so to speak

169
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,039
and what we want to do is scope burp

170
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,400
suite real quick just to pick up this

171
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,280
traffic so um i'm going to come over and

172
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,560
while we've got pinterest in there

173
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,680
already which i'm going to show you here

174
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,400
in a bit i want to go ahead and add

175
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,639
web security academy slash dot web

176
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,199
series academy dot net and now when we

177
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,720
refresh this page we should be getting

178
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,840
the traffic for it over here into burp

179
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,560
uh evolve as well and everybody's happy

180
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,680
this morning

181
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,000
and maybe i have the proxy turned off

182
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,039
because i do that sometimes

183
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
nah oh i have the proxy listener turned

184
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,800
off you know you can't find good help

185
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
these days so what we're gonna do we're

186
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,319
gonna go to target scopo

187
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,840
no proxy nope uh i'm having a moment

188
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
there we are and we're gonna check that

189
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
little box what

190
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,880
failed to start proxy service oh my gosh

191
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,400
well that was cool turns out i actually

192
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,759
had two copies of burp open all right

193
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,120
let's do that again

194
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
there we go intercept is off now we're

195
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,479
getting now we're getting payloads all

196
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,880
right and we're cooking with gas now

197
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
so what we're going to do is just look

198
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,400
at this lab for a second whenever you

199
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
get on a new target and you're hunting

200
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
for anything whether it's insecure

201
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,800
direct object reference or cross-site

202
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,960
scripting or you know your whatever your

203
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,720
favorite vulnerability type is you need

204
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
to click all the things right um you

205
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,639
you've got this gui expose the

206
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,759
developers i've so kindly given you so

207
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,960
you know the thing to do is pick your

208
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,639
favorite image like a person suspended

209
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,360
mid-air over a set person's just nuts

210
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,000
and uh click view details and so you

211
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,360
know that's all you can highlight

212
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
there's no other buttons on the screen

213
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,440
we click that um let's go back let's go

214
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
home let's click my account there's a

215
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,720
lot of buttons on this little test

216
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
website here right keeps it simple for

217
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,840
us we've got a login dialog we're going

218
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
to just do test tests so we do a log

219
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
payload there you know and then we're

220
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,759
going to click live chat

221
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,759
and um looks like there's something that

222
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,400
says you're now chatting with hal pine

223
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,960
your message hello hal fine

224
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
this is the wink

225
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,680
yes sin

226
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,560
now

227
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,400
there's also a view transcript button

228
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
let's click the view transcript button

229
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
because that will make another call

230
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,599
somewhere i don't know what it does

231
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,120
okay and download the text file on my

232
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
computer let's open that

233
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,199
connected now chatting with alpine hello

234
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,360
this is wink

235
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,479
okay cool

236
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,360
so

237
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,039
we've used basically every button i see

238
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,120
on the screen here so now let's go back

239
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,879
over to burke suite and see what we've

240
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,280
got okay um

241
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,840
there's our lab environment okay

242
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
uh let's go ahead and

243
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,759
get rid of all the unrequested items so

244
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,440
we're gonna say show only requested

245
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,199
unrequested items show up in gray and

246
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,199
they can clutter up the screen sometimes

247
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,080
so

248
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,000
here's what we did all right so we

249
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,680
clicked my account to look at the

250
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,280
products right and then we clicked the

251
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,520
login page then we made a post to the

252
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
login page with our username and

253
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,759
password down there test test and then

254
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,520
we clicked the head of the lab header

255
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
then we went to the chat page then we

256
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,160
posted a message to the chat dialog

257
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,639
right here as we can see in the screen

258
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,960
and then we apparently downloaded the

259
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,840
transcript with the name2.txt now

260
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,000
insecure direct object references do not

261
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
have to be

262
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
like

263
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,279
i guess straight numbers you know like

264
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,479
so

265
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,320
i i'm gonna go ahead and bring this over

266
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,919
and show you this here so we don't get

267
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,279
too far ahead of ourselves but what i

268
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,800
did was i went back through and audited

269
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,959
some of the uh insecure direct object

270
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
references again id substitution issues

271
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,399
that i blogged over the last year and a

272
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,000
half and i've got a couple hundred

273
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,519
thousand dollars of these log believe it

274
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,240
or not so they pay a lot of money um and

275
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,040
and they vary in severity so let's talk

276
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
a little bit through that before we

277
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,839
complete this lab

278
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,480
um and go any further so whenever i'm

279
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,760
testing um for for you know these issues

280
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,040
the thing to do is to have two

281
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,200
completely different accounts created so

282
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
you want to have one account that's your

283
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
you might call it your main account and

284
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,440
um it has its own set of id values right

285
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,600
so you'll have email one email.com and

286
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,160
it'll have its own ids assigned to it by

287
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,920
the system that you created in then

288
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
you'll create another user account with

289
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
a different email address and it will

290
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
get a different set of id values or

291
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
username email address or username

292
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
depending on how the system works and

293
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,160
now you've got two accounts that you own

294
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,880
that you can safely test with okay and

295
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
that's good because when you're testing

296
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,360
um these id substitution issues uh you

297
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,839
know making put requests post requests

298
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,839
patch requests and delete requests can

299
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,880
be

300
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,279
destructive and change the integrity of

301
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,440
somebody else's account if the issue is

302
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,880
real and you don't want to do that

303
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,240
especially in production environment so

304
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,839
it's better to test on your own test

305
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,959
accounts okay if you can um and and you

306
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,240
know if you're not sure error on the

307
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
side of caution i'll go a little bit

308
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,440
more into that uh here in a little bit

309
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
what we've got here on the screen is

310
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
just a subset of different ids that i

311
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,440
found um and there's a lot more than

312
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,800
this i didn't go through my entire list

313
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,240
but you know the big ones are going to

314
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
be things like user account user id and

315
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,839
account number like you see those in

316
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,360
almost every system right user id

317
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,160
account number um profile id those are

318
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,959
very common um phone number and email

319
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,640
address can also be things that you

320
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,079
could substitute for somebody else's and

321
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,640
get different data back um last name

322
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,880
sometimes in search filters or apis all

323
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,079
you need is a last name and you'll

324
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,160
return other people's data um

325
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,519
another you know other examples you can

326
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,600
read yourself coupon codes consumer ids

327
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
advertiser ids business ids social

328
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
security numbers themselves some systems

329
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,440
if you if you type in a social it'll

330
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,279
return back the data for your social

331
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,800
security number and if you type in

332
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,399
somebody else's social or return back

333
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,839
the data for their social security

334
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,000
number so what does that mean well that

335
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,560
means if you just randomly arbitrarily

336
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,079
loop over social security numbers

337
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,839
because they're only what nine digits or

338
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,440
something um you know and you get

339
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,640
somebody else's data back well that's a

340
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
data breach so those are those are p

341
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,880
ones right um premise ids that's like a

342
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,040
location itinerary ids and confirmation

343
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,880
codes things you get at like hotels or

344
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,440
um you know spa reservations whatever

345
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,279
ticket ids policy ids bank account

346
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,440
numbers you get the idea right uh even a

347
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,920
then even a complex long id like a then

348
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,279
can be an insecure direct object

349
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,480
reference okay

350
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,440
so

351
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
keep these things in mind it's basically

352
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,760
anything that refers to an object that

353
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
you can change and get somebody else's

354
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,600
data back or change somebody else's data

355
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,519
now back to our lab here we have um

356
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,720
2.txt was the name of our file so let's

357
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,399
send this to the repeater i usually just

358
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,160
right click send a repeater i do most of

359
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,519
my testing right here in the repeater

360
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,120
and i will get just sometimes i've got

361
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,880
hundreds of tabs in here it gets it gets

362
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,839
quick right

363
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,720
so

364
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,480
this right here is an object because

365
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,920
we're telling we're telling the file

366
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,839
system to retrieve file number two dot

367
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,880
txt the entire file name itself is

368
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,959
technically the object but more often

369
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,560
than not in a case like this you're

370
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,760
going to see

371
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,680
the number itself being iterative right

372
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,440
so the first chat session was maybe one

373
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
the second chat session's two the third

374
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,279
chat session's three and it goes up like

375
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,959
that so if we change it to a five just

376
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,079
to be weird and send it over um we get

377
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,760
back there no transcript that makes

378
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,040
sense right because probably there

379
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,959
haven't been five transcripts yet if we

380
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,959
send it back to number zero

381
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,480
and remember we just tinker right that's

382
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,639
what we do in cyber security we get no

383
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,839
transcript what happens if you give it a

384
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,639
negative value does it blow up no okay

385
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,680
so ours was two let's try the number one

386
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,600
okay cool so we got number one it says

387
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
now chatting with alpine hi hal i think

388
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
i forgot my password and new

389
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
confirmation sure no problem you seem

390
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,839
like a nice guy just tell me your

391
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,040
password i'll confirm whether it's

392
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,200
correct wow you're so nice thanks okay

393
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,320
my password is that so there you go um

394
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,480
this is a great example of

395
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
how you can get sensitive information

396
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,079
back from an insecure direct object

397
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,600
reference this was somebody else's chat

398
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,959
message and all i had to do was change

399
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,200
the number two to a number one up here

400
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
and get it back now should the person

401
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,880
have actually set their password in

402
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,360
plain text no should the server have

403
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,959
actually logged the password in plain

404
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,760
text no should the server have maybe

405
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
check whether or not i have access to

406
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,320
this transcript yes um but that's why

407
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,079
these things happen right and as i as i

408
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,079
explained i'm logged in right i am

409
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,680
logged into the system that's why i have

410
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,440
a session id or at least i have access

411
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,880
to the system i don't think i'm logged

412
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,639
in but you don't have access to it and

413
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,959
then now it's not saying that i have

414
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,800
permission to access this transcript

415
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
well this is a design flaw anyway

416
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,000
because the transcripts are

417
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
unauthenticated and since the

418
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,120
transcripts aren't authenticated there's

419
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,160
no access check to perform so really you

420
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
know this this is just not a good system

421
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,000
period there should be complex ids or

422
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
encrypted ids or some value that

423
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
requires a hash signature that expires

424
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,000
or something like that to retrieve these

425
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,440
documents back this is just the way

426
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,639
things were done in like 1987. so

427
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,720
that's just kind of the example here on

428
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,199
the port server web academy now

429
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,440
if we go over to um

430
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,680
we go back over to pinterest as i was

431
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,880
talking about

432
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,920
we see

433
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
as you're using the pinterest software

434
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,120
calls are made to the apis and you know

435
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,959
so you're clicking through pinterest.com

436
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,399
you're looking at pens you're looking at

437
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,079
boards you're commenting you're like oh

438
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,600
my gosh that's the coolest swimsuit i've

439
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,880
ever seen or whatever people do on

440
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,720
pinterest i don't know i'm not a user of

441
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,199
it um you know it makes all these calls

442
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,000
so as you're looking here even in the

443
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,800
urls you can see that there's these id

444
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
values in the path parameter all right

445
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,320
so let's let's look at these and talk

446
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,240
through it a little bit so we understand

447
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
what's up and i'm gonna pick a get

448
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,199
request here first

449
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,399
and for those of you out there that

450
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,480
think you're clever or whatever um

451
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,600
this is from a session from the 27th of

452
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,399
uh may so if these cookies still work

453
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,839
you are more than welcome to use them

454
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,519
but i'm gonna go out on them and say

455
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,000
they're not going to send a repeater

456
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,279
and um

457
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,199
get request okay so the first type of

458
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,519
insecure direct object reference testing

459
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,279
that i usually do are the get based

460
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,399
requests a get request is is doing

461
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,079
exactly what it sounds like in almost

462
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,320
all cases it is just retrieving data

463
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,839
from the system and bringing it back to

464
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,880
you okay

465
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,320
now um

466
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
a get request in this sense is saying

467
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,800
let's get the version 4

468
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,480
ads api the advertisers folder and then

469
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,560
i'm going to refer to this id right here

470
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,800
as an advertiser id and then i want to

471
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,399
grab the custom columns for that

472
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,839
advertiser now let's go ahead and send

473
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,760
that and it should say authorization

474
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
failed perfect proof that my cookies

475
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,360
don't work doesn't matter we're not

476
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,800
doing real testing here i'm teaching you

477
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,639
about idors

478
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,519
so what you would do here to test this

479
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,279
is you would change this to another id

480
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,160
value

481
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
that either you know because it's a get

482
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,920
request right that either you know

483
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,600
because you make two accounts when you

484
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
create um when when you get onto a

485
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
target you create two accounts so that

486
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
you already have a second number that

487
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,600
you know

488
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,320
or you can try to iterate the ids and

489
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,800
see if they're they're sequential um or

490
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,160
otherwise you just have to get lucky in

491
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
this case that's a really long number

492
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
right like that's uh what's that a

493
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,759
million a billion i don't know something

494
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,000
like a trillion numbers so what i would

495
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,199
do in this case if i were just

496
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,880
integrating these is i would just loop

497
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,240
over the last four now let me show you

498
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,839
this exercise you do get on target

499
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,199
sometimes when you don't have a second

500
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,959
id value and you need to be able to

501
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,959
prove this vulnerability so what we do

502
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,279
is we right click on this and we send it

503
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,199
to the intruder okay

504
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,880
and i do this a lot and you hit clear

505
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,000
clear the little dollar signs that

506
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,839
aren't dollar signs and all you got to

507
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,600
do is highlight these first four numbers

508
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
right here and click add dollar sign

509
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,120
really fun stuff

510
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,279
and then we come over here to payloads

511
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,800
and you change it to number right here

512
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,040
you say numbers now what it's doing is

513
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,160
it's saying from 6149 to something now

514
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,079
here's the way my brain works assuming

515
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,759
these things are sequential all right

516
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,519
assuming these are sequential when i

517
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,600
created this account i had the highest

518
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,519
number of this account when i created it

519
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,440
which means if a whole bunch of other

520
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,839
accounts have not been created since i

521
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,199
might actually be the most recent

522
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,079
account therefore looping upwards and

523
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,600
count may not actually find a new id so

524
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,160
to err on the side of awesome i actually

525
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,720
loop backwards so instead of looping

526
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
from a number to a higher number i would

527
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,160
from a number to a lower number like

528
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,439
zero

529
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,359
and i'm going to do a step of negative

530
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,720
one which tells the system to go

531
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,760
backwards one uh integer each step and

532
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
then i tell it a minimum of four digits

533
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,359
and a max of four digits so what that's

534
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,720
going to do is make sure we have zero

535
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,640
zero zero zero instead of just zero

536
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,359
there so if i hit start on this now what

537
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,599
you'll see is um

538
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,679
burp popping up on my other monitor

539
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,919
and let's go ahead and pause this

540
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,760
and as you can see it's counting down

541
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,200
now the integers really fast um and it's

542
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,880
telling us whether or not something

543
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,480
happened now were we authenticated and

544
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
have a vowel authentication token

545
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,799
um if this were working what you would

546
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,000
probably see is a 200 response code for

547
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,760
any of them that were valid and you

548
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,919
would see a 401 or a 403 for any that

549
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,760
weren't so the status code is the most

550
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,039
important field to look at when you're

551
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,400
doing this and this is a really quick

552
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
way to try to find another account and

553
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
see if you get other data back for it

554
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,480
all right cool so let's discard that um

555
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,360
so that is one way to sort of do batch

556
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,799
testing but again it's good to have

557
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,880
multiple id values that you could just

558
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,720
copy and paste right there yourself and

559
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,520
do the testing now this is called a path

560
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,320
based a uri path based

561
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,120
object reference okay so this is in the

562
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,000
path

563
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,960
of the uri now you also see them as

564
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,720
parameters and i think i saw one over

565
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,120
here yes right there let's go send this

566
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
to the repeater now

567
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,280
very similarly you will also see them as

568
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,200
parameters a lot of times in in the

569
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,720
request so

570
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
um

571
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,480
it's always good to do uh the testing on

572
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,039
the parameters as well now

573
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,720
what you'll also see sometimes on

574
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,360
targets is nothing at all it'll just say

575
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,840
ads internal preferences like that and

576
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,080
what you can do is you get a sense of

577
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,000
through testing the target the types of

578
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
parameters that it uses like we know

579
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
that it's using advertiser id to call

580
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,520
advertiser ids like it's called

581
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
advertiser underscore id

582
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
and we see that over here we see it over

583
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,760
here we see it over here well then there

584
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,240
is some amount of probability that you

585
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,480
can probably add the advertiser id

586
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,400
parameter to other requests where you're

587
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,240
not actually seeing it

588
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,200
and it will do uh it will do a lookup on

589
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,360
the advertiser id just because you don't

590
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,320
see a parameter on a url call especially

591
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,559
apis doesn't mean that it doesn't

592
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,240
support it see right here we have a

593
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,280
user's equals parameter with um one

594
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,799
value but what's interesting is it's

595
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,440
users plural so what happens if you do a

596
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,679
user id parameter comma another one

597
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,799
right so part of idor testing or id

598
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,640
substitution testing is also trying to

599
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
find hidden places where the values are

600
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,799
accepted and you can change them

601
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,960
the more hidden of a

602
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,720
vector you can find the more likely it

603
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,240
is to be a valid issue because less

604
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,679
people have probably found it so you

605
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,120
have to be creative with looking for

606
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,679
them sometimes too so you know keep that

607
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,760
in mind keep an eye out for parameters

608
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
and populate yourself a list that you're

609
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,080
keeping track of parameter values and

610
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,799
then use that list to try to brute force

611
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,400
parameters on other endpoints okay

612
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,679
that doesn't always work but it

613
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,600
sometimes works i'm trying to look for

614
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
an example if they have one that has

615
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,720
both yes beautiful cinder repeater so on

616
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,080
this one we have we have both a path

617
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,440
object and we have a parameter object

618
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
now these are interesting because it's

619
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,000
usually only obeying one of them or it's

620
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
only doing a security check on one of

621
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,919
them and and so you want to test them

622
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,320
both simultaneously and individually to

623
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
see what happens so you would change

624
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,960
this to another id send the payload see

625
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,880
what happens then you would put this

626
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,440
back how it was change this to another

627
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
id send the payload see what happens and

628
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,280
then change them both at the same time

629
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,799
send the payload and see what happens

630
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,360
okay and because this was just using

631
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,919
advertiser not advertiser underscore id

632
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,280
so see the parameter value is a little

633
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
different there too and you gotta you

634
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,240
gotta send the values and see how they

635
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
wiggle now that's essentially all there

636
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,159
is to it for testing these and get

637
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,080
requests the key is finding them again

638
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,919
the key is finding them you need to use

639
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,080
every single button you can find in the

640
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,240
in the software and people skip over the

641
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,360
buttons all the time they get to a

642
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,280
credit card dialogue and they and they

643
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,640
leave it they don't go any further or

644
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,919
they'll get to an ad bank account

645
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,200
dialogue and they leave it they don't

646
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
get any further if you can

647
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,760
get a test credit card get a test bank

648
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,080
account get anything you can especially

649
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,840
the financial stuff that you can to test

650
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
the system deeper because most hackers

651
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,919
will not enter financial data to test

652
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,520
those parts of the system which is

653
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,440
ironic because those parts of the system

654
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,000
are actually more critical

655
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,480
so uh you know it's something to think

656
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
about right if you get to a point when

657
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,880
you're testing and you think wow i don't

658
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,960
really want to test that ask yourself i

659
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,400
wonder if every other hacker thought

660
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,159
that too and maybe that's an opportunity

661
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,919
for me to find something they didn't

662
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,200
okay

663
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,280
just saying um

664
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,120
now those are get requests the other

665
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,559
type of requests you're gonna see are

666
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,880
things like posts okay now let's go

667
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,159
ahead and send this one to the repeater

668
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,440
so we can look at

669
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,240
this is a post request to an advertiser

670
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,120
id

671
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,720
but there's also let me go ahead and

672
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
send this so it makes it pretty there we

673
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,840
go so there's also a id down here in the

674
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,159
payload body as well now like i said

675
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,440
post request put request patch request

676
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,080
and deletes and you see this up here

677
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,520
right in the headers that's the type of

678
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,600
request it is those are requests that

679
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,760
are designed to change something more

680
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,840
often than not it's going to

681
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
send data to the system that may change

682
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,559
a user account or change a profile

683
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,120
or change something delete something

684
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,880
right so that's called an integrity

685
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,520
impact and when you're testing these you

686
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,039
absolutely absolutely do not try to loop

687
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,520
over somebody else's advertiser id and

688
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,440
send these requests okay because you

689
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,000
might accidentally change a real

690
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,440
person's data out there and you might be

691
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,799
like well i don't care they shouldn't

692
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,480
let me well don't test like that we're

693
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,320
white hat hackers okay we're not we're

694
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,480
not out there we're not gray we're not

695
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,640
black hat we're just trying to find bugs

696
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,320
help companies get paid for it okay

697
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,159
that's kind of the recipe find bugs help

698
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,919
companies get paid for it that's it

699
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,120
that's what we do

700
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,799
so you're not helping a company very

701
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,559
much if you're finding bugs breaking

702
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,480
people's account getting paid for it

703
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,880
that's that's the wrong step um so again

704
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,480
have a second account that you own so

705
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,919
that you can test these type of

706
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,919
vulnerabilities so what i would do here

707
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,520
i would change this number to the other

708
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,480
account that i own and i would see if it

709
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,400
changed something or brought back data

710
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,240
um for that other account and you know

711
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,679
you want to have two browser windows

712
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,120
open when you do this so you can log

713
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,280
into the second account and look in real

714
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,799
time and see if it's information has

715
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,720
been modified and that's how you know

716
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,000
it's working right so you would be

717
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,679
logged in as account one right here with

718
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,440
the count months cookies you would

719
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,919
change the ids to account two's id

720
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,960
values and then if on account two you

721
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
see a change based on what you did you

722
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,440
know that you have an idor or id

723
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
substitution issue that has an integrity

724
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,840
impact integrity impacts tend to be

725
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,799
lower honestly in most cases unless

726
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,960
it'll it leads to an account takeover or

727
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,120
a password reset or some kind of

728
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,200
functionality that you know i mean worst

729
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,799
case normally it's a denial of service

730
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,320
right which is a p2 assuming it's

731
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,480
critical and easy um

732
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,240
but if it leads to account takeover you

733
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,640
can get a p1 via integrity impact sort

734
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,559
of idors but the ones i like to hunt

735
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,799
first are the get request based idors

736
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,080
because they tend to bring back bulk pii

737
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,799
like personal identifiable information

738
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,039
for people like you know credit card

739
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,640
numbers or account numbers or bank

740
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,480
account numbers or driver's license or

741
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,159
social security or date of birth or

742
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,080
email or phone or address or name you

743
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,799
know all these things are potentially

744
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,480
bad for companies especially when you

745
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,080
can get them in the number of millions

746
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,880
right

747
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,240
now

748
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,600
once you're done testing these

749
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,159
individually one by one next step i

750
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,919
normally look for

751
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,279
api endpoints or docs or i go to github

752
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,880
or the wayback engine or the search

753
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,480
engines and i just try to find any other

754
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,799
urls i can't what i want to show you on

755
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,960
the screen next is

756
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,799
um an api dock that i found for

757
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,480
pinterest you won't be able to access

758
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,360
this

759
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
so you know enjoy but uh

760
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,799
i i had to do a thing and a stuff to be

761
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,320
able to even get into this but let's

762
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,000
just say that they exist

763
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,480
and um when you find something like this

764
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,400
right where you have just thousands and

765
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,480
thousands of api endpoints that are

766
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,080
listed and all their functionalities and

767
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
everything this is just a use of v3

768
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,559
users endpoint um what i do is i

769
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,960
highlight it just like that okay and

770
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
i'll come over here and let's just do it

771
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
in here and i'll paste it in the notepad

772
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,559
plus plus i really love working in

773
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,880
notepad plus plus it is my jam i use it

774
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,640
all the time and what i'm going to do is

775
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,919
i'm going to type i'm going to do a find

776
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,360
and replace i'm just going to put a

777
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
space in and i'm going to hit replace

778
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,760
all you need to you need to learn how to

779
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
do things efficiently like this to be

780
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,440
able to you know get the most out of

781
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,760
your testing time so i'll now put in the

782
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,679
word put and hit replace all and i'll

783
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,000
put in the word get and i'll hit replace

784
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,240
all and i'll put in the word post and

785
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,000
replace all which i think just leaves

786
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,559
delete and then replace all and now what

787
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,200
i've got is a nice clean list of url

788
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,559
stems less the commas replace all

789
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,400
i said combo period there we go and so

790
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,919
now we've got this nice beautiful list

791
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,640
now anywhere in this particular syntax

792
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,799
where you see user what we can do is

793
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,880
just take that and change it to one two

794
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,120
three four five or whatever a user value

795
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,080
is right

796
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,679
and um

797
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,679
these look like their user values two

798
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,080
right there and follow e would also be a

799
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,360
user value and reported user would be a

800
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,000
user value as well so now we've got this

801
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,240
nice list

802
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,840
pre-populated with user objects that we

803
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,039
can go and sort of test and batch real

804
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,440
fast okay so i'm going to copy that and

805
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
show you how i do this we're going to go

806
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
back to our intruder

807
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,120
and all we have to do is you take any

808
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,559
given request you send it to the

809
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,600
intruder

810
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,840
and you highlight the url stem right

811
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,320
here okay just hit add a little dollar

812
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
signs that are dollar signs we come over

813
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,400
here to payloads um we got to set it

814
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,159
back to simple list which is the default

815
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,679
and we just hit paste

816
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,960
so now we've got 101 pre-populated v3

817
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,760
users urls already in here

818
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,320
and all we got to do now is just uncheck

819
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,760
url encode these characters so it

820
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,919
doesn't url encode slashes

821
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,840
and we hit start okay and we're going to

822
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,520
get out of 401 on all of these because

823
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,919
i'm not actually authenticated but the

824
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,600
point being is that you saw it just

825
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,360
tested 101 urls for us and like um

826
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,600
i don't know really fast right

827
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,760
and when you're doing this like i said

828
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,279
the status code is the number one thing

829
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,960
you're looking for you're looking for

830
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,279
like 200 response codes indicating that

831
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,039
your cookies work to return some other

832
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,520
users data but i want to caveat that and

833
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,159
say remember um automation lacks the

834
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,320
context to understand

835
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,399
um that a 200 response code is not

836
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,960
necessarily bad for example

837
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,120
boards this would have returned a 200

838
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,720
response code for another user i know it

839
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,960
does and that's okay because pinterest

840
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,480
wants you to be able to see another

841
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
user's boards automation doesn't

842
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,840
understand that it's going to flag it

843
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,279
immediately and it's going to say this

844
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,520
is a vulnerability go get paid for it

845
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,279
but the human brain because we're

846
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,120
brilliant people right we go in there

847
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,799
and we say oh that's just a pinterest

848
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,000
board pinterest wants you to be able to

849
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,240
see that that's not an issue okay but if

850
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,399
there was some other particular call in

851
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,799
here like the friends that the user has

852
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,000
which i don't think you're supposed to

853
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,960
be able to see and that return to 200

854
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,640
now you have an issue right you can see

855
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,799
a user's friend's connection which is

856
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,720
not something that's exposed on the

857
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,679
public profile followers is who you're

858
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,039
following is but who you're friends with

859
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,360
is not um so it's something worth

860
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,320
keeping in mind right that um

861
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,000
you need to you need to understand the

862
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,159
context of the target and what it is

863
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,080
that is valuable to the program that you

864
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,840
can lock for instance if you didn't know

865
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,520
that there were public and private

866
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
boards you wouldn't know that if you

867
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
could access somebody's board that was

868
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,440
marked private that you could get paid

869
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,279
for it right you need to understand the

870
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,360
target so make sure and this is part of

871
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,880
that clicking through the gui in the

872
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,960
beginning make sure you understand your

873
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,120
target and that you're learning all the

874
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,200
options and toggle settings as you're

875
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,480
clicking through it especially the

876
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,159
privacy and security settings so that

877
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,480
you understand as an attacker how you

878
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,279
can circumvent them if you know that a

879
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,760
pin or a board can be more private then

880
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,440
you know that you should not be able to

881
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,679
access a pin or a private board from a

882
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,360
user account which does not have access

883
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,559
to it right makes sense so context is

884
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,640
king i'm going to rip that off from star

885
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
trek i think in this particular case

886
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,559
let's go ahead and close that down guys

887
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,159
that is pretty much

888
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,919
insecure direct object reference or id

889
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,600
substitution hacking in a nutshell i

890
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,679
mean you've seen it all right here the

891
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,600
only other thing i would say is that

892
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,159
sometimes you have ids that don't look

893
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,840
quite so simple and let's do a quick

894
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,559
example of this let's say you had um you

895
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,600
see a lot of alphanumeric values like x

896
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,279
y

897
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,039
2 j and

898
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,840
l i did one of these the other day okay

899
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,679
what happens here is you've got

900
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,640
combinations of a through z and zero

901
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
through nine in different places okay

902
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,520
and

903
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,200
this may look like something you can't

904
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,600
brute force or or whatever but it's

905
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,360
actually really simple let's just show

906
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,520
an example here let's just say

907
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,240
we keep j l static and we want to loop

908
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,480
over um x y

909
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,600
two

910
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,840
just hit add dollar signs come over here

911
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,320
to payloads and what we wanna do is come

912
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,520
down to something called the brute

913
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,080
forcer okay and all you got to do is

914
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,440
change these to all caps we're going to

915
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,000
assume it's case sensitive a b c d e f g

916
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,279
h i t

917
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,559
o p q r u v w x y z

918
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,880
i can't spell okay that's the alphabet

919
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,279
so um now all we're going to do is how

920
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,960
many how many characters was that remind

921
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,240
me three

922
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,720
so for every

923
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,039
possible combination of a through z and

924
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,480
zero through nine

925
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,520
it will try um it will try those three

926
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,799
characters so that's forty 46 656

927
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,440
possible combinations you just keep jml

928
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,600
static to keep it simple at first and

929
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,679
you know you just blow through this and

930
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,399
chances are based on um you know the

931
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,399
entropy you're going to get a hit and if

932
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,679
you don't you just add one more

933
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,679
character to it and go with it it's the

934
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,840
whole point of an idr isn't is it

935
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,200
proving that you can get to everybody's

936
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,320
account so much as you can get to

937
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,559
anybody's account so as long as you can

938
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,000
get one more hit and you could start

939
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,679
simple you could literally just loop

940
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,840
through the last character a to z that's

941
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,360
actually probably what i would do if you

942
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,840
had this i would start with x y 2 j n i

943
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,600
would come over here to payloads i would

944
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,360
simply take off the 0 through 9 change

945
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,880
this to 1 change this to 1. now we've

946
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,120
got 26 payloads hey that's the alphabet

947
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,840
right

948
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,519
and we would try that if that didn't

949
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,279
work i would grow it by one and i would

950
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,960
do these two because you know don't

951
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,039
don't take the time to wait for 46 000

952
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,559
or 46 million payloads and all you

953
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,200
needed to do was to try 26 to figure out

954
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,000
if somebody else's account was there

955
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,880
or again if you have access to a second

956
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,480
account that you can create which is

957
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
always better just try to get to that

958
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,240
from your other account but in this in

959
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,679
this particular case the other day when

960
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,519
i was doing this these were actually

961
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,519
flight confirmations and i wasn't able

962
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,760
to create a second flight confirmation

963
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,240
so i only have one and then from the one

964
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,679
i found the payload from the payload i

965
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,039
needed to prove i could get to a second

966
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,320
so i actually had to do some brute

967
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,080
forcing and that does come up from time

968
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,200
to time

969
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,279
again everybody thanks for listening uh

970
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,720
these are my favorite bugs to hack you

971
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,399
can you can make a buku of money off of

972
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,919
these and they're super easy as you can

973
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,240
see it doesn't require rocket surgery or

974
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,399
any sort of super duper programming and

975
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,640
hackerisms and you know things that look

976
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,320
really complicated it's just swapping

977
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,519
ids out okay but please please please

978
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,360
please please please try to find them so

979
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,640
i feel like i tell you something that

980
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,880
would be amazing um i'm z wink again

981
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,399
from zwink university check out my

982
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,080
youtube channel for uh more information

983
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,000
i want to give a big shout out to bug

984
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,159
