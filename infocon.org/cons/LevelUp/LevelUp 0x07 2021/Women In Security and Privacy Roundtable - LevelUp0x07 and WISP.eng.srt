dublin ireland

125
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,720
um the main objectives of wisp are

126
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,760

in security and privacy

130
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
so um i know that they've done some

131
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
amazing workshops they do a defcon prep

132
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,319
series

133
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,840
to prepare people for the defcon

134
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
conference there's scholarships for

135
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
training and conferences

136
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
and uh recently they just did a really

137
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,960
awesome campaign

138
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
and partnered with share the mic in

139
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,120
cyber where they were working to cover

140
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
training certification and education

141
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
costs that are incurred by

142
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,040
black security and privacy practitioners

143
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,800
so it started out as a very

144
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,160
um initially just to get one person's

145
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,800
oscp covered in certification of an exam

146
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
and it actually morphed into this wider

147
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,080
initiative to cover as many

148
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,000
training certification and learning

149
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,919
expenses for black practitioners

150
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
in cyber security so they recently

151
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,199
raised 25

152
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,280
000 in order to get some more

153
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,800
certifications and

154
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,960

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,880
um did anyone have a favorite talk or

173
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,080
village this year

174
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,919
um you know don't all volunteer at once

175
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,280
but um

176
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,639
did anybody have a chance to check it

177
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,560
out i mean i made

178
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,280
two videos on the topic first was some

179
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,360
recommendations for like bug bounty

180
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,560
hunting

181
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
and bug bounty hunting adjacent talks

182
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,440
um i scoured through every single

183
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,039
village noting down which ones i thought

184
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,400
were most interesting

185
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,720
and then didn't attend them because i

186
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,600
was doing

187
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
the ai village because i

188
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,840
like ai and i want to know more about it

189
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,080
last year i went to defcon paid for my

190
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,240
ticket did everything i went to defcon

191
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,360
for one hour

192
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,199
and watched one talk and that was it

193
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,600
because i was absolutely knackered

194
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
from all of the other networking stuff

195
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
happening at def con

196
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
that's awesome i think that means you

197
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
did it right yeah i know that's what i'm

198
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,120
hearing

199
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
other than attending our wonderful bug

200
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,800
crowd events just kidding

201
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
uh we actually didn't do too much with

202
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
def on this year but um i did get a

203
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,080
chance to check out a couple of villages

204
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,560
um

205
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
we also have had um cat made an amazing

206
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,800
bug crowd badge for defcon one of the

207
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,600
years as well

208
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,319
um do you want to talk about that sure

209
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:46,720
yeah

210
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,560
um a group of three of us at bug crowd

211
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,880
kind of decided that we were gonna do

212
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,599
this thing that

213
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,440
people had been talking about for a long

214
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
time but never did which was

215
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,639
make a bug crowd badge um so we got

216
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,280
together

217
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,199
and just kind of winged it um

218
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
i mean i don't think any of us had any

219
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,479
experience really with

220
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,680
like printing a pcb before

221
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,639
what goes into that and so yeah we made

222
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,000
a bug card badge it was

223
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,280
um it uh

224
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,599
had not actually walked there um like

225
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,880
there was an entire

226
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,960
um puzzle uh to go through as well

227
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,319
and a web component for it um so

228
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,840
yeah it was really cool and we taught

229
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,240
people how to solder at our um

230
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,400
at our room i remember people were

231
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
really excited about the twitter drops

232
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,720
too

233
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
like we would do those like random

234
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
twitter drops and i would see people

235
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,560
like

236
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
running across conference halls in order

237
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
to go i was like

238
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
oh my god what did i get myself into

239
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,400
yeah there was um

240
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
one time we did a drop in one of the

241
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,879
elevators and so i just stood in one of

242
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,560
those defcon elevators

243
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
like in caesar's riding it up and down

244
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
for like 45 minutes which is kind of a

245
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
nightmare

246
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
and there were people that would just

247
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,440
like the doors would open and they would

248
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,560
just like yell like

249
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
is there a blue card badge in here

250
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
oh my god that would be terrifying

251
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,560
especially like

252
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,479
isn't there like the three two one rule

253
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,080
where like you have to make sure that

254
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,639
you know

255
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,319
you smell okay like some people don't

256
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
follow that so like being in an elevator

257
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,840
for 45 minutes with that

258
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
um

259
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,520
were you able to check out any of safe

260
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,280
mode this year

261
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
uh yeah actually i've never attended

262
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
defcon uh

263
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,120
in person but this was the first year i

264
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,880
attended it online

265
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
uh i've actually found the career

266
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,559
hacking village really

267
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,399
interesting it was very very

268
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,760
inspirational um

269
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,800
especially there was one talk which uh i

270
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
think was i don't remember the name

271
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,360
i think pablo brewer i hope i'm not

272
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,000
butchering the

273
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,200
name but he talked about a lot of uh

274
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
like the pros and cons of having a

275
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,320
certification

276
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
uh or having a degree especially having

277
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,000
a degree in an unrelated field

278
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,519
and then going into infrastructure which

279
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,920
was really i mean uh it gave me a really

280
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,399
interesting

281
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,240
perspective because i have a degree in

282
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
mass media and then i went into infosec

283
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,640
so

284
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
it was something uh he presented it

285
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,080
really well yeah

286
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,959
nice yeah um that actually is a good

287
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,480
lead into my next question

288
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,040
which um for me like when i go to defcon

289
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
the first time that i went

290
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,440
i saw the hardware hacking village and

291
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
we did like a partnership

292
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
where we were doing hardware hacking on

293
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,399
those um scooters that are on the

294
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,519
streets

295
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,600
and so um watching somebody like take

296
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
that apart and like solder it and like

297
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,279
sparks were flying i had never seen that

298
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:39,920
before

299
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
and so my mind was blown and i was like

300
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
oh my god i need to learn how to

301
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,080
hardware hack

302
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,640
um so my question leading into that is

303
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
um what's one area of hacking you'd like

304
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,160
to try but probably haven't had the

305
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,800
chance to

306
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,279
yet um let's go with 3m on this one for

307
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,519
the first one

308
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
sure um one of my big things is that i

309
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,279
wanted to do more soldering i've done a

310
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,560
little bit of it uh

311
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,360
at i think it was diana not tiara khan i

312
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
think it was that year

313
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
um and i have a couple of badges that

314
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,399
i've gotten to assemble and just

315
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,079
haven't yet um yeah i have some catching

316
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,680
up to do with diana initiative videos

317
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
for their project this year i got a

318
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
giant accidentally giant bag of leds

319
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,200
from china

320
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
in order to make a few so yeah if i

321
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
don't i'm going to be stuck with 150

322
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,839
little lights for the rest of my life

323
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,640
i mean you could do one of those like uh

324
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
challenges where you stick them on your

325
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,959
face

326
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,000
yeah um how about you katie

327
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,440
what's one area of packing you might

328
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,360
want to try

329
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,000
so i'm quite well known for my api

330
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
hacking because i think it's

331
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,040
great for finding books but one thing i

332
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,399
really like to especially like myself is

333
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,640
focus on how you can exploit ai systems

334
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,920
um they can often be like really complex

335
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,519
pipelines where

336
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,360
an image might go through several

337
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
different programs even though you only

338
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
see a web interface

339
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,200
um so it's something i really want to

340
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,320
pick up though

341
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,959
unrelated i do also want to get better

342
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,720
at video editing because i edit all my

343
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
own videos

344
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
um not relate to hacking but definitely

345
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,360
a skill i need to learn in 2020

346
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,519
2021 i mean if you guys haven't seen it

347
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,880
out there in the universe definitely

348
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,440
check out

349
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
insider phd's channel because she does

350
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,120
have some amazing videos she is short

351
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,640
telling herself right now

352
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
but here's some really incredible um

353
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
content that's out there for

354
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,399
uh if you're getting started in hacking

355
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,079
just same as farah so

356
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,279
definitely recommend checking out but

357
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,519
i'm with you i definitely uh we have

358
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,200
like a great team here at bug crowd and

359
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
there's somebody that made all the

360
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,880
amazing graphics for level up and i see

361
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,680
that and i'm like

362
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,279
oh my god i need to learn how to do this

363
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,000
that's so cool

364
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
um how about you cat any areas of

365
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,800
hacking you might want to try

366
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,519
um yeah i feel like i've kind of gotten

367
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,800
a little taste of

368
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
a number of different things like web

369
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,959
hacking and hardware hacking

370
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,240
um but i've actually i've never tried um

371
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,279
the social engineering stuff really um

372
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,160
and i think that that could be a really

373
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,880
interesting

374
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
exercise for me as somebody that's not

375
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,320
very like

376
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,120
um you know i never did like acting or

377
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,079
anything like that

378
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,600
um i think that could be a fun challenge

379
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,959
yeah um if uh that's a great lead into

380
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,720
um another thing that i was interested

381
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,279
in um the voting village at defcon um

382
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,519
it was a good segue where rachel toback

383
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,000
did amazing hacking video on the voting

384
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
machines that were at the voting village

385
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,399
at def con

386
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,320
i gotta say um she's our chairman of the

387
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
board for wisp by the way

388
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,079
um she's fantastic and i think this was

389
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,000
maybe a couple of deaf cons ago but she

390
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,600
was talking about

391
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,680
the election concerns and how voting

392
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,120
machines can be tampered with

393
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
and everything else so i'd like to ask

394
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,480
this panel um

395
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
do you guys have any election concerns

396
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,160
do you think that the election might be

397
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,600
able to be hacked

398
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
um i mean i think this is open to any of

399
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,839
you for even if you don't live in the us

400
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,360
i think that it's kind of

401
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,959
overall maybe from the outsider

402
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,480
perspective i'd even be interested in

403
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,600
so in the uk we don't have machines to

404
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:11,920
vote

405
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,560
you pick a piece of paper you make a

406
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,519
marking

407
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,680
in the box now i should say in the uk a

408
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,399
marking in the box is a very broad term

409
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,000
as long as it's clear who you're voting

410
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,399
for it counts the idea of using a

411
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,360
machine

412
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
terrifies me it's like especially

413
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,000
watching

414
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
you know the kids who then hack voting

415
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,279
machines

416
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,760
absolutely terrifying you just need to

417
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,800
get a bunch of

418
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,560
people in a room and just count them by

419
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,079
hand it's

420
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,440
crazy that you use machines to do it

421
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,160
just for me crazy though i will say i

422
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
think the risk of election hacking is

423
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,959
maybe not

424
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,639
attackers but perhaps your own

425
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,320
government at the moment because it's

426
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
not looking so great

427
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,959
for dismantling the postal service

428
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,320
oh no oh no yeah i've seen a couple of

429
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,440
them barred up with the red bars

430
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,800
which is not great um

431
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
i'll pass the question to uh farah as

432
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,079
well

433
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,560
uh do you know anything about election

434
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,920
security do you think that there's

435
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,440
hacking concerns for election security

436
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,720
uh well i think right now uh

437
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,560
i think my biggest concern with

438
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,480
elections uh would be

439
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,959
that there's no uh physical rallies

440
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,839
everything is

441
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,160
uh like there's everyone's fighting it

442
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,519
from their basements

443
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,600
so i think my biggest concern would be

444
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,720
uh more

445
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,040
towards the social media and the news

446
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,560
and uh

447
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,199
every country trying to uh affect the

448
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,160
outcome of the

449
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,040
elections and it's also like uh

450
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,199
everyone's trying to get access to

451
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,600
people's preferences especially in the

452
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
swing states i

453
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,120
think uh i think that would be my

454
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,800
biggest concern because

455
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,800
i think we're too small what uh

456
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,240
actually is happening and who's doing

457
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
what

458
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,320
yeah that's a good point um cat or

459
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,680
brienne do you have anything you'd like

460
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,880
to add yeah um

461
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,519
i think um my biggest concern doesn't

462
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,160
have to

463
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,199
do so much with the voting machine

464
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,160
technology

465
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,639
um i think that our elections in a sense

466
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,600
have

467
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,680
have already been hacked for many many

468
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,519
years if you look at you know

469
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,160
gerrymandering and redlining and those

470
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,880
sorts of things

471
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,000
those could be considered a hack of how

472
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,639
you kind of

473
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,160
um you know sway the results to get the

474
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,360
outcome that you want

475
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,079
so i think my biggest concern is that

476
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,199
the results

477
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,000
um whatever they are will become will be

478
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,800
meaningless

479
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,480
and that there may not be a peaceful

480
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
transition of power this time around

481
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,320
um because we've seen increasingly that

482
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,480
the hacking is not so much modifying

483
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
the results it's about pitting two sides

484
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
against each other to cause this

485
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,839
chaos and frustration and

486
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,240
desensitization

487
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,399
and you know eventually people just

488
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,920
become apathetic to that

489
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,240
yeah that's a great point and uh i know

490
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,720
for me

491
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,800
like i had to check my voter

492
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
registration and i thought it was all

493
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,240
all set up and everything was ready to

494
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
go and i was sure of it and sure enough

495
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,360
i had to re-register it so i know for me

496
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
i'm concerned that

497
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,720
that happens to other people and that

498
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,160
they're not actively checking their

499
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,279
voter registration

500
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,880
or really even just exercising their

501
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,199
right to vote so i know for me like

502
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,560
as my my side of things you know i think

503
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,880
that

504
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,800
to protect our elections we absolutely

505
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
need to make sure that we're

506
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
checking in on voter registration and

507
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,040
getting people

508
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,079
informed and registered to vote

509
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,920
i think that's really important just in

510
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,279
general to stress

511
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,759
that even if you think an election can

512
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,880
be hacked

513
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,639
even if you're worried about the outcome

514
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,120
of the election it's really important if

515
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,119
you can with safety concerns considering

516
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,160
kovic

517
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,079
to get out there and make sure your

518
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,199
voice is heard

519
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,319
even if you're shouting into the void

520
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,280
you if we have 30 people shouting into

521
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,599
the

522
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,520
into what they consider a void you've

523
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,199
actually got a combined voice there and

524
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,640
it's really important

525
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,599
to vote anyway even if even if you think

526
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,480
the election

527
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,000
is completely uber or you've been called

528
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,080
you've still got to vote there have been

529
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,600
places in the uk

530
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,799
that have been um like controlled i

531
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,640
think on 20 votes

532
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,600
wow to change an mp so it's really

533
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,919
important to exercise your right to vote

534
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,360
absolutely um that's a absolutely

535
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,799
um okay cool so um i think let's

536
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,880
shift our gears a little bit um thank

537
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,720
you for speaking on that and i do think

538
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,080
that it is important that

539
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,280
people are registered to vote and that

540
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,960
they pay attention to our elections and

541
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,559
the news if they can

542
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,160
but i want to shift a little bit into

543
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,760
the infosec community

544
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,280
and i'm talking about community

545
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,039
demographics because um

546
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,400
i think that's part of it it's part of

547
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,559
being in the community and uplifting

548
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,200
each other

549
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,120
um so right now in terms of like

550
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,200
my position here at bug crowd um i'm

551
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
looking at ways to like uplift the

552
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,080
community for all different types of

553
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,360
demographics

554
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,000
um so my question to the panel is how

555
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,880
can we engage

556
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,400
communities in other countries when we

557
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,880
can't travel there um

558
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
i'll pass this to anyone who's

559
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,360
interested in asking

560
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
i'm happy to provide an answer because i

561
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
have thoughts on this

562
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,480
i think when we speak about engaging

563
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:38,960
people

564
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,799
especially from communities that might

565
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,080
not necessarily have

566
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,600
the same amount of voice whether we're

567
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,120
talking about marginalized groups or

568
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,039
even people from other countries

569
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,000
um there's kind of two separate issues

570
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,919
one is this idea of mentorship and

571
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,200
having people

572
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
who can sit down and explain something

573
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,760
to somebody or be someone to look up to

574
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,679
but i think one of the really important

575
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,360
roles that bug crowd

576
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,000
plays really is this idea of sponsorship

577
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,840
this is not my idea this was taught to

578
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,520
me by dawn isabelle

579
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,039
she's amazing but really uplifting those

580
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,080
voices like

581
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
having a conference like level up where

582
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,799
people from different countries speak

583
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,400
from having people from different

584
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,320
communities speaking

585
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
giving people that opportunity to have

586
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,360
their voice heard

587
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,760
and heard kind of across the world is

588
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
like these little ripples of getting

589
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,559
information out there and you know this

590
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,400
is a terrible time for uk people

591
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,080
but someone who's british might watch

592
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,679
this talk see me and

593
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,000
kind of relate to my experiences and

594
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,520
kind of get me

595
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,160
because i use some slang ones um and

596
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,320
they understand that

597
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,039
but um i think it's really important to

598
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,559
provide these kinds of sponsorship

599
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,960
opportunities not just mentorship

600
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,360
absolutely i think there's also some

601
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,640
opportunity to be had

602
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
um just i live in the bay area so i try

603
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
to be really sensitive to the fact that

604
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,000
this is not attainable to everyone and i

605
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
don't think it should need to be

606
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,200
and so seeing things like owasp bay area

607
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
go online and being able to go and just

608
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,360
like

609
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,039
sit in on seattle hacker meetups and

610
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,400
things like that

611
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,679
you know there are limitations of time

612
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,600
zones of course but there's

613
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,520
my hope is that it leads to a little

614
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,640
more kind of

615
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,679
unavoidable democratization of access it

616
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,039
seems like that's starting to happen

617
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,360
um just by you know everything suddenly

618
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,559
being accessible

619
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,840
and i'm hoping that sticks me too

620
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,360
i think that's one really good thing

621
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
that's come out of covid is conferences

622
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
going online

623
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,960
often being free community groups going

624
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,120
online being free to attend

625
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,039
i think that's if anything i really

626
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,000
really hope that part stays

627
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
yeah absolutely i know my two favorite

628
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
things about defcon going into safe mode

629
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,200
this year was one

630
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,280
it's not a hundred thousand degrees and

631
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,400
i'm not sweating

632
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,280
the entire time it's free access and i

633
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
can sit from the comfort of my couch in

634
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,760
my pajamas with my cat and watch it

635
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
so um i know for me that it was nice to

636
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,600
be able to kind of like be in my own

637
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,480
zone

638
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,559
and um be able to like focus on that

639
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,520
networking piece

640
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
um you know what i mean because like

641
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,640
even as katie mentioned

642
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,240
with one of her defront stories like

643
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,360
it's very difficult to engage in that um

644
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,039
that piece of it if you're doing so many

645
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,960
other things um i know brianne came and

646
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
volunteered at our wife's booth last

647
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,600
year

648
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,200
and it was great to see her and it was

649
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,640
great to see all the other volunteers

650
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,840
but it was very difficult to take a

651
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,720
moment and be like

652
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,039
hello how are you doing let's talk what

653
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,080
are you working on

654
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,440
how's it going and then there's the

655
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,200
other piece of all the parties so

656
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,240
um uh how about pharah what do you think

657
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,559
about um how do we engage communities in

658
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,159
other countries when we can't travel

659
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
there right now

660
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,039
i think the fourth step is to just uh

661
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:43,600
create

662
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,559
awareness and let them know that there's

663
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,200
someone

664
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,480
out there who's uh trying to uplift them

665
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,240
because i think uh most of these

666
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,480
communities that we talk about like

667
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,679
that need upliftment take a while to uh

668
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,200
figure out that there's an infosight to

669
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,960
it like there's a community on infosec

670
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,600
twitter

671
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,280
at least for me and i know a lot of

672
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,720
people who don't even know that

673
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,799
a community on twitter like the one we

674
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,080
have exists

675
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,200
so i think uh a step to towards

676
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,720
achieving that could be

677
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,200
trying to be more active on a couple of

678
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,480
different platforms

679
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,600
because um you have to let them know and

680
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,360
then once they do and then i think

681
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,559
that's when you take it forward

682
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,039
yeah absolutely um and i think that's a

683
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,799
good other segue into this other

684
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,840
question which i

685
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,320
i've asked myself um what role should

686
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
companies play in this type of community

687
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,080
development right um

688
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,039
i don't like it when uh brands and

689
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,240
things force themselves

690
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,200
into communities um so i would be

691
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,320
curious for the panel

692
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,400
um what what do you think that companies

693
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,679
should be doing in

694
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,440
in roles in community development do you

695
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,280
think we should be how can we foster

696
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,840
those

697
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,159
connections answering people on twitter

698
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,400
i think a lot of people have you know

699
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,440
these kind of

700
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,039
twitter is a great platform but on

701
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,600
companies you kind of get the two types

702
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,480
of companies

703
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,360
one is relatable memes where you get

704
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,280
brands like sunny delight

705
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,120
tweeting at wendy's and then you have

706
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,840
very corporate but there is a middle

707
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,720
ground

708
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,760
between how do you do fellow kids

709
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,200
and i am a faceless corporation of

710
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,919
interacting like don't be this kind of

711
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,520
person who is on the outside of a

712
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,240
community

713
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,960
engage with it speak to people reply to

714
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,559
what people say don't just say

715
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,720
you can contact our customer support or

716
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,679
dm dms for

717
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,120
customer service it's being that kind of

718
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,080
company that will sometimes tweet memes

719
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,159
but also sometimes tweet

720
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,039
kind of way more like you know whatever

721
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,760
bug crowds

722
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,559
talking about a level up for example so

723
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,000
i think this is getting that right

724
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,880
middle ground

725
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,400
of being in the community but without

726
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,640
kind of going to hello how do you do

727
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
fellow kids

728
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,679
although that is one of my favorite

729
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,720
memes so like don't don't

730
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,159
it's one of my favorite memes as well um

731
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,919
i would love you to you know give

732
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,440
thoughts on the question as well like

733
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,039
what role do you think companies should

734
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,200
play in computer development any at all

735
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,760
maybe

736
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,960
none um yeah i think

737
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,320
that they can um be helpful um

738
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,600
in encouraging people to

739
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,679
you know be part of these events and i

740
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,279
think like what you're doing

741
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,919
here where you know your you're bree as

742
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,480
a person

743
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,799
and you work for bug crowd but you're

744
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,880
also very approachable

745
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,240
and um just having like a dedicated team

746
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,360
that's active in that aspect on social

747
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,440
media to get people

748
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,720
involved is um is really great

749
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,159
yeah i appreciate that thank you um

750
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,880
i'd also love to know like that's that's

751
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,640
super great feedback and i know that we

752
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,039
want to

753
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,039
incorporate those things but um what

754
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,720
types of events and engagement do you

755
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,159
guys want to see during this type of

756
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,279
timeline um

757
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,640
it's very different connecting with

758
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,400
people in virtual spaces like we've said

759
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,120
so are there other types of events or um

760
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,559
engagement opportunities

761
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,480
that you would like to see from maybe

762
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
not just bug crowd but just anyone in

763
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,799
general

764
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,720
uh in this sheltering place timeline

765
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,159
i've been really glad to see more

766
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,480
attempts at trying to sustain the

767
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,080
natural networking that usually happens

768
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,440
when people are in the same room because

769
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,640
that's been one of the things like from

770
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,480
the very beginning especially

771
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,000
once def con announced safe mode and i

772
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
was like oh yeah i'm not going to be in

773
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,960
a room with strangers again

774
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,360
possibly this year and i always got so

775
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,720
much meaning out of that like

776
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,400
kind of despite myself as a pretty hard

777
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,840
introvert

778
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,360
so i've been really interested in seeing

779
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,600
what platforms have brought in to like

780
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,480
make that coffee line experience happen

781
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,679
um

782
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,200
i didn't get to explore it in diana but

783
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,640
there's a the platform they use called

784
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,120
hop in

785
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,320
has like a couple different ways of

786
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,880
doing that and

787
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,159
yeah that's what i'm watching the most

788
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,200
because i think it's the thing that

789
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
could be so easily lost like

790
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,039
those happenstance like i just wound up

791
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,480
in the women's bathroom with four of the

792
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,760
coolest women i've ever met

793
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,440
like i still need that and i'm not

794
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,880
i'm watching for how technology will

795
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,400
enable it things are getting better like

796
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,040
the features are coming out

797
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,200
[Music]

798
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,799
it's so hard too um i know like

799
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,360
i i'm i'm trying to figure out how i can

800
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,880
stay connected with people without

801
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,799
first losing sight of the human element

802
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,360
but also not overwhelming myself

803
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,200
with like over compensating for um

804
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,799
human communication that sounds so

805
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,559
horrible but it is in a way

806
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,880
like i am compensating for that like

807
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,080
loss of human element right um does

808
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,360
anybody else have anything they'd like

809
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
to share on that

810
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,919
so i i don't think many people know this

811
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,960
i'm actually autistic

812
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
in like a face-to-face situation because

813
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,199
i can't read them

814
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,880
like discord or slack has been amazing

815
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,679
for me

816
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,039
because you have sort of a sense of

817
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,320
community especially

818
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,240
when i'm running my own discord i really

819
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,720
feel part of a community

820
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,080
um but also i can ignore it quite easily

821
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,279
when i get overwhelmed

822
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,640
and i think with like covered in shelter

823
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,679
in place then

824
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,120
stay at home to save lives um

825
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,480
some of it has been really good for

826
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,039
people with disabilities to avoid

827
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,320
like stressful situations yeah um

828
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,240
so yeah i think it's good that we're all

829
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,159
kind of doing this new

830
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,919
this new thing and it's really making it

831
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,480
more accessible well

832
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,360
we be able to access it oh yeah totally

833
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,039
um i was gonna say pharah was this your

834
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,279
first defcon this year

835
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,360
yeah actually i this was the first time

836
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,640
i attended defcon

837
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,880
and i think it was online and that's the

838
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,000
only reason i attended

839
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,960
it yeah yeah and i would think that like

840
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
in my mind i'm like oh my god that is so

841
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,480
different than being there in person

842
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,039
because

843
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,799
i've been there with brian and kat and

844
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,640
you know you see the chaos and you see

845
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,919
the like

846
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,360
there's like three different hotels

847
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,960
involved and you have to like travel

848
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,159
over the magic

849
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,480
caesar's bridge and pay tribute to

850
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,320
caesar himself before you get into your

851
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,360
united stand

852
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,120
you know and it's like it's very

853
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,480
confusing and off-putting

854
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,320
but i also felt that the discord was a

855
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
little bit that way so uh

856
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,559
how did you how did you connect did you

857
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,440
connect with people

858
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,360
in safe mode like were you able to

859
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,640
network in uh

860
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,520
the same way you might as a conference

861
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,919
um

862
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,120
no i did not actually but i think

863
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,919
i mean the whole conference looks the

864
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,600
in-person conference sounds

865
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,440
really attractive to me it's like i have

866
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
never experienced it

867
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,279
i'm just waiting for everything over to

868
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,880
be over so that i can just run to my

869
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,399
first conference

870
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,919
oh my gosh you'll have to sign up for

871
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,399
the wisp scholarship plug plug

872
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,639
um

873
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,240
um no that's i mean it is a thing but

874
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,039
also like

875
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,320
would love to have you over for a

876
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,480
conference it's very different um

877
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,399
is there a way that you could have saw

878
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
yourself networking for deathcon sorry

879
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,360
to harp on this so much i'm so

880
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,000
interested in it

881
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,200
um i didn't honestly i when i like saw

882
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,799
defcon i i only like

883
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,039
saw the villagers and the talks part of

884
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,559
it and that's what interested me the

885
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,440
most

886
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,840
i don't think you uh i ever thought

887
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,039
about networking

888
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,520
especially because it was virtual so

889
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,279
networking never really even occurred to

890
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,480
me that much

891
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,159
but i think i get where you're coming

892
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,880
from like you for you defcon has always

893
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,360
been

894
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,320
uh more like like katie said earlier

895
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,799
like

896
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,960
she attended one talk and most of the

897
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
time it was about networking

898
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,679
i think i think i i have never i could

899
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,520
never see it that way as of now

900
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,399
totally um well there's also i know that

901
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:44,720
um

902
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,120
india has nalcon as well and that's a

903
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,200
huge hacking conference and it's been

904
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,960
interesting to see all these conferences

905
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,520
move

906
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,159
uh into that cyber space so there could

907
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,760
be potential there to network as well it

908
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,559
might be different

909
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,760
maybe for more local areas yeah

910
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,559
something to add also um so i know this

911
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,799
has their like tandems program

912
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,000
and um from what i know from

913
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
signing up it's it's been regionalized

914
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,840
so they try to pair you with somebody

915
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,240
that's

916
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,120
in your region um but now that covet is

917
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,679
here and

918
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,399
it's probably never going away um you

919
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,440
know

920
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,440
there's kind of no reason why it has to

921
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,559
be somebody that's

922
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,679
like in the same geographical area as

923
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,760
you that lives anywhere near you so i

924
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,559
guess

925
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,799
i would like to see maybe something like

926
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,240
that where it's the

927
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,440
mentorship buddies system but like

928
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,240
spread across you know the whole globe i

929
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,000
guess you'd have to make time zones work

930
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,279
but

931
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,600
hey just like this we have like three

932
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,960
different time zones going here right

933
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,320
now so we can make it work

934
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,880
yeah um awesome thank you ladies for

935
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,000
answering those questions

936
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,039
um i actually want to jump into the job

937
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,679
searched side of things because we've

938
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,720
kind of talked about community

939
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
development and deafbond in the

940
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,159
networking aspect and a lot of those

941
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,480
things are used to find a job in infosec

942
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,279
amazing um so i was reading a study

943
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:05,919
recently

944
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,480
um there was a survey conducted of 500

945
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,120
cyber security professionals at 284

946
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,480
different companies this was by the

947
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,840
sands institute

948
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,240
and these companies were asked what

949
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,919
skills they find most useful in job

950
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,960
candidates

951
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,279
they found that 85 percent ranked

952
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,360
networking as a critical skill

953
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,840
followed by knowledge of linux windows

954
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,640
common exploits so like oauth top 10

955
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,519
and then data skills were utilized over

956
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,000
programming

957
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,880
skills so all this being said do you

958
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,559
guys agree with this statement would you

959
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,120
say that

960
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,279
certifications or degrees are required

961
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,320
to join infosec

962
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,640
i have a question is that networking as

963
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,360
in like

964
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,399
networking with people or is that like

965
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,080
like never work it was i i had to

966
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,399
clarify um

967
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,760
in the discord later because i thought

968
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,399
the same thing um but it is networking

969
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,880
with your peers as a critical skill

970
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,919
which i mean

971
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,159
honestly kind of does make sense to me

972
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,600
but curious like

973
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,120
cat do you agree with that statement do

974
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,640
you think that that's the most critical

975
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,320
skills over all those other things

976
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,519
um it's it isn't it isn't like i don't

977
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:15,919
want to

978
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,440
discourage anyone from networking

979
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
because you should definitely be focused

980
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,159
on that

981
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,200
as well um i think knowledge of physical

982
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,320
networks is also

983
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,440
super important um let's actually how

984
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,760
we're

985
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,200
gonna answer that question um but

986
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,320
i mean yeah it it is really important

987
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,519
um because you're you can

988
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,320
you know get you can get skills but if

989
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,960
you never

990
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,120
expose yourself to the opportunities

991
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,960
then you're not going to ultimately set

992
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,720
yourself up for the best

993
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,399
success that you can have so yeah i mean

994
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,360
definitely like people skills are

995
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,480
important i think for

996
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,360
a lot of different jobs and infosec is

997
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,000
also one of them

998
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,200
it's funny oh sorry go ahead i was just

999
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,880
gonna say i i totally agree

1000
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,279
i got my most recent job because of

1001
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,399
networking

1002
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,440
i like got a job last week so yay for

1003
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,200
getting a job during covid

1004
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,279
yeah but i i got that job simply because

1005
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,720
i knew the hiring manager and

1006
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,120
he knew me and he knew my work and

1007
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,880
because we had that good rapport

1008
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,440
he could kind of trust me in that

1009
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,919
position

1010
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,919
yeah that list of qualifications is

1011
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,320
basically how i have my job

1012
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,960
from start to finish like i have my job

1013
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,559
because i made a friend at a wisp event

1014
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,840
in 2016.

1015
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
i went to one of the defcon prep events

1016
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
and we

1017
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,200
uh both were in the handcuff competition

1018
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,799
she placed first and i placed second

1019
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,919
and then we realized we'd gone to the

1020
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,000
same code school and we kept in touch

1021
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,080
and then late last year her manager was

1022
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,799
like if only we had an sre interested in

1023
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,279
learning

1024
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,840
security skills and she's like hang on a

1025
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,880
minute

1026
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,519
and that's how this all happened um yeah

1027
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,799
certifications and degrees are

1028
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,000
interesting just coming from a code

1029
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,679
school like we all talk about this very

1030
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,719
intensely

1031
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,560
you know what does it take to come

1032
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,079
across as legitimate what does it take

1033
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,040
to actually

1034
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,320
you know both gain skills and make

1035
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,520
people think you have them which is a

1036
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,800
different thing

1037
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,639
um and because i have an ops background

1038
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,320
i've generally not worked with people

1039
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,918
who have degrees in what they actually

1040
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,520
do so there's kind of a general like ah

1041
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,800
you don't need that

1042
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,839
but generally i found it to be white men

1043
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,199
35 and older who are very well

1044
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,639
established who are like nah you don't

1045
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,480
need that degree i'm like cool

1046
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,520
thank you so much this is useful

1047
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,079
um but it i don't think it's strictly

1048
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,679
necessary but i think if it's the thing

1049
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,119
that lets you

1050
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,040
portray the legitimacy that you want to

1051
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
get to where you want to go

1052
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,159
that's fine that's great it's another

1053
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,000
resource that's available like don't go

1054
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,800
broke

1055
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,159
try to get work to pay for it wherever

1056
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,918
you are right now but

1057
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,560
if that's what it takes cheers go get

1058
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,160
your dreams

1059
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,359
i love that yeah somebody who has

1060
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,560
two degrees or his work has has a

1061
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,320
bachelor's i feel like i should weigh in

1062
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,359
on this

1063
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,640
and defend my my degree um i would say

1064
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,320
one of the most useful things about

1065
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,240
getting my bachelor's degree

1066
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,359
and also my phd as well has been not

1067
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,119
necessarily how much i've learned

1068
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,280
but how many different people i met i've

1069
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,200
met so many people during my degree who

1070
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,119
now do so many different jobs i've met

1071
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,800
people who went into security

1072
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
people who went into mobile apps people

1073
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,000
who went to just regular

1074
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,880
software engineering and all of these

1075
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,960
people have given me opportunities and

1076
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,000
really

1077
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,920
okay new bug bounty hunters because they

1078
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,680
were doing it at university so

1079
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,760
when i got into it i had people i could

1080
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,079
call um and simply just because that was

1081
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,680
a huge networking

1082
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,800
because you're kind of forced to be

1083
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,640
around them for three years and then

1084
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,920
during my phd i

1085
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,119
did a phd because it's something i

1086
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,040
wanted to pursue i want to be a doctor

1087
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,760
because

1088
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,960
quite frankly i want to check that

1089
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
little check box and put doctor in front

1090
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,320
of my name

1091
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,640
but uh for me quite a lot of doing a

1092
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,520
degree

1093
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,839
has been meeting people from tons of

1094
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,280
different backgrounds and really being

1095
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,320
forced

1096
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,680
to socialize with them

1097
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,920
yeah i was going to add to what you're

1098
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
saying about um certs

1099
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,160
is i think that they can definitely make

1100
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,200
you stand out

1101
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,079
if you're on the hunt for a job but i'd

1102
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,599
say that it's more about

1103
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,800
quality than about quantity um so i got

1104
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,599
certified

1105
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,359
um at aws certification a few months ago

1106
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,920
and that's a pretty popular one that's

1107
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,079
been around for a while so i

1108
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,560
think that people will trust and respect

1109
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,359
that

1110
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,160
um but i wouldn't go for just every cert

1111
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,880
that there is

1112
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,400
because um i think ultimately it's

1113
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
you know get the cert as a reflection of

1114
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,599
what you've

1115
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,079
learned but you know don't get it just

1116
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:50,880
to be

1117
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,240
collecting certs on your resume

1118
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,560
totally um this can be for cat and for

1119
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,520
the panel itself

1120
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,240
um are there particular practical skills

1121
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
or certifications that people might want

1122
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,119
to seek

1123
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,040
to make themselves appealing candidates

1124
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,200
um maybe it's not required but something

1125
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,839
you might suggest

1126
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,320
um i think uh programming skills are

1127
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,440
something that can

1128
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,640
uh like an hr or

1129
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,480
some hiring they would really find it

1130
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,760
attractive

1131
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,800
on your resume uh i don't know i

1132
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,520
i probably a lot of people disagree with

1133
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,640
me on this but

1134
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,320
i actually think it could really help

1135
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,839
and um

1136
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,079
about the certifications again i think

1137
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,040
it's great

1138
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,320
um add an hr round to

1139
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,640
get shortlisted for a job or something

1140
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,599
but i don't think

1141
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,400
you should depend on it for uh learning

1142
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,040
any skills

1143
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,520
like depends solely on that let me add

1144
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,119
that

1145
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,640
absolutely um i know for me

1146
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,440
like i have a communications degree and

1147
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
i was working at starbucks before i got

1148
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,880
hired at bug crowd

1149
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,040
so um i was very fortunate to have

1150
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
somebody that i knew that worked at bug

1151
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,040
proud

1152
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,720
and was able to give me a recommendation

1153
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,800
to get in um but i definitely did not

1154
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,839
have any

1155
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,000
infosec skills before i had joined bug

1156
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,280
crowd um and

1157
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,359
of course i've learned a lot i know kat

1158
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,880
has taught me a ton

1159
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,800
we had a technical book club going for a

1160
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,720
while that was fantastic so

1161
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,480
shout out to all my lovely book club

1162
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,839
ladies

1163
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,760
but i definitely feel like there's a lot

1164
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,960
of on the job learning

1165
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,359
and that's super essential every

1166
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,000
business is

1167
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,240
extremely different and i've seen that

1168
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,000
you know i don't know that i would use

1169
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,280
the word required for

1170
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,200
certs and degrees but definitely it

1171
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,400
helps to

1172
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,720
further that understanding or if you

1173
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,240
find that niche area that you're like

1174
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,760
i'm super interested in this i want to

1175
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,440
dive into it a little more

1176
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,560
um and so that's kind of you know i kind

1177
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,160
of sit in the middle of both sides of it

1178
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,800
where i'm like

1179
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,560
yes i love school and i love learning

1180
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,079
and i would totally say

1181
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,599
yes you should pursue that higher

1182
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,440
education if you're able to

1183
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,040
but at the same time i know a lot of

1184
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,640
people who have gotten into the industry

1185
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,400
without having to have that

1186
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,160
so um it kind of depends

1187
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,640
sweet anybody have anything else they'd

1188
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,000
like to add on that

1189
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,800
awesome okay um now that we've kind of

1190
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,599
talked about

1191
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,560
um finding a job in cyber security how

1192
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,000
do you build up your confidence in the

1193
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,560
industry

1194
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,760
once you have that job um so

1195
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,560
i'm gonna ask to the panel um how do you

1196
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,680
how did you guys build up your

1197
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,280
confidence in the industry um

1198
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,920
and have you had imposter syndrome while

1199
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,320
you've been doing it

1200
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,520
um my my strategy is fake it till you

1201
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
make it

1202
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,119
if you look really confident no one can

1203
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,040
actually tell the difference to be

1204
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,599
to be honest uh there's a great meme

1205
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,640
where it's like

1206
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,760
when do i stop pretending never and

1207
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,440
i think that's kind of true i think

1208
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,880
whenever you're

1209
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,480
in a situation where you kind of might

1210
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,640
feel a bit of imposter syndrome

1211
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,240
and you don't really feel confident

1212
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,000
you've got to just project

1213
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,160
whatever confidence you have and then

1214
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,599
eventually you won't be able to tell the

1215
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,880
difference between

1216
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
what was your fake confidence and what

1217
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,560
was your real confidence

1218
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,200
especially when people uh build like

1219
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,960
talk to you and build you up you can sit

1220
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,040
there and really dwell in going

1221
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,119
i'm not this person you think i am you

1222
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,480
think i'm fantastic

1223
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,359
i'm not fantastic i'm bloody terrible at

1224
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,000
all of this

1225
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,160
and you just haven't realized and i

1226
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,839
think what's really important

1227
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,599
is to really take a step back from those

1228
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,599
thoughts and not just

1229
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,280
it's very easy to dwell on them but

1230
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,839
instead set taking a step back and going

1231
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,119
by the data i'm a great person

1232
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,119
um and sometimes you need to give

1233
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,720
yourself a little bit of pep talk and

1234
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
that just a bit of fake confidence

1235
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,839
i'm still faking it

1236
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,440
i love it um i'll ask the same question

1237
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,880
to you farrah um

1238
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,480
how have you built up your confidence so

1239
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,800
far in the industry

1240
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
i could really relate to what katie was

1241
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,400
saying like ever

1242
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,000
it's just like you haven't realized how

1243
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,520
terrible i am like that's that's

1244
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,040
something i really feel

1245
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,319
but i think what i do is um

1246
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,920
i try to not let any external

1247
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,480
uh factor determine that for me and

1248
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,680
whenever i start

1249
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,079
uh developing those feelings i kind of

1250
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,440
just sit with myself

1251
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,560
and think about how far i've come and

1252
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,400
then i don't i don't just mean like huge

1253
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,319
milestones like it doesn't have to be

1254
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,119
a huge milestone it can be a significant

1255
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,319
thing which might be

1256
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,160
considered small but it's important for

1257
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,520
you to realize

1258
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,200
like if you think about your entire path

1259
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,960
from where you started where you are now

1260
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,599
and

1261
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,680
there's been a journey that no one gets

1262
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,200
anything overnight

1263
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,079
i think for me realizing that whenever i

1264
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:44,560
feel

1265
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,720
uh that impostor syndrome i think that

1266
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,599
really helps

1267
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,920
just sitting down with myself and yeah

1268
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,760
and let it letting it come internally

1269
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,400
rather than

1270
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,240
externally absolutely yeah

1271
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,920
um i'll ask the same question to you

1272
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,520
brian um have you built up your

1273
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,280
confidence in the industry or have you

1274
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,920
had to combat imposter syndrome

1275
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,720
oh man i totally have yeah my first tech

1276
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,560
job is in 2015 and i got

1277
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,079
thrown pretty much in the deep end like

1278
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,760
you are now on a government contract

1279
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,280
like

1280
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,240
all right um so i had to get pretty good

1281
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,720
at

1282
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,960
both being able to ask questions that i

1283
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,359
felt a little foolish about but also

1284
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,839
just asserting confidence i don't know

1285
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,440
one of the most useful things that

1286
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,760
i have i actually got before i went into

1287
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,800
tech um

1288
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,440
in 2013 and 2014 i was trying really

1289
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,520
hard to find a different writer's job

1290
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,440
and no one wants to pay writers for

1291
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,040
anything surprise

1292
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,440
so i got really practiced in writing

1293
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
cover letter after cover letter

1294
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,640
and i developed this voice that i

1295
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,480
thought of as the carnival barker which

1296
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,599
was basically just like

1297
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,760
this person is amazing you are super

1298
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,800
stupid if you don't look at this

1299
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,560
person's resume it is astonishing they

1300
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,000
have everything that you want check it

1301
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,119
out and like

1302
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,800
i can kind of summon that at will now

1303
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,720
because i wrote dozens and dozens of

1304
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,359
cover letters in that vein

1305
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,720
i can so relate to that like i have

1306
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,160
my my partner actually calls it my

1307
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
youtube voice where

1308
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,640
i have this voice especially when i go

1309
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,680
into videos

1310
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,880
that i can really project and like

1311
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,359
project this amazing katie who's the

1312
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,040
best person you've ever

1313
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,079
you've ever ever heard of and is amazing

1314
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,800
um and then i'd sort of come down off

1315
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,280
the coffee high and relax a little bit

1316
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,119
but i totally relate to that that whole

1317
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,319
experience

1318
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,160
that's great because i can you know

1319
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,440
maybe you can do this too but i can

1320
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,960
summon it for other people too

1321
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,319
like i offer cover letter writing

1322
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,599
services or just like do you want to

1323
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,720
hear how awesome you are for five

1324
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,319
minutes i'll tell you and you'll be

1325
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,480
it's really convincing i think so just

1326
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,240
let me know

1327
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,960
oh man um i'd love to ask kat the same

1328
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,079
question how have you built up your

1329
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,040
confidence in the industry

1330
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,760
yeah um i so i think it's it's really

1331
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,720
easy to feel like

1332
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,440
an imposter when tech is constantly

1333
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,560
changing

1334
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,240
um you know it changes for everybody

1335
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,480
um and you have to remember that you're

1336
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,160
going to be wrong sometimes

1337
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,240
but you have to kind of just get through

1338
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,760
those experiences because

1339
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,319
everybody has those um so it's really

1340
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,040
like

1341
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,640
others were saying you know finding

1342
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,319
people that are supportive of you

1343
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,680
that you trust like your friends partner

1344
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,160
parents whatever if you trust those

1345
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,440
people and you trust

1346
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,000
their judgment then when they tell you

1347
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,440
that you're awesome

1348
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,040
you should listen to them and that's

1349
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,079
kind of what i do well i think all of

1377
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,200
women in security organizations because

1378
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,640
you inspire me and i appreciate that um

1379
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,319
okay so i want to take a couple of

1380
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,400
questions from our audience and from our

1381
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,280
discord

1382
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,000
and then i have one fun last question

1383
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,359
for everybody that

1384
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,280
has stumped all of my family members for

1385
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,560
some reason

1386
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,960
okay we've got a question from andrew

1387
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,160
mohawk on discord

1388
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,040
and he asks what is a good way to bring

1389
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
more diversity to teams and what should

1390
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,079
organizations do

1391
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,359
in the future to promote it

1392
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,960
i think a lot of people think diversity

1393
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,760
is

1394
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,880
a thing you do diversity is a thing you

1395
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,839
have to do

1396
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,119
to make good things like diverse teams

1397
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,880
build good products they build more

1398
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,400
secure products

1399
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,079
i was at defend con which is a

1400
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,839
conference in seattle

1401
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,400
last year and i listened to this talk

1402
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,079
from someone at facebook who was talking

1403
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,160
about their security issue they had

1404
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,319
with women in india not using profile

1405
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,520
pictures

1406
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,839
and they just didn't understand it

1407
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,760
because their engineers are primarily

1408
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,160
male

1409
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,560
and primarily located in the states they

1410
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,680
didn't understand

1411
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,720
why people in india and specifically

1412
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,880
women would have this huge problem with

1413
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,440
it

1414
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,040
and that really affected the product

1415
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,440
they made because it made it worse

1416
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,760
and they didn't have the solution and i

1417
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,119
think when we think about diversity

1418
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,839
we're thinking okay how do we get people

1419
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,440
involved we should be thinking about it

1420
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,040
in a slightly different way which is if

1421
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,480
we want to make good stuff

1422
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,560
we need a diverse team you can't make

1423
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,680
good things

1424
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,319
without diversity you can't make secure

1425
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,079
products without diversity

1426
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,040
and if you want to support diverse teams

1427
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,760
hire

1428
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,640
diverse people it's not actually that

1429
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,480
difficult to hire a woman

1430
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,760
i promise don't just look

1431
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,480
for what we might consider kind of

1432
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,520
typical roles

1433
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,200
i think people here really demonstrate

1434
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,960
that actually there's no

1435
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,880
person that goes into infosec there's

1436
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,040
tons of different ways to go

1437
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,839
into this industry and really um find a

1438
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:20,319
job

1439
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,720
in in infosec just hire them

1440
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,920
absolutely the thing i always think of

1441
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,640
is that

1442
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,160
whenever i hear a company start talking

1443
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,760
about diversity i want to tell them that

1444
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,040
they need to have their house in order

1445
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,359
first

1446
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,000
it's and it's hard like i don't have a

1447
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,160
great prescribed way to do this

1448
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,800
or else i'd be much richer um but the

1449
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,400
thing that i think of is

1450
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,440
when i started my job in 2018 i forget

1451
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,280
how this came up but i was talking to

1452
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,880
the other younger engineer on my team

1453
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,559
and i had

1454
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,960
i got to be the one to inform him that

1455
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,680
any

1456
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,599
woman engineer or like not cis male

1457
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,680
engineer is probably at most

1458
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,920
three social degrees removed from all of

1459
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,599
the rest of them

1460
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,000
and i just i leaned over and i was like

1461
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,640
we talk to each other a lot

1462
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,800
we all share information it keeps us out

1463
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,240
of cesspools

1464
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,960
and he looked so shocked like i was like

1465
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,160
don't you you're cool don't worry i'm

1466
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,599
not telling anyone anything about you

1467
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,640
keep it up good job but

1468
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,839
that's the thing i keep thinking of is

1469
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,839
like oh we just need to you know i would

1470
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,520
like to purchase one diversity please

1471
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:25,839
like

1472
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,359
no you have to make sure that there's

1473
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,440
not a little locus of

1474
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,440
rot in your organization because

1475
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,800
otherwise someone will come in and go

1476
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,520
like oh

1477
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,359
no thank you and go right back out the

1478
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,839
front door i've seen it happen

1479
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,000
and so i think that the thing that often

1480
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,200
doesn't happen is the foundation that

1481
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,480
gets built by having

1482
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,960
difficult conversations and also making

1483
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,760
a

1484
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,760
culture of psychological safety which i

1485
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,599
bang on a lot about

1486
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,160
um because without that you can do you

1487
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,800
know you can

1488
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,720
host events and you can donate to things

1489
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,480
and you can do all sorts of stuff but

1490
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,319
your house is still decaying and people

1491
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,040
will know because it stinks

1492
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,800
i think that gets lost in the discussion

1493
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,079
sometimes is that

1494
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,520
we're not necessarily talking about

1495
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,440
getting women into security

1496
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,680
we're really asking why aren't women

1497
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,200
staying in security and not just

1498
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,480
remember other diverse

1499
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,800
groups as well and i think often that

1500
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,720
question that you're asking

1501
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,200
gets lost in like okay let's just teach

1502
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,800
bunch of people security

1503
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,880
but actually if the jobs they're going

1504
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,800
into aren't going to support them and

1505
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,960
it might in fact make things worse for

1506
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,359
them why bother staying just go take

1507
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,240
your skills elsewhere

1508
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,280
absolutely um and i know that internally

1509
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,880
for bug crowd we have the she

1510
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,880
organization that's happening right now

1511
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,280
um that was founded pretty recently and

1512
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,240
and before that

1513
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,960
um you know we we definitely had some

1514
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,559
things that we were working towards but

1515
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,040
for me

1516
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,280
it was networking internally with that

1517
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,319
with the women that were

1518
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,240
in our company because there were not

1519
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,440
that many and so

1520
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,119
you know us coming together as technical

1521
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,880
women and having that support system

1522
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,440
with a technical book club i mean was

1523
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,720
everything and more

1524
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,359
in terms of like the support i needed to

1525
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:03,760
feel

1526
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,079
to feel like i could be part of this

1527
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,640
organization i could be part of this

1528
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,240
community and feel like there was some

1529
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,599
diversity and inclusion that was

1530
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:12,160
happening

1531
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,720
so um i know that like i i've really

1532
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,079
enjoyed that um

1533
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,559
and and cat what kind of things are is

1534
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:19,520
she working on

1535
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,040
um as the organ you know the

1536
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,480
organization of she for bug crowd

1537
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,119
yeah so we're kind of coming at it from

1538
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,000
a lot of different

1539
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,160
angles um she is an organization

1540
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,200
that is um it's not just a group of

1541
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,760
women

1542
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,960
it's a group for women so we're working

1543
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,680
with

1544
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,640
people at all levels of the organization

1545
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,200
from

1546
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,599
the executive team to individual

1547
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,280
contributors who are

1548
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,640
really new at the company to

1549
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,839
talk about these issues we've done

1550
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:54,559
panels

1551
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,440
with um about imposter syndrome we've

1552
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,920
done

1553
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,359
networking um we've had discussions

1554
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,960
about diversity

1555
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,960
and um so i think you need like a

1556
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,319
multi-faceted approach

1557
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,800
um you need to think about it the

1558
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,839
earlier the better

1559
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,599
obviously and you really have to

1560
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,040
get on the leadership at your company to

1561
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,920
have those conversations with them and

1562
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,000
if it's really important to them

1563
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,880
um and if it's not just lip service they

1564
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,160
will put resources

1565
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,720
behind it um and then you know what

1566
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,599
others were saying

1567
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,240
it's not just about going and finding a

1568
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,319
bunch of um

1569
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,040
junior engineers who are from

1570
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,559
underrepresented groups

1571
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,920
and hiring them because

1572
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,000
um like bran said you know if your

1573
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,280
culture is not great they're not going

1574
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,319
to stay

1575
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,359
you have to really look at like are

1576
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,160
women being promoted at the same rate or

1577
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,000
you know whatever it is that's just a

1578
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,359
simple example

1579
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,640
um so then it becomes you know

1580
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,240
how are we mentoring our employees um

1581
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,599
how are we building them up um

1582
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,880
those sorts of things absolutely um

1583
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,640
okay i'm gonna actually shift to one

1584
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,319
more question from the audience

1585
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,240
we have another question from discord

1586
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,720
which is what challenges or changes have

1587
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,960
you faced specifically in your sector

1588
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,839
since the start of proven 19 um what

1589
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,520
kind of changes do you anticipate to

1590
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,240
continue

1591
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,920
um let's go with farah um did you have a

1592
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,960
difficult time

1593
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,559
uh you just recently started a new

1594
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,400
position right

1595
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
yeah what was it like trying to find

1596
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,480
that job and connect during the time of

1597
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,319
covid

1598
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,079
um so actually i found i i was doing

1599
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,240
internships right before this and

1600
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,880
uh around january like kind of on the

1601
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,079
pandemic uh

1602
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,960
you could see it coming i found myself

1603
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,800
like without a job and internship and i

1604
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,760
was trying to

1605
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,680
apply everywhere and like i was finding

1606
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,119
no luck and

1607
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,520
i think uh that's when i got into bug

1608
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,280
bounties because it seemed like

1609
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,079
a good gig economy model and also i

1610
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,599
thought i would learn a lot along the

1611
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,160
way

1612
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,960
so i think the co like the pandemic has

1613
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,440
had

1614
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,720
a very positive effect on me and i i

1615
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,880
feel like i'm thriving in the pandemic

1616
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,280
so

1617
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,240
i think it's great and i think i got

1618
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,520
this job because

1619
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,559
i mean of like bug bounty and because of

1620
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,040
networking on linkedin so i think that's

1621
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,599
something that really helped

1622
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,200
absolutely and katie same question to

1623
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,960
you you just got a new uh position as

1624
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,200
well did you do remote interviews was it

1625
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,800
was it different than you would have

1626
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,200
expected with because of koga

1627
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,200
so one thing to note is my new job is an

1628
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,400
academic job it's

1629
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,240
teaching cyber security at our

1630
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,520
university

1631
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,640
it's important caveat um so

1632
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,800
my job at the moment like my actual

1633
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,240
because be doing a phd if you didn't

1634
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,160
know it's basically a full-time job you

1635
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,640
do

1636
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,640
a piece of research nine to five five

1637
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,680
days a week

1638
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,880
um so i'm in the thesis part of my work

1639
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,880
so the whole work from home i got told

1640
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,000
you're probably not gonna come back in

1641
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,440
the office before you graduate and i was

1642
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,319
like

1643
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,559
can i have my laptop on my screen please

1644
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,079
and i'll be fine

1645
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,880
um but then when i was interviewing it

1646
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,960
really helped because

1647
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,960
you know what i run a youtube channel

1648
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,200
where i deliver virtual lectures

1649
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,960
to students around the world from

1650
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,559
different age groups because that's what

1651
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,480
my videos are they're lectures

1652
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,040
uh sorry i fooled all of my viewers who

1653
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:27,760
are watching

1654
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,280
you've actually been learning while

1655
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,040
you're watching my videos

1656
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,640
um so i could point at that and go look

1657
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,520
here's my teaching you can see it you

1658
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,040
can see how i present

1659
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,799
you can see the kinds of slides i make

1660
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,119
you can see how i interact

1661
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,040
uh with my audience and how i meet their

1662
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,400
demands and then

1663
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,680
also i kind of make like i don't know

1664
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,000
you have uh in lecturing you have

1665
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,200
learning objectives

1666
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,359
all of my videos actually have learning

1667
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,280
objectives associated with them

1668
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,280
um i have an idea of what people should

1669
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,680
learn so i was doing all of this

1670
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,200
and i got feedback from my interview

1671
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,720
actually only this week and they were

1672
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,920
like you know we found the most

1673
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,680
impressive thing about you was the fact

1674
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,960
you run a youtube channel

1675
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,119
and um the fact you've gained all of

1676
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,799
these views all in your free time that

1677
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,720
was really impressive

1678
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,200
and then from twitter tiffany long who

1679
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,160
runs the mentoring

1680
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,400
or ran the mentoring program that i was

1681
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,599
originally part of

1682
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,079
said often in this kind of economy you

1683
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,920
have to do the job

1684
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,400
um that you your dream job before you

1685
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,920
even apply for it

1686
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,000
and that's what i did and then that got

1687
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,680
me basically my dream job

1688
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,720
so it's been kind of amazing to show

1689
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,640
hey you know what next year all

1690
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,920
university courses are going to be

1691
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,720
virtual

1692
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,000
but guess who knows how to make a video

1693
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,880
i do got him i love that oh my gosh

1694
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,000
yeah that's fantastic and uh such an

1695
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,920
interesting take especially with kobet

1696
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,280
you know like

1697
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,040
it really didn't affect that but at the

1698
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,559
same time like you were doing remote

1699
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,640
things you know

1700
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,599
it's been like incredible to be able to

1701
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:06,480
kind of

1702
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,799
accidentally find myself in a very

1703
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,119
favorable position but i'll take it

1704
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,200
because it's covered the economy is kind

1705
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,160
of collapsing

1706
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,000
i'll take any help i can get i'm not

1707
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,160

1708
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,160

1709
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,359

1710
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,400

1711
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,200
to everybody

1712
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,440

1713
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,960
would love if you could shout out

1714

your phone

1720
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,559
except for three applications now what

1721
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,240
tripped my family up was like

1722
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,240
anything that's on there already is fine

1723
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,920
like you're you're texting you're

1724
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,520
calling that's all good like

1725
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,119
you gotta keep that's the main function

1726
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,440
of the phone but if you had to keep

1727
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,440
three apps only from your phone what

1728
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,440

now because it's been an interesting

1737
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,520
season

1738
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,480
um the only three i would keep uh let's

1739
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:14,880
see

1740
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,160
words with friends uh feedly and you

1741
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,400
need a budget

1742
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,720
good one all right on to farah if you

1743
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,240
had to delete everything but three apps

1744
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,280
from your phone what would you keep

1745
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,000
um all right so first you can find me on

1746
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,720

if i could keep only three apps i think

1751

to say i'm finally googlable

1766
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,880
inside a phd now that's not inside

1767
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,160
a phd that's insider as an insider

1768
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,040
threat

1769
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,319
um and that's not inside a php but

1770
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,280
phd as in they had academic

1771
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,799
qualification

1772
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:30,240
it gets mixed up a lot um and you can

1773
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,079
you can find me on twitter and youtube

1774
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,359
you just search for me um so the three

1775
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,720
applications i would keep

1776
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,240
uh one is my medication alarm because

1777
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,200
if i didn't have it i would literally be

1778
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,480
dead because i just wouldn't take my

1779
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,760
medication

1780
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,799
um very important to staying alive uh

1781
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:49,680
the next one

1782
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,400
would be omnifocus if you don't know

1783
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,400
what omnifocus is

1784
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,440
it is the ultimate to-do list

1785
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,000
it is like a supercharged to-do list

1786
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,880
it's amazing

1787
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,319
it's incredible i i i would give them

1788
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,359
all of my money

1789
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,400
um and then my third choice

1790
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,160
is it's gonna have to be a calendar

1791
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,720
i don't function well without a calendar

1792
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,000
i wouldn't attend

1793
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
anything without my calendar so i'm

1794
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
keeping it

1795
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,960
love it um all right and uh last but of

1796
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,319
course not least kat

1797
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,920
what are the three apps from your phone

1798
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,599
you're keeping and where can we find you

1799
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,359
online

1800
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,400
um yeah you can find me on twitter it's

1801
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,680
not cat with a zero instead of an o so

1802
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,960
n zero t k a t um i don't

1803
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,640
use it that much though i'm not really

1804
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,640
that big on social

1805
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,599
um and the three apps that i would keep

1806
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,520
i would have to say

1807
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,559
um i used signal uh

1808
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,040
to communicate with various friends of

1809
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:55,680
mine

1810
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,240
um solely so i would probably want to

1811
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,920
keep that one

1812
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,960
i have this app from privacy.com

1813
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,440
that i use for pretty much every time i

1814
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,520
make a purchase online

1815
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,000
and it just auto-generates credit card

1816
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,680
numbers for you

1817
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,839
so i find that really really useful

1818
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:20,079
it's called privacy.com next

1819
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,599
yeah um and then the third one

1820
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,839
yeah probably also my google calendar

1821
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:26,720
has been

1822
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,760
super useful just during this pandemic

1823
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,119
planning things and having a

1824
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,880
tangible schedule for my life

1825
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,640
nice those are good um okay for me

1826
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,200
it would be twitter also i'm with you

1827
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,040
farah i love twitter i can't get enough

1828
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:45,599
of it

1829
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,480
how am i gonna get my 21 pilots fandom

1830
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,319
knowledge

1831
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:53,599
um i'm gonna roast myself on that one

1832
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,720
then spotify is another one i use it

1833
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,000
religiously every single day

1834
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,920
