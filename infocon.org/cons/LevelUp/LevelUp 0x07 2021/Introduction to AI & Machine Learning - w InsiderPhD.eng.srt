[Music]

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,759
um but yeah without further ado let's

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,839
introduce the next speaker katie so for

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,119
those of you who don't know

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,199
katie is a bug bounty hunter educational

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,480
youtuber and

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,480
is somehow finding the time to finish

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
her phd in cyber security and machine

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:24,880
learning

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,640
a former data scientist turned cyber

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
security person who's been in

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,800
bug hunting until 2019 that's her bio um

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,238
today katie's going to be talking with

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,520
us about

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,760
an intro to ai for bug bounty hunters

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,640
which i'm

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,559
super jazzed for this talk i think this

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,000
is going to be super

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,480
super informative and exciting um not

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,120
for the

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,640
for the least of the reasons to actually

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,160
understand what ai

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,399
means and is hopefully by the end of it

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,160
so take it away katie

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,039
well thank you for having me today i'm

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,199
really going to be talking about

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,840
several different topics but i hope

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,280
you'll come away from this entire

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,480
introduction

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,840
thinking i kind of understand this a

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,640
little bit better

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,880
ai and machine learning as a field moves

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,560
really quickly

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
um and sometimes actually quite slowly

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,159
and there's a lot of terms so i really

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,439
hope by the end of this presentation

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,720
you'll maybe understand a little bit

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,439
more

39
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,759
um so i should start by introducing

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,960
myself again

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,680
um my name is katie i call myself an

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,280
occasional bug bounty hunter

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,759
because i don't always have the time to

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,400
do it

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,360
part-time um but i'm part-time a cyber

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
security youtuber i make videos on bug

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,720
hunting on youtube

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,240
um but that's kind of what i'm well

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
known for but actually i also have a day

50
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,040
job

51
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,240
i'm a phd student and my phd is in

52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,840
cyber security machine learning i have a

53
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
bachelor's in computer science

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,799
when i finished my bachelor's i ended up

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,640
working as a data scientist now you

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,040
don't really know what data scientist is

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,680
it's kind of like the software engineer

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,439
for things like machine learning but

59
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,040
also a bunch of other things

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,920
my like job in machine learning was not

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
actually that interesting

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,479
um i did kind of got a bunch of sales

63
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,560
data and worked out which sales person

64
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,200
would sell

65
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,399
what day to the best um sounds really

66
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,440
boring

67
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,080
was kind of boring that's why i'm a phd

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,360
student now

69
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,640
um so we really want to start with one

70
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,760
key question

71
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,239
which is what is ai and i'm going to

72
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:22,879
tell you

73
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,560
probably everything you might have ever

74
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
wanted to know about ai

75
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,879
um but let's start with the big question

76
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,840
what is ai

77
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,280
and i think this is a really great way

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
to explain what ai is is this kind of

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,160
ever increasing like

80
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,879
circle we start with ai which is this

81
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,360
general concept or a program that can

82
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,400
sense reason act adapt we think about a

83
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,440
machine that can act like a human

84
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
then we have machine learning where we

85
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
have algorithms that are specifically

86
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,959
designed to improve their performance

87
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,879
when they're exposed to more data

88
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,480
and then we have deep learning which is

89
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
about uh neural networks

90
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,080
um but if you're not really familiar

91
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
with these terms you probably don't

92
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,800
really understand them

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,519
so i've created this in memes now our

94
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,800
big ai

95
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,440
is if statements so this is quite a big

96
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,239
mean that all ai is just if statements

97
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,319
um then we have machine learning which

98
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,040
is just statistics that we rebranded as

99
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,920
machine learning

100
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,440
so statisticians um would get upset

101
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,599
and then we have deep learning which is

102
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,879
really importing

103
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,799
a program called tensorflow into your

104
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,360
code and making it do all the hard work

105
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,519
while you sit back and do machine

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,120
learning research

107
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,400
so this is a bit tongue-in-cheek

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
because it's not always if statements

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,879
some of the time so ai is this gigantic

110
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,560
field but it includes a bunch of other

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,680
things as well

112
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,519
so we have machine learning which is

113
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,280
kind of separated into supervised and

114
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,239
unsupervised

115
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,319
don't worry we'll cover that um then we

116
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,840
have natural language processing which

117
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,560
is what i do

118
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,040
my phd which is all about kind of

119
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,159
statistical analysis

120
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,640
of text and human language we have

121
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,000
computer vision

122
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
that's you know the self-driving cars

123
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,599
that can see if something's a human

124
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,280
or a dog or a stop light whatever

125
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,319
um but also those memes where you see

126
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,478
like why is my machine learning

127
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,040
algorithm recognizing the dog as a cat

128
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600
that kind of thing and we also have our

129
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
if statement so robotics manufacturing

130
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,600
optimization

131
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
um which might kind of look like machine

132
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,440
learning that is this statement

133
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
most of the time if statements all the

134
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,360
way down

135
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
and it's not always a stuffer nightmare

136
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,720
so this is a

137
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,840
neural network um and it's designed to

138
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,240
kind of replicate how your brain works

139
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,919
apart from it doesn't do that

140
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,840
it just gives you nightmares of these

141
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
kind of like inner layers which will

142
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,040
have all these neurons that connect

143
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
now i'm going to reassure you here

144
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,720
machine learning

145
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,199
is just statistics if you have a ball a

146
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,639
flat a bag of balls

147
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,400
and if i pull out three red balls and

148
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,479
one green ball the probability of the

149
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,320
next ball being red is three out of four

150
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,240
and being green is one out of four

151
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
now this doesn't really matter because

152
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
it could be that the next

153
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,000
all the other balls that says temples in

154
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,680
the bag the rest of them

155
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,600
are also green so

156
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
we really can see that the probability

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,919
of it being

158
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,840
green might be one out of four based on

159
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
what we've seen but actually

160
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,120
the statistics might not tell us the

161
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,479
full story

162
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,919
um and from this we kind of make a

163
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,720
prediction

164
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,199
that a red bull is most likely it could

165
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,880
be the rest of the balls of green

166
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,680
however a red ball is more likely and

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,199
this is primarily what ai

168
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,680
is doing under the hood um it may look

169
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,000
like ai is doing all these

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,320
clever things but really under the hood

171
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,919
ai is just

172
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,160
looking at these statistics and kind of

173
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,840
making predictions based on what it's

174
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
already seen

175
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
unfortunately machine learning is just

176
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
statistics

177
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,720
and the field of statistics has moved on

178
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,319
since you did kind of

179
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,800
maybe grade school level stats uh where

180
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
we're talking about balls

181
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,360
and bags and no joke this is actually an

182
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,880
algorithm

183
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,440
that i had to look at for my phd and i

184
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
had to explain those like i'll just

185
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
get off on wikipedia how does it work i

186
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,319
looked at this and thought

187
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,160
okay for further information on this

188
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,520
algorithm please see

189
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,880
paper name yeah because i'm not going to

190
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,919
touch that

191
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,840
uh and often in machine learning the

192
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,120
math kind of looks

193
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
much closer to this um we're not math

194
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,800
people this looks confusing there are

195
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,639
like greek letters in there

196
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,199
no um we're not really looking at

197
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,800
improving the algorithms and we really

198
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
don't need to know all this

199
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,759
we really only need to know the kind of

200
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,759
what the algorithm does and how it does

201
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,120
it

202
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
so what is the core of machine learning

203
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,400
now there's two kind of key concepts

204
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
here one is

205
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,520
training a statistical model a bunch of

206
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,240
data and then using that model to make

207
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,160
predictions about new data using what is

208
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,520
previously seen

209
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
to make predictions about new data

210
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,400
and that is all machine learning is like

211
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,960
everything you see from computer vision

212
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,680
to

213
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,560
self-driving cars to what might be the

214
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,800
next bug hunting machine learning

215
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,479
uh model it's all going to be data

216
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,039
model prediction it's not going to be

217
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,520
any more complex than that i promise

218
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,800
so i've told you about the statistics um

219
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
and i told you that's not really what it

220
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
looks like so

221
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
let's have a chat about practical

222
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,440
machine

223
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,360
learning um so

224
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,199
i'm kind of skipping over here the other

225
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,879
types of ai i'm focusing on machine

226
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,240
learning because it's one of the easiest

227
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,319
to explain it's where most people start

228
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,000
um and machine learning can kind of be

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,879
broken down into how the algorithms work

230
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,800
and that supervised unsupervised

231
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,080
reinforcement that's what i call

232
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,599
semi-supervised

233
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,080
now that doesn't mean that they need a

234
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,440
programmer watching over

235
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
the like algorithm at all time what it

236
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
means is that the data has labels

237
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,039
associated with it

238
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,479
for certain like supervised machine

239
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,759
learning i'm going to give you a bunch

240
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,520
of data and give you the label so that

241
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,000
might mean

242
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
i give you a bunch of photos and i tell

243
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
you this is a duck

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,759
this is a duck this is a duck this is

245
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,879
not a duck and then i ask you to predict

246
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,879
which one is a duck uh a new a new image

247
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,560
and then unsupervised is where i give

248
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
you a bunch of pictures don't give you

249
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
any other information and just tell you

250
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,279
sort them out reinforcement learning is

251
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,958
a little bit different

252
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,320
um and it's primarily used in kind of

253
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,958
different

254
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,880
fields but i'll explain that a little

255
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,719
bit more as we get to it

256
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,320
um but it's the idea of rewarding

257
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,080
a algorithm um when a model works really

258
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,640
well

259
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,839
and these are all used to solve

260
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,360
different problems i really like this

261
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,000
graph over

262
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,040
here because i think it does a great job

263
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,920
of kind of highlighting it so we have in

264
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
unsupervised learning we have clustering

265
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,080
we have recommender systems so that's

266
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
when amazon tells you a bunch of

267
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
products you don't want

268
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
customer segmentations that's when you

269
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,279
kind of look at a bunch of customers

270
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,600
inside which categories they go into

271
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,279
over in supervised we have image

272
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,120
classification

273
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,560
and over in reinforcement learning we

274
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
have game ai

275
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
um so they're used to solve different

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,839
problems so i want to just go into sort

277
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,160
of

278
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,640
more detail on what these look like so

279
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,600
this is

280
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
supervised machine learning now we give

281
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,279
a

282
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,080
bunch of pictures that have labels and

283
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
we ask it

284
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,560
new image tell me what it is and this is

285
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,320
one of the simplest forms of machine

286
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
learning you tend to see

287
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,320
a lot of kind of complex machine

288
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
learning is built from these um

289
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,080
uh statistical like supervised learning

290
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,720
models the problem is is that as you can

291
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,680
imagine you need

292
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
a lot of data to make machine learning

293
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,600
work very well

294
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
and not just that you need a lot of

295
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,720
label data

296
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,200
and humans have to make those labels you

297
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,880
can't get a machine to make

298
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
labels for you really and it won't be

299
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,040
accurate if you do

300
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,399
so not only is there just like

301
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,480
the whole getting all the data you have

302
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,839
to label the data it's

303
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
quite labor intensive to do supervised

304
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,160
machine learning

305
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,519
um but it works great for classification

306
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,680
problems so when you have

307
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
like what in what is this is this a cat

308
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,200
or a dog is this a duck or a not a duck

309
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,560
so that's the first kind of easy kind of

310
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,279
beginner stuff we then have unsupervised

311
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,160
machine learning

312
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,079
now as for supervised machine learning

313
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,480
where we had a bunch of data

314
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,839
labels associated with each piece of

315
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,800
data with unsupervised machine learning

316
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,000
um we have the opposite we just have

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,320
data and we ask the machine to figure it

318
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,440
out for itself

319
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,279
now the way it does this is quite

320
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,040
interesting algorithmically i won't kind

321
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,160
of go into that

322
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,480
but it tries to draw these boundaries

323
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
between where the data might be

324
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,200
you tell it how many clusters it needs

325
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,720
so in this case we've asked

326
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,560
the algorithm to take this data and turn

327
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
it into three clusters

328
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
and it kind of decides where those

329
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,000
boundaries might be between the data

330
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,040
now this is really useful and this is

331
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,279
like what i do during my phd as well

332
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,160
because this

333
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,839
is not very labor intensive

334
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,519
comparatively anyway

335
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,399
you just give it data and you just see

336
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,279
what it figures out on its own

337
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,920
um it's only really can be used to solve

338
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
some problems though and

339
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
what it's good for is really going to be

340
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,200
dependent on what problems you have

341
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,399
um very very good for clustering data

342
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,360
kind of a good security example might be

343
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,920
um

344
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,399
i have a bunch of bugs tell me which

345
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,320
bugs have some kind of relationship

346
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
you know tell me which where sql

347
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,040
injection is related to blind sql

348
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
injection for example which is related

349
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
to whatever

350
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
and then we have reinforcement learning

351
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
and this is my favorite example and i

352
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,680
don't know if you've seen this this came

353
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,200
this was quite popular uh

354
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,000
a few months ago and it was on the bbc

355
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
um

356
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,360
and what this is is it's got it's a

357
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,800
skeleton that's held some rules

358
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,120
associated with it with how it can move

359
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,760
and it learns to walk and jump and run

360
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,360
in a very strange way

361
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,279
because what happens is the algorithm

362
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,480
gets rewarded the further it can make it

363
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,519
so it just basically hits random buttons

364
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,320
until it makes it further then it tries

365
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,000
to almost mutate that

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,519
so that's kind of very similar to what

367
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,600
we might consider as evolution

368
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,560
um but not as we know it like it's very

369
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,920
different

370
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,480
it's kind of like watching it play all

371
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,040
the game

372
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,800
q q up a few years ago where you have

373
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,000
like runner and you have to hit the

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,279
buttons and you just end up hitting them

375
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,360
randomly

376
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,800
so we know the algorithms now how do we

377
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,839
actually

378
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,000
train them uh so once we decide an

379
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,079
approach we need to change the algorithm

380
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,079
which seems simple enough you think one

381
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,560
line of code

382
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,600
model.train put your data in sorted

383
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,800
actually the actual stages of going from

384
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,519
data to machine learning model is quite

385
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,560
difficult there's

386
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
loads of stages and in each stage you

387
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,399
kind of

388
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,160
it really does impact the performance of

389
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,920
the model later on so it's really

390
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,360
important to make sure you get it right

391
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,959
and how to kind of have this iterative

392
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,920
process

393
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
um so some of the stages you typically

394
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,720
see splitting the data into a test and a

395
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
train set i'll explain that a sec

396
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
selecting which features are the most

397
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
important so that means you know

398
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,959
what part of a duck makes something a

399
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,079
duck

400
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,639
um and then evaluating the model does it

401
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,720
work well what's the accuracy like now

402
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,920
accuracy when it comes to machine

403
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,040
learning

404
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,360
i'm going to use it very generally i am

405
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,240
aware that it

406
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,399
it there are measures of accuracy and

407
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,000
there's loads of different types

408
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,240
i'm going to cover that that's fine um

409
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,760
so let's talk about splitting the data

410
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,079
so

411
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,000
when we have developed these machine

412
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,199
learning models

413
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,839
we have our training but we also

414
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,600
have to have some way of seeing if it

415
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,320
works

416
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,160
and then primarily like the way we do

417
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,320
that is we take our big data set

418
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,320
and we just go 80 of data will be used

419
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,399
for the training of the machine learning

420
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,079
and twenty percent will be used for

421
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,399
testing later there's a big advantage of

422
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:22,720
this

423
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,680
that because say for classification we

424
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,079
know what labels are associated with

425
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,079
we can kind of see you know we can tune

426
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,839
the model a little bit change some

427
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,279
hyper parameters which like hidden

428
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,279
parameters in the model

429
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,959
and then make some small adjustments

430
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,880
does it work well whatever

431
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,760
and then uh for some you might have not

432
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,839
just a training a test set but also a

433
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,199
validation set

434
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,839
so you might be starting with say 100

435
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,800
records

436
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,240
by the time you do this you might be

437
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
only looking at 60 records

438
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,839
that you can actually train your machine

439
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,160
learning model on so you end up like

440
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,360
slashing the data continually just to

441
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,079
try and get something that you can test

442
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,240
and you can validate and you can see if

443
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
it works

444
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,199
a feature selection is next so feature

445
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,880
selection is all about

446
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,880
what makes that piece of data that class

447
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,639
because we might look at a duck and

448
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,480
compare it to a cow and go

449
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,279
well a duck has feathers but actually

450
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,880
all birds have feathers that's not

451
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,040
really something that's special to ducks

452
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
it's just all birds have feathers

453
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,720
you go oh well it has a beak and its

454
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,920
face is green

455
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,120
and then you go well you know do it does

456
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
other things have green faces

457
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,360
so when you do this kind of process

458
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
you're really trying to pick out what is

459
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
the most important features that will

460
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,240
lead to the best

461
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,800
um classification overall because if you

462
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,279
include

463
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,360
everything you go well i'm just going to

464
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,800
trade on everything

465
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
what you'll get is something that takes

466
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
ages to run and that won't give you any

467
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,639
good results it will just return garbage

468
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,680
so we've got that

469
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,560
we then we've got evaluating the models

470
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,160
and there are so many different

471
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,880
mathematical ways of evaluating models

472
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,399
um there is tables of accuracy there's

473
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,079
for different algorithms there's

474
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,959
different ways of looking at things

475
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,519
there's heuristics there's precision

476
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,240
recall

477
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,759
there's r square there are so many ways

478
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,480
of like

479
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,399
quantifying if something works

480
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,880
and actually this can take a really long

481
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,680
time

482
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,800
because you have to figure out when you

483
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,560
act when you're actually okay with your

484
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,240
model being bad

485
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,880
um because you won't get 100 accuracy

486
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,480
you may not even get 90

487
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
when you first start out it's working

488
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
out kind of the best

489
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,480
combination best recipe of data plus

490
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,519
hyper parameters plus the test and

491
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
training sets

492
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,279
plus whatever that ends up giving you

493
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,680
the best model possible

494
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,480
um and with that comes errors and one of

495
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,079
the biggest errors we see in machine

496
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,679
learning is bias

497
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,359
any machine learning system is going to

498
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,039
be biased towards the data it was

499
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,319
trained on

500
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,599
um and often the data comes in biased so

501
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,039
for example um gpt-3

502
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,359
can't give you a sentence about muslims

503
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,559
without it being about

504
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,160
violence um apple's credit card system

505
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
was discriminating against women um tay

506
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,840
tweets which was this famous

507
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,000
kind of experiment set up by microsoft

508
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
people tweeted out racist things to the

509
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,720
robot and the robot tweeted out racist

510
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
things back it learned from what people

511
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,919
were tweeting at it

512
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,120
um when you give a uh

513
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,679
image classification system pictures of

514
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,880
people cooking

515
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,640
it often assumes they're women because

516
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,840
it's seen more women cooking

517
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,799
on youtube if you post content that's

518
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,480
lgbt

519
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,320
you're likely to get demonetized and

520
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,640
we kind of wave this away as garbage in

521
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,520
garbage out

522
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,679
it's really important to know what the

523
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,039
data is trained on and how that's

524
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,960
actually going to affect the model

525
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,640
because you know these are really

526
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,559
extreme examples that are quite well

527
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,600
publicized

528
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,679
but if you've got a model that's only

529
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,280
slightly biased

530
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,039
you're going to have similar problems

531
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,039
you're going to have errors

532
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,960
and you're not going to be able to

533
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,799
really fix them

534
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,919
not in the same way you can fix code so

535
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,360
it's really important when we think

536
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,039
about errors to also think about

537
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,000
what you've actually fed the model um

538
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,559
and

539
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,000
what data it's got so

540
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,320
that's a very very quick introduction to

541
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,520
uh machine learning um and

542
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,720
kind of some of the relevant issues um

543
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,840
and if you really

544
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
if you listen to this part of my talk

545
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,120
and you go

546
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,880
yes that sounds amazing

547
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,160
how do i get into that uh the best place

548
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,120
i find to go is data camp um machine

549
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,679
learning

550
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,080
kind of models and code is often written

551
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,880
either r

552
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,280
or python i'm going to guess and say

553
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,320
most people here

554
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,840
want to use python not r i did a i did a

555
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,559
survey on this and i was very much not

556
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,880
in the majority with liking r

557
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,919
um and datacamp.com is amazing

558
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,120
for this and if you want to have a go at

559
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,039
kind of doing this on real data

560
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,320
kaggle.com

561
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,039
is bug bounties but instead of finding

562
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,640
security vulnerabilities

563
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,720
you make machine learning models same

564
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,200
idea you get paid there are

565
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,919
um people talking and doing write-ups

566
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,720
about how they

567
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,320
built their models so i just kind of

568
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,600
want to take this

569
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,679
and talk about how you build a model a

570
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,840
step-by-step guide

571
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,120
step one your data step

572
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,039
two you've got to understand the data

573
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,760
you can't just take the raw data

574
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,360
and run it through an algorithm because

575
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
all that'll give you back is terrible

576
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,559
results you've got to understand you

577
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,480
know is this biased

578
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,280
what issues does it have um what works

579
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,200
really well

580
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,840
what might be a good predictor then you

581
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,480
have

582
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,039
feature selection so you look at every

583
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,960
single value in the data set

584
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
and you look at the ones which gonna

585
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,760
provide you the most accurate results

586
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,120
you build a model um in this case this

587
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,440
is a decision tree model

588
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,320
you test the model you test its

589
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,039
precision

590
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,080
its recall sensitivity selectivity

591
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,760
accuracy f measure you do a bunch of

592
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,679
them a bunch of these maths

593
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,039
and you build the model again because

594
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,840
your first model was probably bad

595
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,039
you test the model again and

596
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,440
you use the model on your data so you

597
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,559
build this model you

598
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,960
apply it to new data and then you get

599
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,440
results back

600
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,520
and you know what that gives you it

601
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,360
gives you more data

602
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,159
and this is how you have this iterative

603
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:00,720
process

604
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,240
of designing machine learning models um

605
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,880
where you kind of end up in this sea of

606
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,440
data

607
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,240
and really your job is to kind of wade

608
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,720
through it and find meaning in that data

609
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,799
and take that meaning and show how

610
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,240
you can use it to really

611
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,720
um build and understand and create these

612
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,120
machine learning models to predict more

613
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,840
so

614
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,159
okay what about bug hunting

615
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,960
um and i'm gonna call this aka why we

616
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
won't see ai taking over bug hunting

617
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,600
i hear this a lot a lot of people are

618
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,960
very worried that ai

619
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,520
is about to take the but all of the bugs

620
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,600
um and i really want to reassure you

621
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,120
with this

622
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,280
ai is not going to take all of the bugs

623
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,600
you're going to be fine

624
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,000
so really when we look at machine

625
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,919
learning and cyber security

626
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,240
um apart from vendors who are often

627
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,520
bragging about their

628
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,000
amazing machine learning algorithms a

629
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,640
lot of it

630
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,240
is still far more in academia and

631
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,600
academic spaces and

632
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,480
isn't necessarily being operationalized

633
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
because it's actually quite difficult to

634
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
operationalize machine learning

635
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,360
especially in something like cyber

636
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,799
security where

637
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,760
one of the big kind of issues is like

638
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,960
regulation

639
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,640
and being certified for things

640
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,720
and especially when we start to consider

641
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,840
okay

642
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,360
could we build machine learning models

643
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,159
to hump bugs the research just isn't

644
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,000
there yet we don't have

645
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,280
like any of the people working on this

646
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,039
so do we need to worry about ai no

647
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,200
why don't we need to worry about ai

648
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,559
statistical models

649
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,240
need data it's so so so important

650
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,720
you cannot build machine learning

651
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,440
without

652
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,080
very large data sets you can do it on

653
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,280
small data sets

654
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,520
it just won't work it won't be accurate

655
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
it won't represent reality

656
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,840
it's just not going to work and there is

657
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,400
no

658
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,280
publicly available data set on how

659
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,039
people approach hacking

660
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,440
specifically you know what people need

661
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,080
to do is record what steps they take

662
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,600
so then we could figure out a way to

663
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,679
represent that and then kind of

664
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,520
recreate that as a machine learning

665
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,360
model it doesn't exist

666
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,799
the data isn't there when we think about

667
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,880
the evolution of machine learning and

668
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,360
kind of before we build up a data or

669
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,280
build up the data we have to kind of go

670
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,919
through

671
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,960
these stages we start out with a sea of

672
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,919
data

673
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,559
we then have to figure out you know how

674
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,120
can we

675
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,039
look at it how can we get meaning from

676
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,480
it so if we think about that with the

677
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,520
lego bricks

678
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,000
we have a pile of lego bricks when we

679
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,159
sort the lego bricks we learn more about

680
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,919
them we can see every single color that

681
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:48,880
is there

682
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
when we arrange them we understand more

683
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,960
about what shapes are available

684
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,559
and then when we present them visually

685
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,480
we can really start to understand okay

686
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,559
we have a lot of yellow and red

687
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,799
it's not until we get to that final step

688
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,480
of seeing it visually

689
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,240
that we understand the data we

690
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,080
originally started with which is a lot

691
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,960
of red and yellow bricks

692
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,440
so before you build the model even if

693
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,120
the data existed you have to

694
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,159
understand the data itself and

695
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,720
machine learning cannot represe like

696
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,360
recreate

697
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
human creativity um a lot of people

698
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
worry about like general ai

699
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,960
it's nowhere near that there's no way an

700
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,039
ai can accurately represent human

701
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,159
creativity

702
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,640
it's slaves to its data it's trained on

703
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
it can't think outside the box it can't

704
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,840
produce something new it has to go with

705
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,559
what

706
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,760
humans have already told it so the data

707
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,880
isn't there

708
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,559
even if the data was there we don't

709
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,480
really understand the data

710
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,679
and even if it was there we still

711
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,600
couldn't find unique bugs it'd just be a

712
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,080
slave to the bugs it's seen before

713
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,760
and really one of the big things the

714
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,240
community is missing is expertise

715
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
now i hope by listening to this you kind

716
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,080
of realize how much effort

717
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,840
it is to actually make a good machine

718
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,360
learning model

719
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,679
because the actual cycle and i think

720
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,799
this is a great

721
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,600
like like idea of how machine learning

722
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,000
works

723
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,520
when you start to think about it from

724
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
like a deployable piece of software

725
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,679
we need to understand the business we

726
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,200
need to understand the data

727
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,520
we need to prepare the data model it

728
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,880
evaluate it

729
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,039
and then we can deploy it the problem is

730
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,880
throughout all of this step

731
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,799
these steps here are a cycle of

732
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,440
and like slightly more and just like

733
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,880
better understood

734
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,039
even if you have all the data even if

735
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,640
it's all labeled

736
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,440
it's really easy to build a bad model

737
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,840
that

738
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,960
doesn't work um so

739
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,720
okay what do we have and what are the

740
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,400
next steps to be able to do

741
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,000
machine learning we have bounty targets

742
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,039
data

743
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,080
now this is a data set available on

744
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
uh github which has a list of all the

745
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,200
domains on

746
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,559
hacka1 on bug crowd on i think it has

747
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,000
integrity now it's got all of the

748
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
domains and what's in scope

749
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
and this is a good place to start if you

750
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,880
want to see

751
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,919
kind of what websites are available

752
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,919
and look at the domains associated with

753
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,360
them we have

754
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,400
bug bounty scans which is just scanning

755
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,000
results of different

756
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,919
domains that are available on bug bounty

757
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,120
programs

758
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,600
we have awesome bug bounty write-ups if

759
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,400
you remember

760
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,880
right to begin the presentation i talked

761
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,640
about natural language processing the

762
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,200
ability to understand text

763
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,440
so something written in human language

764
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,720
like a writer

765
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,640
could we potentially try and retrace the

766
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,720
steps i don't know it hasn't been done

767
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,840
yet

768
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,600
we have the official hacker one

769
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,039
disclosure timeline

770
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,360
again list of disclosed reports written

771
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,039
in human language

772
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,480
that's something we can look at doing

773
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
next

774
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,679
so the next steps for ai and

775
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,240
bug bounty one is we've got to

776
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,320
understand the data we have now usually

777
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,159
we do that by conducting an exploratory

778
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,600
data analysis

779
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,960
we look at the data and we just

780
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,559
visualize in different way we give it a

781
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,880
poke and see what comes out

782
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,640
we need to understand what our goals are

783
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,799
when we want ai and bug bounty do we

784
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,000
want to be able to

785
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,760
find bugs do we want to be able to do

786
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
recon activities

787
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,039
do we want to um kind of

788
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,600
i don't know look at see what bugs are

789
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,960
going to come next what bugs

790
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,120
are going to be the next big thing we

791
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,240
need to gather

792
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,960
the data the data isn't there for most

793
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,919
of this

794
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,960
we need to find it even if if we want to

795
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,720
automate the finding of bugs we need to

796
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,399
record how people hack

797
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,000
we can't do that part unless we have

798
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,159
the first part of recording people

799
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,360
hacking

800
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,279
and it's only once we go through those

801
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,679
steps we can even think about machine

802
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,200
learning methods and models being

803
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,799
applied generally to this

804
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,559
space in the field um we can't look at

805
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,360
it now

806
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,120
we're still we've got to do all these

807
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,200
other stages at least until it works

808
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,320
properly

809
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,000
and because there's just no way to get

810
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,919
an operationalized machine learning

811
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:12,720
model

812
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,760
in the space of time that kind of we're

813
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,919
looking at at the moment

814
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,960
but you know what if you can't join them

815
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,399
beat them you can hack machine learning

816
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,440
this cve was issued in 2019

817
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,720
um and this was the piece of research

818
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,360
actually done

819
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,120
um by a member of the ai village at

820
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,480
defcon um

821
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,960
who found it was by looking at email

822
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,919
headers

823
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,159
uh they were able to create a copycat

824
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,080
machine learning classification model

825
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,960
and then extract how their model worked

826
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,000
to try and

827
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,840
craft emails that would get through

828
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,679
filters

829
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,960
um this is from a really great paper um

830
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,799
talking about what the attack surface of

831
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,880
machine learning algorithms might be

832
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,520
um we have kind of issues in feature

833
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,880
extraction prediction

834
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,600
cross cost function minimization model

835
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
representation clustering

836
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,760
um and we have a bunch of these kind of

837
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,399
exploitation techniques and impacts

838
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,559
which come to some of the bugs we can

839
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,600
find

840
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,039
even if we're looking at machine

841
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,720
learning models you know what we can

842
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,559
find we can find arbitrary code

843
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,520
executions

844
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,720
we can find denial of surface us service

845
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,080
attacks

846
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,880
we can also um corrupt machine learning

847
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,840
models

848
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,120
um by giving it fake jpeg files we can

849
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,799
cause memory corruption

850
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,600
actually machine learning is becoming

851
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,279
more and more popular

852
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,159
especially with like big big big uh

853
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,760
organizations who are desperate to have

854
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,279
the next shiny new thing but don't

855
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,720
really understand the security issues

856
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,919
around it

857
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,480
this is not something to be afraid of my

858
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:48,960
friends

859
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,440
this is something that is an opportunity

860
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,960
for us all

861
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,679
so thank you very much for listening if

862
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,200
you want to follow me on any of my

863
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,039
platforms my youtube

864
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,559
is inside a phd and my twitter is inside

865
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,720
a phd

866
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,039
you can google me thank you very much

867
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,080
for listening everybody

868
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,480
that was fantastic it um i

869
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,320
really do encourage people to dig into

870
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,760
your youtube as well i know

871
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,000
um at any part of the journey there's a

872
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,600
lot to get out there i've been

873
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,000
recommending videos and intro you know

874
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,760
for people starting out but i know even

875
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,039
as someone who's done it for a few years

876
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,240
i get a lot out of your content i think

877
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,520
it's brilliant

878
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,320
but um thank you before i'm gonna be a

879
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,760
little bit selfish here before we dig

880
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,159
into

881
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,799
questions from um discord i i have a

882
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,559
personal question i wanted to ask

883
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,000
you were saying about it's very

884
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
difficult to operationalize

885
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,320
um because of lack of data do you think

886
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,919
on the inverse of that there's still a

887
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,559
lot of room for defensive team to

888
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,919
take the data that they're receiving

889
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,480
from organic traffic to start to filter

890
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,039
out

891
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,440
um malicious traffic easily or do you

892
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
think it's too noisy for that to be a

893
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,559
productive space so there's a lot of

894
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,360
research

895
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,480
on kind of those kind of steps

896
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
i don't know if there's anything we can

897
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,760
do about traffic because in general it's

898
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,679
quite difficult to do anomaly

899
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,559
detection on traffic because it is so

900
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,440
noisy

901
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,919
one thing that blue teams could do if

902
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,760
they have a bud bounty program

903
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
is actually try and gain insights from

904
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,840
reports that have been submitted

905
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
um and then make changes to their

906
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,519
program you know if they're seeing a

907
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,960
certain class of bug

908
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,120
maybe they can do internal testing for

909
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,080
it

910
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
i'd be disappointed because that means i

911
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,279
would get less bugs

912
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,840
but things like that are like a total

913
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
way that a blue team could

914
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,240
kind of not necessarily exploit their

915
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,159
own systems but use the same data to

916
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,559
solve a different problem

917
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,120
yeah that makes sense for sure and i

918
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,960
guess to to flip to one of the uh

919
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,519
the youtube questions is there a way to

920
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,360
use machine learning with reinforcement

921
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,000
learning to

922
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,760
follow the pattern of hacking to find

923
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,080
exploits so could you

924
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,000
monitor your own traffic and use that

925
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,440
for an exploratory path

926
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,640
that's a great question so i don't know

927
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,320
because the research hasn't been done

928
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,679
and you know what that means that means

929
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,640
that you

930
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
can look at it and do that research and

931
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,000
see if it works

932
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
we this is really um the first steps

933
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and i'm like i'm doing delivering this

934
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,679
presentation and i'm really giving away

935
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,519
all my ideas here

936
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,880
because there's a lot of

937
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,320
stages that one can take to really

938
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,440
um kind of push the push it forward

939
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,519
when it comes to using reinforcement

940
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,360
learning you still need quite a lot of

941
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,320
data

942
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,120
um and the question would be you know

943
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,799
who how many people are you recording

944
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,919
how diverse

945
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,159
are their hacking techniques if we're

946
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,440
just going to be doing the kind of

947
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,799
traditional reinforcement learning which

948
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,399
is hitting a bunch of buttons

949
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,720
and then rewarding it when it gets that

950
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,600
far

951
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
are we testing on ctfs how are we

952
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,360
rewarding it what kind of reward scales

953
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,559
are we looking at

954
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,080
there's so much there and you know what

955
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,679
you can do that research you can find

956
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,120
that out

957
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,480
how much i mean from from your

958
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,399
perspective working on this stuff

959
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,360
you know in context of your your phd and

960
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,039
professionally how much does it rely on

961
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,080
the target

962
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,519
being the same because i would think

963
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,640
that the other thing that would be a

964
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,440
challenge

965
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,559
um you know behind the idea that um

966
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,080
is in the question michael just asked is

967
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,760
that every target is different as well

968
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,360
you're not just talking about

969
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,159
one ctf you know framework or one you

970
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,919
know windows box on the internet or

971
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,519
whatever it's just the whole raft of

972
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,760
different stuff

973
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,120
it'd be really difficult i think

974
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,200
when it comes to what we're really

975
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,960
asking machine learning to do when it

976
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
comes to like finding bugs

977
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,120
i don't know if we're there yet i don't

978
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,960
think we have

979
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,320
the openness of how kind of like pros

980
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,840
especially approach targets

981
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,240
um that they would be willing to share

982
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,760
because that's propriet like that's

983
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,200
essentially their job

984
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,559
and they shouldn't be forced to share

985
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,840
that i should say i'm not gonna get

986
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,559
against them

987
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,440
that's totally fair for them um but i

988
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,039
think that represents a real barrier to

989
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,039
getting that type of machine learning

990
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,280
however there's a lot we can do with the

991
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,280
data we already have access to

992
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,440
you know we have hacker one publishes a

993
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,040
ton of disclosed reports

994
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,760
we have people who do write ups we have

995
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,639
bug bounty

996
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,520
uh tips on twitter we can't just think

997
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,879
of

998
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,040
what we might think as like our perfect

999
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,399
ai system as being

1000
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,320
something that can hunt for bugs but

1001
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,599
something that can do

1002
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,159
say automated recon might be a really

1003
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:32,639
nice

1004
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,639
first step in doing this kind of task

1005
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,760
but in a little bit of a different way

1006
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,000
yeah it's interesting and switching

1007
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,679
gears to to offense

1008
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,839
um just talking about that a little bit

1009
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,599
more because i think you know

1010
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,918
when i i think was the last um last

1011
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,280
stream that you and i are on together

1012
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,480
and it's like oh we should talk about

1013
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,520
aii

1014
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,599
um through this lens of an nml

1015
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,040
specifically through the lens of the

1016
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,839
fact that like

1017
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,359
we've gone and slapped it on just about

1018
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,280
everything we can think of

1019
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,520
as as you know the collective internet

1020
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,119
over the past 10 years

1021
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,079
uh and what tends to happen is when you

1022
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,440
know that sort of product development

1023
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,640
happens

1024
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,800
you find out about five years later that

1025
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
you forgot to do anything meaningful

1026
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,160
when it comes to security so

1027
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,280
yeah when you're talking about actually

1028
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,960
attacking machine learning what what are

1029
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,880
some of the things that you're

1030
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,280
seeing be effective you know how do you

1031
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,800
think about that i mean even as

1032
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,760
a hunter so there's a really interesting

1033
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,119
question in machine learning

1034
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,200
at the moment in general which is what

1035
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,240
is a bug

1036
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,520
when it comes to machine learning

1037
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,839
algorithms because we accept

1038
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,760
machine learning algorithms will make

1039
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,599
mistakes because they're not

1040
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,320
perfect um often times they might

1041
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,040
misclassify something

1042
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,000
but here's the question what time is a

1043
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,160
misclassification something a bug

1044
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,839
if we look at say i don't know image

1045
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,040
recognition

1046
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,119
if we think about our classification

1047
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,839
algorithm confusing a dog for a cat

1048
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,640
no big deal if we confuse it for not

1049
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,480
being able to recognize a person

1050
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,280
it's a self-driving car that's obviously

1051
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,560
a huge risk

1052
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,000
and what part of poisoning that

1053
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,160
algorithm can we do and this is kind of

1054
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,000
a discussion that happens within

1055
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,760
the um community at the moment like what

1056
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,240
is a bug what isn't a bug what's a bug

1057
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,880
we can actually

1058
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,839
explore um one thing that i think is

1059
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,440
really interesting is

1060
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,359
kind of the combination of machine

1061
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,200
learning and business logic

1062
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,640
because machine learning plays this

1063
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,480
really interesting part

1064
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,680
in how applications work nowadays

1065
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,240
and if you can kind of break the kind of

1066
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,000
flow the same way you can do with most

1067
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,359
with other bugs by getting a

1068
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:42,400
misclassification

1069
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,320
that's a that can be a security risk

1070
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
depending on where where it appears

1071
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,560
you don't always look for traditional

1072
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,240
security bugs sometimes you have to look

1073
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,599
something a little bit different because

1074
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,839
machine learning works a little bit

1075
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,320
differently

1076
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,079
yeah i mean the the thing i've always

1077
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,839
found fascinating about that

1078
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,640
um is the idea of you know it basically

1079
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,920
being untrusted input

1080
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,720
like anyone who who's working security

1081
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,400
for any period of time that the

1082
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,320
alarm bells immediately start ringing as

1083
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520
soon as you

1084
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,800
you see anything that looks like

1085
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,640
untrusted input um

1086
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,880
and the quintessential example is the i

1087
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,640
think it was israeli research where they

1088
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,200
spoofed the gps coordinates of a bunch

1089
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,359
of android phones to basically cause

1090
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,760
a pseudo traffic jam on the uh on the

1091
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,359
peninsula that ended up rerouting

1092
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,320
traffic

1093
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,800
um and then just a really interesting

1094
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,160
type of bug

1095
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
yeah yeah well another guy did it just

1096
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,920
recently um

1097
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,200
in europe somewhere i can't remember

1098
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,240
exactly where but he got a bunch of

1099
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,839
phones put it in the back of a

1100
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,160
like a little red wagon trolley thing

1101
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,960
yeah i saw that

1102
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,560
walked really slowly across the bridge

1103
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,079
it's like that's that's technically a

1104
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,400
machine learning attack it doesn't

1105
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,320
fit into i think the normal paradigm of

1106
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,920
computer science that we tend to think

1107
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,640
about

1108
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,800
in in bug bounty but it is basically

1109
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,960
exploitation of a

1110
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,800
you know assumption in a model that's

1111
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,640
not resilient to that type of

1112
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,079
abuse yeah and i think to add to that

1113
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,920
not only do we see these kind of new

1114
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,240
attacks we still see the same

1115
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,000
bugs you know machine learning is not um

1116
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,440
impenetrable um if you have uh

1117
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,760
kind of dealing with images dealing with

1118
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,480
kind of

1119
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,720
any kind of pre-processing you're going

1120
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,119
to hit like the traditional

1121
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,960
exploits of you know xxe

1122
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,640
or anything where you're messing with

1123
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,960
entities you can define the same books

1124
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,400
mess with image you might hear

1125
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,560
image magic for example um so really

1126
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,960
we both have to think about it as not

1127
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,000
being that different

1128
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,520
but also not being um like the same

1129
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,040
which is a really interesting space to

1130
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,760
be in i think

1131
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,240
especially as kind of this is being more

1132
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,520
operationalized now

1133
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,920
in the actual like vendors and stuff

1134
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,119
that's very cool

1135
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,359
so if we're gonna move down this path of

1136
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,079
of of taking advantage of ai what what

1137
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,760
sort of data sources would need to be

1138
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,280
available or what sort of data would you

1139
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,320
look at to

1140
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,599
to start training the models oh there's

1141
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,880
so much you can do and it's going to

1142
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,040
depend on what your expertise is

1143
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,240
i am an nlp person i think

1144
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
language is really cool for machine

1145
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,839
learning and i'm going to go off and

1146
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,200
lovely rant now

1147
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,359
the web how many way we kind of

1148
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,480
communicate with each other and we

1149
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,760
interact with the world is through

1150
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,040
language

1151
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,440
we talk to each other we write long

1152
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,640
documents

1153
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,440
if we want to share our knowledge we use

1154
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,480
language

1155
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,359
and that means it's a great place to

1156
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,960
train machine learning algorithms

1157
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
because

1158
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,240
actually it contains a lot of

1159
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,839
information especially technical

1160
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:38,960
information

1161
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,960
now i am an nlp person my first instinct

1162
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,200
is

1163
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
let's look at the disclosed reports we

1164
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,680
have loads of disclosed reports

1165
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,040
um we have a bunch of bug bounty

1166
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,599
write-ups what can we learn from those

1167
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,880
let's look at doing kind of an

1168
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,200
exploratory data analysis on what data

1169
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,760
we have

1170
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,000
you know how can we graph it what kind

1171
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,920
of information do we have access to how

1172
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,599
can we use it

1173
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,400
that'd be my first kind of step somebody

1174
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,000
who has computer vision

1175
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,280
background might say something else

1176
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,119
completely they might go for another

1177
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:11,599
type

1178
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,359
of uh looking at kind of behavioral

1179
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,480
seeing if um you could record what

1180
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
people are doing in some way

1181
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,359
um that kind of thing there's a lot of

1182
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,720
ways you can do it

1183
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,800
yeah i wonder if a computer vision

1184
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,400
person might even just take screenshots

1185
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,599
and look at the screenshots and

1186
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,880
determine what to do in a particular

1187
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,800
application just from screenshots

1188
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,200
yeah and especially if you look at um

1189
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,560
when people tend to have like

1190
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,319
include a poc include a screenshot as

1191
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,680
well what they did

1192
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,800
you know how much can we learn from

1193
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,720
those there's so many different ways to

1194
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,520
think about this

1195
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,119
we really are like infants

1196
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,319
we've got so much further we can go and

1197
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,040
i would like

1198
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,319
if you're listening to this and you

1199
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,839
found what i'm saying is really

1200
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,800
interesting or something you want to

1201
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,520
pursue

1202
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,400
go and pursue it because nobody else is

1203
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:00,960
and

1204
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,200
there's a lot you can do with what we

1205
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,839
already have access to

1206
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,160
that's awesome there's a interesting

1207
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,760
question that's kind of coming

1208
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,880
um from youtube in what you've

1209
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,000
experienced with different models and

1210
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,280
talk about different exploits have you

1211
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,240
seen any

1212
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,119
where you can essentially dos the intake

1213
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,760
with a large image or a large data flow

1214
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,319
like are there many input validation

1215
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,000
kind of bugs that you're experiencing or

1216
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,599
are they more in manipulating the

1217
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,440
outcome of the data themselves

1218
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,079
oh input manipulation is one of the

1219
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,520
primary bugs you see

1220
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,160
on main learning at the moment because

1221
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,640
where

1222
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,720
a regular application might only have

1223
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,800
one stage of processing

1224
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,040
um there is so much that happens with a

1225
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,079
machine learning

1226
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,240
it might go through you know go in

1227
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,079
through a web server go into a python

1228
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,000
script the python script then gets piped

1229
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,560
into

1230
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,720
so like go and then the go script gets

1231
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,160
piped into r

1232
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,200
um and you have so much like trent like

1233
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,359
when you hit those kind of boundaries

1234
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,440
you have another language of

1235
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,920
bugs to look at so i think it's really

1236
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,839
important also to consider that

1237
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,440
machine learning algorithms tend to be

1238
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,000
written in r and python

1239
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,920
so if you want to kind of if your

1240
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,440
application isn't written in

1241
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,200
r or python most aren't um

1242
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,599
they you're likely going to be in a

1243
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,240
position

1244
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,480
where you're having some kind of like

1245
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,920
translation between the two

1246
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,839
pieces of software great place to look

1247
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,839
for bugs in that little gap

1248
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,839
that's awesome so yeah so i guess

1249
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,839
um kind of taking a step back from

1250
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,040
bounties as well

1251
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,359
um do you see this do you see like

1252
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,119
competitive ctfs do you see

1253
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,599
machine learning starting to take a rise

1254
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,200
there or do you expect it to start to

1255
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
take a rise in that space where

1256
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,960
data might be a bit more constrained and

1257
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
available but provides you a reasonable

1258
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,640
degree of advantage um

1259
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,079
i can see it but maybe only in

1260
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,200
particular areas

1261
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,680
even the kind of big companies tend to

1262
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,560
focus their

1263
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,440
like machine learning efforts in

1264
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,359
separate areas at the moment we don't

1265
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,880
necessarily

1266
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,680
like somewhere like google is maybe

1267
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,640
going to focus on

1268
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,520
nlp because they have google translate

1269
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,040
they have a lot of like search

1270
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,119
functionality that requires a lot of nlp

1271
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,079
experience

1272
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,319
you'll have nlp people heading into

1273
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,680
um the kind of security areas as kind of

1274
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,839
domain experts basically

1275
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,440
um so i think it really depends what

1276
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,839
in-house talent they have

1277
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,640
and you just can't predict what in-house

1278
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,800
talent somebody else has

1279
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,319
um so i'd say yes but we'll see

1280
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,319
because like i said it's in the infancy

1281
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,759
we just don't really know

1282
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,680
in in terms of you know folks that are

1283
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,520
watching this and and wanting to see how

1284
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,960
that all evolves because you know i'm

1285
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,839
thinking about

1286
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,200
like the work that trailer bits have

1287
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,359
done like the the cyber grand challenge

1288
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,880
and all those sorts of

1289
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,160
you know adversarial ai um very kind of

1290
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,160
offense defense focused

1291
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,800
uh events yeah do you have any any

1292
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,720
places that you can point the audience

1293
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,440
to to

1294
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,200
kind of bone up on that i've got a

1295
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,480
follow-up question around your own bug

1296
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,520
hunting as well but just

1297
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,720
on that part i would say any kind of

1298
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,760
machine learning

1299
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,480
if you're new at this data camp is the

1300
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,200
place to go

1301
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,160
it is the best way i think as someone

1302
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,480
who's done like a looked at a few things

1303
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
to learn it because if you pick up on

1304
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,000
the academic textbooks

1305
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,319
they do not start at the important parts

1306
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,280
they start

1307
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,599
at the like statistics and they

1308
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:40,880
completely like

1309
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,359
only focus on that so it's looking and

1310
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,040
finding those places where you can

1311
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,160
kind of find the practical uses of ai

1312
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,839
i would say data camp is a great place

1313
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,440
to start from there

1314
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,839
it would be kaggle getting involved

1315
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,839
seeing what data sets are available

1316
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,359
practicing a lot of practice before you

1317
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,079
can

1318
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,119
then start to um

1319
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,760
like build up models that might be

1320
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,640
adversarial

1321
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,440
and attacking defense for sure for sure

1322
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,240
okay cool

1323
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,000
and yeah i mean the following to that is

1324
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,760
you know what if anything

1325
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,359
have have you um you have you used

1326
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,079
uh ml or ml concepts in your own bug

1327
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:20,960
hunting

1328
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,280
um if if so that would be great to hear

1329
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,240
about if not as

1330
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,839
is there you know projects that you're

1331
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,040
aware of that you can point people

1332
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,319
towards

1333
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,599
oh um yeah so i'm working on

1334
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,359
i'm working on a few tools at the moment

1335
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,880
i'm not sure how much i want to say not

1336
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,160
because i want to keep it

1337
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,319
correct i don't want to promise anything

1338
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,560
um but some of the cool tool like some

1339
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,920
of the cool work i'm working on at the

1340
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,839
moment

1341
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,240
is looking at ways to predict

1342
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,920
which vulnerabilities are going to

1343
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,440
become

1344
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,480
bigger so if we think about how

1345
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,000
vulnerabilities work

1346
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,480
we kind of get a curve almost right if

1347
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,560
we're looking at sql injection as soon

1348
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,319
as developers start to

1349
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,319
defend against sql injection not just

1350
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,760
leave it in there or they update their

1351
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,680
software we see it go down

1352
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,720
um comparatively and we can probably

1353
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,240
plot that curve for other types of

1354
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,920
vulnerabilities

1355
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,880
so what you could do is you could find

1356
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,839
figure out

1357
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,920
when something's at the peak of its

1358
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,520
curve and when it's

1359
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,920
just rising up and it's just becoming

1360
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,400
like the next big bug and some of the

1361
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,680
other stuff i'm working on is about

1362
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,480
recon

1363
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,520
and especially the apis that use normal

1364
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,319
worse

1365
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,319
normal human words and looking at ways

1366
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,319
you could for example look at the

1367
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,400
marketing text of a website and figure

1368
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:40,960
out

1369
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,640
what their api endpoints might be

1370
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,000
because they've shown off all of their

1371
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,839
features and their lovely paragraphs of

1372
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,200
text

1373
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,240
with their love or or the inverse of

1374
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,079
that and the css is just a little bit

1375
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,160
janky and there's a few typos which

1376
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,240
kind of suggests support code quality

1377
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,920
underneath the hood

1378
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,240
that sounds so much stuff you can do but

1379
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,200
that's some of the stuff that i'm

1380
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,400
working on i'm kind of working on a

1381
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,000
suite of tools at the moment to kind of

1382
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,359
do a bunch of the

1383
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,640
ai stuff um i will release it

1384
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,000
if it's operationalizable i'm not

1385
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,720
promising anything at the moment to be

1386
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,599
clear

1387
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,480
for sure but stay tuned stay tuned still

1388
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,079
exciting either way even

1389
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,440
even putting that thought maybe not

1390
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,079
releasing but it refines it for a future

1391
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,400
something else i think it's it's awesome

1392
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,680
there's um

1393
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,440
so yeah we've got one more from discord

1394
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,280
which sort of fits into the recent

1395
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,240
recent chat um do you think machining

1396
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:36,960
learning

1397
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,480
could watch you back at all when you're

1398
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,960
conducting in an engagement

1399
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,200
um or alert you maybe when the blue team

1400
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,200
is is on to you they've seen you your

1401
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,079
payloads and

1402
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,160
blocking your access is there any do you

1403
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,200
think there's anything that

1404
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,960
machine learning can help in in that

1405
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,319
area

1406
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,880
so i have a kind of general answer to a

1407
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,640
lot of questions when people say

1408
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,440
can machine learning do this if there is

1409
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,480
data

1410
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,720
and if there is an algorithm that can

1411
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,760
match that goal

1412
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,319
so if you're asking it to just classify

1413
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,440
something like

1414
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,480
uh is this likely to get caught or is it

1415
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,119
not likely to get caught

1416
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,839
or is this a sign that somebody's called

1417
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:16,480
us

1418
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,000
for example we're really looking at a

1419
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,520
classification problem

1420
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,800
um if you can boil it down to having the

1421
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,520
data

1422
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,280
and knowing which algorithm will solve

1423
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,720
it machine learning

1424
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,960
will be able to do it the problem is

1425
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,240
will it be able to do it

1426
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,280
well and i think that's a really

1427
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,800
big kind of research question really not

1428
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,200
just

1429
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,079
for um when we like talk about bug

1430
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,760
hunting but like research as in

1431
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,880
academic research as well that we don't

1432
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,240
necessarily know the question know the

1433
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,040
answer to that

1434
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,520
it's ongoing it's still something we can

1435
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,839
look at

1436
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,680
yeah that's uh that's fascinating

1437
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,000
thank you very much katie this the whole

1438
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,440
presentation was

1439
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,640
was amazing um it was i learned learned

1440
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,920
a lot and learned that i

1441
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,079
i know nothing in this space so it was

1442
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,520
it was absolutely fantastic

1443
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,160
very much yeah i'll definitely have to

1444
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,599
re-watch it probably four or five times

1445
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,160
to

1446
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,319
to pick up all the stuff i missed um but

1447
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,559
no it was was fantastic

1448
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,960
thank you uh so thank you man just a

1449
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,599
reminder

1450
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,000
that we are in the discord uh let's uh

1451
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,839
let's make sure we give katie a huge

1452
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,119
virtual round of applause

1453
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,880
and uh nice nice shirt too by the way
